Services. FASC agrees to provide to the Adviser the services indicated in Exhibit A to this Agreement (the \"Services\").\n\n2. Fees. For its Services under this Agreement, Adviser agrees to pay FASC the Services Fees calculated and payable in accordance with Exhibit B to this Agreement.\n\n3. Records. FASC shall create and maintain all necessary books and records in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to records required by Section 31(a) of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, as the same may be amended from time to time, pertaining to the Services performed by it and not otherwise created and maintained by another party. Where applicable, such records shall be maintained by FASC for the periods and in the places required by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act. The books and records pertaining to any Account which are in the possession of FAS shall be the property of such Account. The Account, or its owners or authorized representatives, shall have access to such books and records at all times during FASC's normal business hours. Upon reasonable request, copies of any such books and records shall be provided promptly by FASC to the Account or the Account's owners or authorized representatives.\n\n4.

FASC shall give prompt notice to the Adviser of the assertion of any claim or liability which is reasonably likely to result in a claim for indemnification under this Section; provided that the failure to give such notice, or any delay in giving such notice, shall not lessen the obligation of the Adviser to indemnify FASC except to the extent it results in actual prejudice. The Adviser shall have the option, by notice to FASC, to assume the defense of any claim which may be the subject of indemnification hereunder. In the event such notice is given, the Adviser shall assume the defense of the claim, and FASC shall cooperate with the Adviser in such defense, subject to the obligation of the Adviser to reimburse FASC for the expenses resulting therefrom.

FASC shall in no event compromise or settle any claim for which it may seek indemnification hereunder, except with the prior written consent of the Adviser or unless the Adviser fails, within 30 days after notice of the terms of such settlement, to notify FASC that it has assumed the defense of such claim and will indemnify FASC for any liability resulting therefrom.\n\n(c) The Adviser and FASC are each hereby expressly put on notice of the limitation of liability set forth in the Declaration of Trust of the other party.

KI, Inc. and its duly-authorized representatives shall have the right, upon reasonable notice and at reasonable hours of the day, to visit the offices of Diplomat one time each calendar quarter for the purpose of examining said books of account and records, and all other documents and materials in the possession or under the control of Diplomat, with respect to the\n\n                                       8\n\nsubject matter and terms of this Agreement, and shall have free and full access thereto for said purposes and for the purpose of making extracts therefrom. Upon demand of KI, Inc., Diplomat shall furnish to KI, Inc. a detailed statement by an independent certified public accountant showing the number, description, gross sales price, itemized deductions from gross sales price and net sales price of the products covered by this Agreement distributed and/or sold by Diplomat to the date of KI, Inc.'s demand. The cost of preparing such statement shall be borne by KI, Inc. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the prepared statement indicates that KI, Inc., received less than all royalties payable to it under this Agreement, and the differential between the royalties received and those payable amounts to more than  % of the royalties received, then the cost of such statement shall be borne by Diplomat. In the event books of account and records shall be kept available for at least two (2) years after the termination of this license.\n\n            14. Bankruptcy, Violation, Etc.\n\n                  (a) If Diplomat shall not have commenced in good faith to       manufacture or distribute in commercial quantities sunglasses and       ophthalmic frames using KI's name within three months after the date of       this Agreement, or if at any time thereafter in any six calendar month       period Diplomat fails to sell or distribute sunglasses or ophthalmic       frames, or any other product described in subparagraph 2(a) of this       Agreement, KI Inc. may give notice of such failure with respect to any       such product which has not been so manufactured or distributed during the       six calendar month period. In the event that Diplomat does not commence       selling such product in commercial quantities within 90 days after such       notice, such notice shall be deemed to be a termination of this License       with respect to such product.\n\n                  (b) If Diplomat files a petition in bankruptcy, or is       adjudicated a bankrupt, or if a petition in bankruptcy is filed against       Diplomat, or if it becomes insolvent, or it makes an assignment for the       benefit of its creditors or an arrangement pursuant to any bankruptcy law,       or if Diplomat discontinues its business, or if a receiver is appointed       for it or its business, the license hereby granted shall automatically       terminate forthwith without any notice whatsoever being necessary. In the       event this license is so terminated, Diplomat, its receivers,       representatives, trustees, agents, administrators, successors and/or       assigns shall have no right to sell, exploit or in any way deal with or in       any of the products covered by this Agreement, or any carton, container,       packing or wrapping material, advertising, promotional or display material       pertaining thereto, except with and under the special consent and       instructions of KI, Inc. in writing, which they shall be obligated to       follow.\n\n\n\n\n\n                  (c) If Diplomat shall violate any of its other material       obligations under the terms of this Agreement, KI, Inc. shall have the       right to terminate the license hereby granted upon twenty (20) days'       notice in writing, and such notice of termination shall become effective       unless Diplomat shall\n\n                                       9\n\n      completely remedy the violation within the twenty-day period and satisfy       KI, Inc. that such violation has been remedied.\n\n                  (d) Termination of the license under the provisions of this       paragraph 14 shall be without prejudice to any rights which KI, Inc. may       otherwise have against Diplomat. Upon the termination of this license,       notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all royalties on sales       theretofore made shall become immediately due and payable and no minimum       royalties shall be repayable.\n\n            15. Final Statement Upon Termination or Expiration.\n\n            Sixty (60) days before the expiration of this license and, in the event of its termination, ten (10) days after receipt of notice of termination or the happening of the event which terminates this Agreement where no notice is required, a statement showing the number and description of products covered by this Agreement on hand or in process shall be furnished by Diplomat to KI, Inc. KI, Inc. shall have the right to take a physical inventory to ascertain or verify such inventory and statement and refusal by Diplomat to submit to such physical inventory by KI, Inc. shall forfeit Diplomat's right to dispose of such inventory, KI, Inc. retaining all other legal and equitable rights KI, Inc. may have under the circumstances.\n\n            16. Disposal of Stock Upon Termination or Expiration.\n\n            Upon and after the termination of the license, and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Diplomat may dispose of products covered by this Agreement which are on hand, or in process at the time notice of termination is received, for a period of one hundred and twenty (120) days after notice of termination, provided advances and royalties with respect to that period are paid and statements are furnished for that period in accordance with paragraph 3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Diplomat shall not manufacture, sell or dispose of any products covered by this license after (a) the expiration of the license, or (b) the termination of the license based on (i) the failure of Diplomat to affix notice of copyright, trademark or service mark registration or any other notice to the products, cartons, containers, or packing or wrapping material or advertising, promotional or display material, or (ii) because of the departure by Diplomat from the quality and style approved by KI, Inc. pursuant to paragraph 9.\n\n            17. Effect of Termination or Expiration.\n\n            Upon and after the expiration or termination of this license, all rights granted to Diplomat hereunder shall forthwith revert to KI, Inc., who shall be free to license others to use KI's name in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of the products covered hereby, and Diplomat will refrain from further use of KI's name or any further reference to it, direct or indirect, or anything deemed by KI, Inc. to be similar to the KI's name, in connection with the manufacture, sale or distribution of Diplomat's products, except as provided in paragraph 17.\n\n                                       10\n\n            18. KI, Inc.'s Remedies.\n\n                  (a) Diplomat acknowledges that (except as otherwise provided       herein) its failure to commence in good faith to manufacture and       distribute in commercial quantities any one or more of the products listed       in subparagraph 2(a) within three (3) months of the date of this Agreement       and to continue during the term hereof to diligently and continuously       manufacture, distribute and sell the products covered by this Agreement,       or any class or category thereof, will result in immediate damages to KI,       Inc.\n\n                  (b) Diplomat also acknowledges that (except as otherwise       provided herein) its failure to cease the manufacture, sale or       distribution of the products covered by this Agreement, or any class or       category thereof, at the termination or expiration of this Agreement will       result in immediate and irremediable damage to KI, Inc. and to the rights       of any subsequent licensee. Diplomat acknowledges and admits that there is       no adequate remedy at law for such failure to cease manufacture, sale or       distribution, and Diplomat agrees that in the event of such failure KI,       Inc. shall be entitled to equitable relief by way of temporary and       permanent injunctions and such other further relief as any court with       jurisdiction may deem just and proper.\n\n                  (c) Resort to any remedies herein shall not be construed as a       waiver of any other rights and remedies to which KI, Inc. is entitled       under this Agreement or otherwise.\n\n            19. Excuse for Nonperformance.\n\n            Diplomat shall be released from its obligations hereunder and this license shall terminate in the event that governmental regulations or other\n\n\n\n\n\ncauses arising out of a state of national emergency, war, or causes beyond the control of the parties render performance impossible and one party so informs the other in writing of such causes and its desire to be so released. In such events, all royalties on sales theretofore made shall become immediately due and payable and no minimum royalties shall be repayable.\n\n            20. No Joint Venture.\n\n            Nothing herein contained shall be construed to place the parties in the relationship of partners or joint venturers, and Diplomat shall have no power to obligate or bind KI, Inc. in any manner whatsoever.\n\n            21. No Assignment or Sublicense by Diplomat.\n\n            This Agreement and all rights and duties hereunder are personal to Diplomat and shall not, without the written consent of KI, Inc., be assigned, mortgaged, sublicensed or otherwise encumbered by Diplomat or by operation of law.\n\n                                       11\n\n            KI, Inc. may assign its rights hereunder, but shall furnish written notice of such assignment to Diplomat.\n\n            22. No Waiver, Etc.\n\n            None of the terms of this Agreement can be waived or modified except by an express Agreement in writing signed by both parties. There are no representations, promises, warranties, covenants or undertakings other than those contained in this Agreement, which represents the entire understanding of the parties. The failure of either party hereto to enforce, or the delay by either party in enforcing, any of its rights under this Agreement shall not be deemed a continuing waiver or a modification thereof and either party may, within the time provided by applicable law, commence appropriate legal proceedings to enforce any or all of such rights. No person, firm, group or corporation (whether included in KI's name or otherwise) other than Diplomat and KI, Inc. shall be deemed to have acquired any rights by reason of anything contained in this Agreement, except as provided in paragraphs 8 and 22.\n\n            23. Additional Endorsers. If, during the term of this Agreement, Diplomat should utilize the services of any other person to endorse its products, and the public image of such person is so inconsistent with that of KI as to risk damaging the good will of KI's name should KI, Inc. continue to do business with Diplomat, then KI, Inc. shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, subject to the remedial and other provisions of paragraph 14 of this Agreement.\n\n            24. Miscellaneous Provisions.\n\n                  (a) Authority. KI, Inc. has the full right, power, legal       capacity and authority to enter into this Agreement on behalf of KI, to       carry out its terms, and to grant Diplomat the rights, licenses and       privileges granted in this Agreement.\n\n                  (b) Merger. This Agreement supersedes any and all prior       written or oral agreements between the parties.\n\n                  (c) Governing Law.

An  additional  $1,000 is payable by Franchisee to Pretzel Time as a Yogurt Fee if Yogurt Product is included in the Franchise.\n\n         4.B.     DEFERRAL OF FRANCHISE FEE.\n\n         Payment of the initial  franchise fee is deferred for  franchises to be located in Minnesota and for Minnesota  residents until the franchise Unit opens at which time the franchise fee must be paid in full to Pretzel Time.  Franchise fees for Maryland  residents  and  franchises  to be located in Maryland will be escrowed  until the unit is  opened.  There may be other  stores in which  state administrators have required fees or royalties to be deferred or escrowed.\n\n         4.C.     ROYALTY FEE.\n\n\n\n\n\n         Franchisee,  in  partial  consideration  of the  grant of a  franchise, agrees to pay to Pretzel  Time a  continuing  Royalty of seven  percent  (7%) of Franchisee's  net  revenues  (as  defined  in  Section  1) on a weekly  basis as specified in this  Section;  provided  only 4% Royalty  shall be payable on TCBY frozen yogurt and other TCBY frozen yogurt products.  The Royalty is not uniform as to  all  franchisees,  it is  fully  earned,  and  is  nonrefundable  in  any circumstance.  Franchisee  shall pay weekly by electronic  funds  transfer (ACH) without offset,  defalcation,  credit or deduction of any nature to Pretzel Time the royalty fee, the advertising  fund fee and all other amounts due and payable on each Wednesday for the immediately  preceding week. The Royalty shall be paid by electronic funds transfer from Franchisee's  general operating  account.  The Royalty is paid,  in part,  to  compensate  Pretzel  Time for  various  services provided  to  Franchisee  after the Unit opens,  including,  but not limited to, quality, service, and cleanliness inspections. Pretzel Time, upon written notice to  Franchisee,  shall  have the right to  change  the  timing  of  Franchisee's payments of Royalty  Fees and  Advertising  Fund Fees due under this  Agreement. Franchisee  shall not subordinate to any other  obligation his obligation to pay the Royalty Fee or any other fee or charge hereunder.\n\n         4.D.

Franchisee  herein  acknowledges that the Advertising Fund Fee is not uniform as to all franchisees.  The Advertising Fund Fee is fully earned and nonrefundable. The  Advertising  Fund Fee shall be paid by electronic  funds  transfer from the Franchisee's  general  operating  account on Wednesday of each week based on the preceding week's Net revenues.\n\n         4.E.

The transfer fee is non-refundable. The fee shall be due and payable by the current  Franchisee to Pretzel Time five (5) days prior to the transfer of the Franchise to the assignee.  Additionally,  the assignee  of the  Franchisee  shall pay  Pretzel  Time an  additional  amount of Twenty-Five  Thousand Dollars  ($25,000.00) (plus $1,000.00 if Yogurt Product is included),  for any  additional  units that are not existing  stores or the then current initial franchisee fee for traditional Pretzel Time Units.\n\n         4.F.     FEES FOR ADDITIONAL FRANCHISES.\n\n          In the event that Franchisee  meets Pretzel Time's  qualifications  to open  additional  Franchises at sites  acceptable to both Franchisee and Pretzel Time,  which  approval is at the sole  discretion of Pretzel  Time,  the initial franchisee  fee shall be the greater of FIVE THOUSAND  DOLLARS  ($5,000.00)(plus $1,000.00 if Yogurt  Product is included) or the then current fee for additional franchises set by Pretzel Time, at its sole discretion. The decision to grant an additional  franchise  location shall be in the sole  discretion of Pretzel Time and at no time does Pretzel Time promise or guarantee that additional franchises will be offered  or  approved.  Such  decisions  will be made on a  case-to-case basis,  based on  factors  including,  but not  limited to the  availability  of suitable locations,  quality of standards maintained in the Franchisee's current Units,   the  impact  of  additional   locations  upon  the  operations  of  the Franchisee's  current Units, the geographical  distance between the Franchisee's existing and proposed  location,  the business  plan of Pretzel  Time,  national contracts  with  major  corporations,  the  population  of  the  area  near  the prospective  site,  the quality of the site,  and other  economic  and  business factors.  Under no  circumstances  is  Franchisee  entitled to demand or require Pretzel Time to grant to Franchisee a Franchise or a similar variation thereof.\n\n         4.G.     FEES FOR RENEWAL OF FRANCHISE.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees that in consideration of the grant of the \"Successor Franchise\"  (defined in Section 5.A.),  Franchisee shall pay the current renewal fee as of the  date of  renewal  and  execute  a  general  release  in the  form prescribed  by Pretzel Time in  accordance  with Section 5.B. The renewal fee is due and payable thirty (30) days prior to the renewal day.\n\n         4.H.     PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER.\n\n         Franchisee agrees to pay all Royalties,  Advertising Fund Fees, amounts due Pretzel Time for purchases by Franchisee from Pretzel Time or its Affiliates and other amounts which  Franchisee  owes to Pretzel Time via  electronic  funds transfer from Franchisee's general account,  which shall be initiated by Pretzel Time and any transfer fees shall be paid by Franchisee  every  Wednesday for the preceding week based upon the Net Revenues.  Franchisee herein agrees to execute and complete all necessary  documentation required by Pretzel Time to permit the wire transfer to Pretzel Time (in the form attached  hereto as Exhibit E or such other form as Pretzel Time shall accept). Under this procedure, Franchisee shall authorize  Pretzel  Time to initiate  debit  entries  and/or  credit  correction entries  to  Franchisee's   general  operating  bank  account  for  payments  of Royalties,  Advertising Fund Fees and other amounts payable under this Agreement and any late or interest  charges due thereon.  Franchisee  shall make the funds\n\n\n\n\n\navailable to Pretzel Time for  withdrawal by  electronic  transfer no later than one day prior to the due date for payment therefor.  The Royalty and Advertising Fund Fees amount actually  transferred from Franchisee's  account shall be based on the Unit's Net Revenues  indicated on the reports  submitted by Franchisee as required  hereunder.  If Franchisee  has not reported the Unit's Net Revenues to Pretzel  Time  for any week as  required  herein,  then  Pretzel  Time  shall be authorized  to  debit  Franchisee's  account  in an  amount  equal  to the  fees transferred from Franchisee's  account for the last reporting period for which a report of the Unit's Net  Revenues  was  provided  to Pretzel  Time as  required hereunder.  If,  at any  time,  Pretzel  Time  determines  that  Franchisee  has under-reported the Unit's Net Revenues, or underpaid Royalty or Advertising Fund Fees or other  amounts  due  hereunder,  Pretzel  Time  shall be  authorized  to initiate  immediately a debit to Franchisee's  account in the appropriate amount in  accordance  with the foregoing  procedure,  plus interest as provided for in this  Agreement.  Any  overpayment  shall be  credited to  Franchisee's  account through a credit  effective  as of the first week after  Franchisee  and Pretzel Time  determine  that such credit is due.  Notwithstanding  any  designation  by Franchisee, Pretzel Time shall have the sole discretion to apply any payments by Franchisee to any past  indebtedness  of Franchisee  for Royalty or  Advertising Fund Fees,  purchases from Pretzel Time and/or its  Affiliates,  interest or any other indebtedness,  including,  without  limitation,  payment of rental sums in arrears for the Unit.\n\n         4.I.     LATE CHARGE AND INTEREST.\n\n         To compensate Pretzel Time for the increased  administrative expense of handling late payments,  Pretzel Time may charge Franchisee a $50.00 late charge for each delinquent payment.  All Royalty and Advertising Fund Fees, amounts due for  purchases by  Franchisee  from Pretzel  Time or its  Affiliates,  and other amounts  which  Franchisee  owes to Pretzel  Time or its  Affiliates  shall bear interest  after  their due date at a rate equal to the  lesser of: (1)  eighteen percent (18%) per annum for the number of days which such payment is due; or (2) the highest  applicable  legal rate  permitted  by  applicable  law.  Franchisee acknowledges  that this  Section  shall  not  constitute  Pretzel  Time's or its Affiliates' agreement to accept such payments after they are due or a commitment by Pretzel  Time or its  Affiliates  to extend  credit to or  otherwise  finance operation of the Unit.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of this Section  4.I., Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees that his failure to pay all amounts when due shall constitute grounds for termination of this Agreement.\n\n5.

FRANCHISEE'S RIGHT TO A SUCCESSOR FRANCHISE.\n\n         Upon the expiration of the initial term of this  Agreement,  Franchisee shall  have the one time  right to obtain a  successor  franchise  to  operate a Pretzel  Time Unit at the Site (a  \"Successor  Franchise\")  for a single term of five (5) years  immediately  following the expiration of the initial term of the Franchise upon giving Pretzel Time six (6) months notice prior to the expiration of the then current term if:\n\n         (1) Franchisee and its Owners have complied with this Agreement and any          amendment  during the initial  term of this  Agreement  in all material          respects; and\n\n         (2) Franchisee  maintains  possession of the Site and agrees to remodel          and/or expand the Unit, add or replace equipment, furnishings, fixtures          and signs and  otherwise  modify  the Unit to bring it into  compliance          with   specifications  and  standards  then  applicable  under  new  or          Successor Franchises for Pretzel Time Units; or if Franchisee is unable          to maintain  possession  of the Site, or if, in the judgment of Pretzel          Time,  the Unit should be  relocated,  Franchisee  secures a substitute          site approved by Pretzel Time and agrees to develop  expeditiously such          substitute  site in compliance with  specifications  and standards then          applicable  under new or successor  franchises  for Pretzel Time units;          and\n\n         (3) Pretzel  Time has not given notice of its election not to renew six          (6) months  prior to the  expiration  of the  initial  twenty (20) year          term; and\n\n         (4)  Franchisee  is not in default of any material term or condition of          the lease  agreement,  or any other agreement  between Pretzel Time and          Franchisee; and\n\n         (5) Franchisee executes Pretzel Time's then current Franchise Agreement          and  other  ancillary  agreements  required  and being  offered  to new          Franchisees on the date of renewal, which agreements shall supersede in          all respects this  Agreement and the terms of which may differ from the          terms of this Agreement,  including,  without limitation,  Royalty Fees          and  Advertising  Fund  Fees,  other  fees  and  charges,   performance          criteria,  and a provision which allows Pretzel Time and its Affiliates          to reserve  the right,  both within and  outside of the  Territory,  to          offer and sell at wholesale or retail, through channels of distribution          distinct  from  those  of a  Franchise,  Products  and  services  which          comprise,  or may in the  future  comprise a part of the  Pretzel  Time          System, which Products may be resold at retail to the general public by          such entities; and\n\n         (6) Franchisee is in full  compliance  with Pretzel  Time's  Operations Manual; and\n\n         (7) On renewal,  Franchisee  agrees to pay the current renewal fee, the          Royalty and  Advertising  Fund fees specified in Pretzel Time's current\n\n\n\n\n\n         Franchise  Agreement then being offered new  Franchisees on the date of          renewal; and\n\n         (8) Franchisee shall execute general releases,  in form satisfactory to          Pretzel  Time,  of any and all  claims  against  Pretzel  Time  and its          Affiliates and their officers, directors, employees, agents, successors          and assigns arising under this Agreement; and\n\n         (10)   Franchisee   has  complied  with  Pretzel  Time's  then  current          qualification and training requirements.\n\n         Following receipt of Franchisee's election to renew, Pretzel Time shall provide Franchisee with an execution copy of the form of Franchise  Agreement to be entered into for the renewal  term.  If the  Franchisee  does not execute and return the renewal Franchise Agreement within thirty (30) days of receipt,  then Franchisee  shall be deemed to have  withdrawn  its notice of renewal,  and this Agreement shall terminate at the end of the current term.\n\n         Pretzel Time may, at its option, with reasonable cause and upon written notice,  elect not to renew the Franchise  Agreement.  Pretzel Time shall notify Franchisee  of the  nonrenewal  not  less  than  six  (6)  months  prior  to the expiration  of the term of this  Agreement.  If  applicable  law  requires  that Pretzel Time give longer  notice to  Franchisee  prior to the  expiration of the term than is specified in the Franchise Agreement,  the Franchise Agreement will remain in effect on a  month-to-month  basis until the requisite notice has been given.\n\n         5.B.     RELEASES.\n\n         Franchisee  and its Owners  shall  execute  general  releases,  in form satisfactory  to Pretzel Time (the  general form of which is attached  hereto as Exhibit \"K\"), of any and all claims against  Pretzel Time and its Affiliates and their  respective  shareholders,   officers,   directors,   employees,   agents, successors and assigns. Failure by Franchisee and its Owners to sign and deliver to Pretzel  Time,  such  agreements  and releases  within thirty (30) days after delivery  thereof to Franchisee shall be deemed an election by Franchisee not to obtain a Successor Franchise.\n\n         5.C.     NOTICES.\n\n         Franchisee  shall give Pretzel  Time written  notice of its election to obtain a Successor  Franchise not more than twelve (12) months and not less than six (6) months prior to the expiration of this Agreement.

Such notice  shall state what  actions Franchisee  must take to correct  the  deficiencies  and shall  specify the time period in which such  deficiencies  must be  corrected.  Pretzel Time shall give Franchisee written notice of a decision not to grant a Successor Franchise based upon  Franchisee's  failure to cure  deficiencies not less than ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the initial term of this Agreement.

Franchisee acknowledges  and agrees that Pretzel Time is under no  obligation  to approve a relocation of the Franchise.  However,  upon written approval from Pretzel Time, Franchisee may relocate the Franchise to another  location.

Any such  relocation of the Franchise is subject to Pretzel Time's prior  approval of the new Unit  location.

FRANCHISEE TRAINING.\n\n         10.A.    INITIAL TRAINING.\n\n         Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees that, while Pretzel Time's training program will provide  Franchisee  with the  fundamental  knowledge  necessary to operate a unit,  Franchisee  cannot  expect  success  unless he devotes his best personal efforts to the business and exercises good business judgment in dealing with customers,  suppliers, and employees.  Prior to the Unit's opening, Pretzel Time shall  furnish an initial  training  program on the  operation of a Pretzel Time Unit which shall take place at Pretzel Time's  headquarters  in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,  or at a location  which will  provide the best  training  for the\n\n\n\n\n\nFranchisee,  which may or may not be close to Pretzel Time's  headquarters.  The Franchisee agrees that he and his Unit Manager shall attend the initial training session held four (4) to eight (8) weeks prior to the Unit's  projected  opening date. Pretzel Time will not charge for the initial training of the Franchisee or if a corporation or partnership,  the Principal Owners of the Franchisee and the Unit  Manager.  All  incidental  expenses  relative  to the  required  training, including  travel  expenses,  hotel/motel  expenses,  and  meals  shall  be  the responsibility  of  the  Franchisee  while  attending  training.  Prior  to  the commencement  of the  operation  of the Unit,  the  manager  of the Unit  (\"Unit Manager\") and the  Franchisee or if a corporation or  partnership,  one Owner of the Franchisee as identified in Exhibit B, who will be personally overseeing the Unit shall attend and  successfully  complete the Pretzel Time initial  training program to the satisfaction of Pretzel Time.\n\n         The  Franchisee  and his  Unit  Manager  must  satisfactorily  complete Pretzel  Time's  training as  determined  by Pretzel  Time, in its sole opinion, before  Franchisee is allowed to operate the Franchise.  If Pretzel Time, in its sole discretion, determines that Franchisee is unable to satisfactorily complete the  training  program,  Pretzel  Time  shall have the right to  terminate  this Agreement and no franchise fees shall be refunded.  The initial training program shall cover material aspects of the operation of a Pretzel Time Unit,  including financial   controls,   employee  relations,   food  preparation,   service  and operational techniques,  sampling, recipes and cooking procedures, marketing and public  relations,  cleanliness and maintenance  procedures,  and maintenance of Pretzel  Time  System  standards.  Franchisee  shall  receive  one  copy  of the Operations Manual, which cannot be reproduced, in whole or in part. In the event that  the  Franchisee's  copy  is  lost  destroyed  or  significantly   damaged, Franchisee  shall be  obligated  to obtain from Pretzel  Time,  at  Franchisee's expense a replacement copy of the Operations Manual.\n\n         10.B.    EMPLOYEE TRAINING.\n\n         Pretzel  Time may  provide  to  Franchisee,  at  Franchisee's  request, guidance in the selection of a Unit Manager and may provide periodic evaluations of  Franchisee's  Unit,  Managers  and  employees,  but  without  any  liability therefore to Pretzel Time. Franchisee shall hire all employees of the franchise, be exclusively  responsible for the terms of their employment and  compensation, and  implement a training  program for  employees of the  franchise.  Franchisee agrees  to  maintain  a staff  of  trained  employees  to  operate  the  Unit in compliance with Pretzel Time's standards.\n\n         In the event the Unit Manager ceases to hold such full-time position at the  Unit,  Franchisee  shall  have  thirty  (30)  days in  which to  appoint  a substitute  or  replacement  Unit  Manager,  who must  attend  and  successfully complete,  to  Pretzel  Time's  satisfaction  the  initial  training  program as specified  above within sixty (60) days after  employment  as Unit  Manager.  If Pretzel  Time in its sole  discretion  determines  that the Unit  Manager or any subsequently  appointed Unit Manager has failed to  satisfactorily  complete the initial  training  program or any  additional  or  refresher  training  program, Franchisee  agrees to  immediately  hire a substitute  Unit Manager and promptly arrange  for such  person  to  complete  the  initial  training  program  to the satisfaction  of Pretzel Time.  Franchisee  agrees to notify Pretzel Time of any new  Unit  Managers  for the  Unit  within  seven  (7)  business  days of  their employment.  In the event  Franchisee  operates more than one (1) Unit, at least one (1)  trained and  competent  Unit  Manager  referred to above shall act as a full-time manager in each Territory. Franchisee shall keep Pretzel Time informed at all times of the identity of any Unit Manager(s) of the Unit.\n\n         All Unit  Managers  of the Unit must  have  successfully  completed  an initial training program as specified by Pretzel Time at the sole expense of the Franchisee, including, but not limited to, salary and incidental travel expenses attendant to any training provided by Pretzel Time. Franchisee and Unit Managers who  successfully  complete  training will receive a Training  Certificate  from Pretzel Time.  Pretzel Time shall make training  available to Franchisee's  Unit Manager during Pretzel Time's regularly  scheduled training course. In no event, will  Pretzel Time be under any  obligation  to provide  individual  training to Franchisee's  Unit  Managers.  Franchisee  agrees that each Unit  Manager  shall participate at Franchisee's  expense in Pretzel Time's initial  training program and all other mandatory  training  programs which may subsequently be offered by Pretzel Time.\n\n         10.C.  ON-SITE TRAINING.\n\n         Additionally,   Pretzel   Time  will   provide   on-site   training  at Franchisee's  business  location for a period of five (5) days,  generally to be commenced  immediately  prior to  Franchisee's  day of opening and continued the first three (3) days of operation.  Franchisee  herein agrees to notify  Pretzel Time,  in writing,  of his opening  date  twenty (20) days prior  thereto.  This training  will include all  functions  required for the proper  operation of the franchise.\n\n         Should Franchisee  request  additional  assistance from Pretzel Time in order to facilitate  the opening of the  Franchise,  and should Pretzel Time, in its discretion,  deem it necessary,  feasible and appropriate to comply with the request or should Pretzel Time determine that  additional  training is required, Franchisee  shall  reimburse  Pretzel Time at Pretzel  Time's then current daily training  service fee, for the expense of Pretzel Time providing such additional assistance and for its training  related  expenses,  which may include,  travel, room and board.\n\n         10.D.    COMPANY GROWTH.\n\n         Throughout  the  term of  this  Agreement,  Pretzel  Time  may  provide Franchisee  with  information  on company  growth and  operations as well as new\n\n\n\n\n\ntechniques developed to reduce costs and/or enhance sales or profits.\n\n         10.E.    RETRAINING PROGRAMS.\n\n         Pretzel  Time shall  provide  re-training  programs  at a  location  of Pretzel Time's choice from time to time for  experienced  franchisees  and their managers and/or employees.  Pretzel Time may charge fees for refresher  training courses  for  previously  trained  and  experienced  managers.  Fees for special programs will be based upon Pretzel Time's actual costs and attendance  shall be required. Attendance at retraining programs or seminars shall be at Franchisee's sole expense,  provided,  however,  that attendance will not be required at more than two (2) such  programs  in any  calendar  year and shall  not  collectively exceed ten (10) business days in duration during any calendar year.\n\n         10.F.    OTHER GUIDANCE.\n\n         Pretzel  Time may  advise  Franchisee  from  time to time of  operating problems of the Unit which come to Pretzel Time's attention and, at Franchisee's request but without any liability  therefore to Pretzel Time, Pretzel Time shall furnish to Franchisee guidance in connection with:                             (i)  Methods,  standards,   specifications  and  operating  procedures                utilized by Pretzel Time Units;\n\n          (ii) Purchasing  required  fixtures,  furnishings,  equipment,  signs,                Products, materials and supplies;\n\n          (iii) Advertising and Promotional programs;\n\n          (iv) Employee training; and\n\n          (v)  Administrative, bookkeeping, accounting and general operating and                management procedures.\n\nSuch guidance shall, in Pretzel Time's  discretion,  be furnished in the form of Pretzel  Time's  Operations  Manual,  bulletins  and  other  written  materials, electronic computer messages,  telephone  conversations  and/or consultations at Pretzel Time's offices or at the Unit. Pretzel Time will make no separate charge to  Franchisee  for  such  operating  assistance  as  Pretzel  Time  customarily provides.  From time to time, Pretzel Time may make special assistance  programs available to  Franchisee,  however,  Franchisee  will be required to pay the per diem fees and charges that Pretzel Time  establishes  from time to time for such special assistance programs.\n\n11.      ADVERTISING AND OTHER PROMOTIONS.\n\n         11.A.    PROVIDING OF ADVERTISING MATERIALS.\n\n         Franchisee  and Pretzel Time agree and  recognize  the value of uniform advertising to the goodwill and public image of Pretzel Time Units. Pretzel Time has  instituted  and  maintains and  administers  an  advertising  fund for such advertising  or  public  relations   programs  as  Pretzel  Time,  in  its  sole discretion,  may deem  necessary  or  appropriate  to  advertise  or promote the Pretzel Time System,  nationally or regionally.  Pretzel Time will  periodically provide Franchisee with programs,  promotional  concepts,  and other information designed to enhance the operation of the  Franchise.  In addition,  Pretzel Time may  provide  optional  special  promotions  from time to time  which will be at Franchisee's cost, which may be mandatory. At its initial opening, Pretzel Time, at  Franchisee's  expense,  shall  designate  and supply an initial  quantity of forms,  literature,   display,  and  promotional  materials.  Pretzel  Time,  in consideration of the Advertising Fund Fee, shall periodically provide Franchisee with  camera  ready  advertising  materials.   Multiple  copies  of  advertising materials will be furnished to Franchisee for an additional  fee,  including any related shipping, handling and storage charges.\n\n         11.B.    CONTROL OF ADVERTISING PROGRAMS AND CONCEPTS.\n\n         Pretzel Time shall direct all such programs,  with sole discretion over the creative concepts, materials,  endorsements, and media used therein, and the placement  and  allocation  thereof.   The  manner,   media  and  cost  of  such advertising,  public  relations  and  promotional  mailings  shall be solely and completely  within the  discretion of Pretzel Time.  Pretzel Time shall have the right to determine, in its sole discretion,  the target and market areas for the development  and  implementation  of such  programs.  Pretzel  Time may  expend, disburse and use funds from the Advertising  Fund, in its sole  discretion,  for the following purposes:\n\n                  (1) The  creation  and  development  of nonlocal  advertising,          promotional campaigns,  and public relations to promote and enhance the          value of the Service  Marks and the  business  of all the Pretzel  Time          retail establishments;\n\n                  (2) Payments to Pretzel Time of such reasonable sums as may be          necessary  for actual  costs of  advertising  production,  direct  mail          purchases, and other media marketing tools;\n\n                  (3) Payment of salaries and  benefits  for staff  personnel in          the  marketing  and  public  relations  department  as  well  as  other          administrative  costs and overhead expenses of the department  incurred          by Pretzel Time;\n\n                  (4) The  costs of  employing  advertising,  marketing,  public          relations and promotion  agencies to assist in preparing and conducting          media programs and activities and supporting public  relations,  market\n\n\n\n\n\n         research and other advertising, promotion and marketing activities;\n\n                  (5) Market  research  expenditures  related to the development          and evaluation of the effectiveness of advertising and sales promotion;          and\n\n                  (6)  Costs  of  organizing   and  providing   facilities   for          international, national, or regional franchisee conferences.\n\n         Franchisee  understands and  acknowledges  that the Advertising Fund is intended to maximize  recognition  of the Marks and  patronage  of Pretzel  Time Units.  Although  Pretzel Time will endeavor to utilize the Advertising  Fund to develop   advertising  and  marketing   materials  and  programs  and  to  place advertising that will benefit all Pretzel Time Units, Pretzel Time undertakes no obligation to ensure that  expenditures by the Advertising  Fund in or affecting any geographic area are  proportionate or equivalent to the contributions to the Advertising Fund by Pretzel Time Units operating in that geographic area or that any  Pretzel  Time  Units  will  benefit   directly  or  in  proportion  to  its contribution  to the  Advertising  Fund from the  development of advertising and marketing materials or the placement of Advertising.\n\n         11.C.    SEGREGATION OF ADVERTISING FUND.\n\n         Pretzel  Time  herein   agrees  to   administratively   segregate   the Advertising  Fund on its books and  records.  Fees paid by  Franchisee  into the advertising  fund  shall  not  under any  circumstance  be used for the  general operating  expenses of Pretzel Time but shall and will be used  exclusively  for advertising  as outlined  herein.  Pretzel  Time may spend in any fiscal year an amount greater or less than the aggregate  contributions  of the  franchisees to the fund in that  year and  Pretzel  Time  may  make  loans to the fund  bearing reasonable  interest  to cover  any  deficits  of the fund and cause the fund to invest any surplus for future use by the fund. It is anticipated,  and it is the intent of Pretzel Time that all  contributions to the Fund shall be expended for advertising  and  promotional  purposes during Pretzel Time's fiscal year within which  contributions  are made.  Any monies not  expended  in the fiscal year in which they were  contributed  shall be applied and used for Fund expenses in the following year.\n\n                   11.D. SUSPENSION OF ADVERTISING FUND FEES.\n\n         Pretzel  Time  reserves  the right to  suspend  contributions/fees  and operations of the  Advertising  Fund for one or more  periods,  and the right to terminate the  Advertising  Fund, upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Franchisee.  All unspent monies on the date of termination  shall be distributed to Pretzel Time's  franchisees and Pretzel Time, its Affiliates and designees in proportion to their  respective  contributions  to the Advertising Fund upon the same terms and  conditions set forth herein upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice Franchisee.\n\n         11.E.    FRANCHISEE'S REQUIRED ADVERTISING EXPENDITURES.\n\n         In addition to any contributions by Franchisee to the Advertising Fund, Franchisee is required to spend on marketing and related programs such amount as is  required  pursuant  to the terms and  conditions  of  Franchisee's  lease or sublease.  Franchisee  acknowledges  such amounts will vary from lease to lease, and therefore, all Pretzel Time Unit franchisees will not be obligated to expend the same amount on local advertising and marketing of the Unit.\n\n         11.F.    USE OF TRADEMARK REFERENCES AND APPROVAL                   OF FRANCHISEE'S MARKETING.\n\n         Franchisee further agrees that all advertising, promotion and marketing by Franchisee shall be completely clear and factual and not misleading and shall conform to the highest  standards of ethical  marketing and  promotion  policies which may be prescribed from time to time by Pretzel Time.  Franchisee agrees to use the  registration  symbol of \"R\" within a circle (7 ) in connection with its use of the Marks.  Franchisee  agrees to refrain  from any business or marketing practice  which may be  injurious  to the  business of Pretzel Time and the good will associated with the Marks and other Pretzel Time Units.  Prior to their use by  Franchisee,  all  press  releases,  literature,  and  samples  of all  local advertising, marketing, point-of-purchase, and related materials not prepared or previously  approved  by Pretzel  Time shall be  submitted  to Pretzel  Time for approval,  which shall not be unreasonably  withheld.  If written disapproval is not received within twenty (20) days from the date of receipt by Pretzel Time of such  materials,  Pretzel Time shall be deemed to have  approved the  materials. Franchisee  agrees not to use  promotional or advertising  materials  which have been  disapproved  by Pretzel Time or that have not been approved for use within the preceding twelve months.\n\n         In  addition,  any  pamphlets,  brochures,  cards or other  promotional materials  offering  free Products may only be used if prepared by Pretzel Time, unless  otherwise  approved  in  advance by Pretzel  Time.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing, Pretzel Time will give favorable consideration to Franchisee's use of free product cards developed by Franchisee, if the cards clearly state that they may only be  redeemed  at Pretzel  Time Units  owned by  Franchisee.  Franchisee agrees to list and advertise the Franchise in the regular white pages  telephone directories distributed within Franchisee's metropolitan area.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees to distribute and display at Franchisee's  location, literature,  display and promotional  materials  including  special  promotional materials  as  Pretzel  Time may from  time to time make  available.  Franchisee agrees that only those advertising,  promotional  materials,  or items which are authorized  by  Pretzel  Time in  writing  prior to use  shall be used,  sold or\n\n\n\n\n\ndistributed,  and no  alternate  display or use of the Pretzel Time Service Mark shall be made without the prior written permission of Pretzel Time.  Replacement or updated literature, display,  point-of-purchase and promotional materials may be obtained from Pretzel Time for a fee including shipping.\n\n12.

Such  Operations  Manual provisions and all reasonable  modifications shall be binding upon Franchisee to the same extent as if set forth verbatim in this Franchise  Agreement,  and such provisions  may be  changed  from  time to time by  Pretzel  Time,  in its  sole discretion,  provided that changes are  reasonably  designed to enhance  Pretzel Time's  Products,  the Pretzel  Time  System,  or  franchise  operation  and are uniformly  applied  with  respect  to all  franchisees.

Such a remodeling may include extensive  structural changes to          the Unit  fixtures and  improvements  as well as such other  changes as          Pretzel Time may direct and Franchisee  shall  undertake such a program          promptly upon notice from Pretzel Time;  provided the remodeling  shall          not be  required  until  such time as  Pretzel  Time has  commenced  or          completed a similar  program in at least fifty  percent  (50%) of those          Pretzel Time Units owned and operated by Pretzel Time. This requirement          shall not apply in the  event  notice  from  Pretzel  Time is  received          during the last year of the term hereof or the term of any agreement by          virtue of which Franchisee occupies the Unit.\n\n         In addition to Pretzel Time's rights to terminate this Agreement as set forth herein,  if Franchisee  does not maintain the condition and  appearance of the Unit as herein  required,  Pretzel  Time,  may,  upon not less than ten (10) days'  written  notice  (or, in cases of health or  sanitation  hazards or other public endangerment, immediately on oral or written notice) to Franchisee:\n\n          (i)  arrange  for  the  necessary  cleaning  or  sanitation,   repair,                remodeling, upgrading, painting or decorating; or\n\n          (ii) replace the necessary fixtures, furnishings, equipment, signs.\n\n         If Franchisee  fails or refuses to initiate  within ten (10) days after receipt  of  a  notice  that  the  general  state  of  repair,  appearance,  and cleanliness of your store does not meet Pretzel Time's standards, and thereafter continue in good faith and with due  diligence a bona fide  program to undertake and complete required  maintenance or refurbishing,  Pretzel Time has the right, but is not  obligated,  to enter upon the  premises  of the Unit and effect such maintenance and  refurbishing on Franchisee's  behalf,  and Franchisee shall pay the entire cost thereof to Pretzel Time on demand.\n\n         13.B.  UNIT MENU.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees that the Unit shall offer for sale all  Products and no other  products,  which Pretzel Time, in its sole  discretion,  may authorize and/or require from time to time for the Unit.  Franchisee  agrees that the Unit shall not offer for sale or sell any  Products  or  services at or from the Unit which have not been  approved in writing by Pretzel Time or use the Site or Unit for any purpose  other than the  operation  of a Pretzel  Time Unit.  Franchisee agrees that the Unit shall not sell any  Products at, from or away from the Site until Pretzel Time, in its sole discretion,  has approved the same, provided the foregoing  shall not limit  Franchisee  to sample in front of the lease  line as limited in  Franchisee's  lease.  Pretzel Time  reserves the right to change the types of  authorized  Products and require  Franchisee to offer to sell and sell the  new,  modified  or  substituted  Products.  Pretzel  Time may  develop  new Products,  methods  of  operations,  and  standards  and may  provide  you  with information about developments.  Franchisee also acknowledges and agrees that if Pretzel Time requires the Unit to use new or  substitute  products not currently offered at Pretzel  Time  Units,  Franchisee  agrees to offer such  Products  in compliance  with  Pretzel  Time's   specifications,   standards  and  procedures prescribed in the  Operations  Manuals or otherwise in writing and to diligently pursue  obtaining  any  permits  and  take  such  actions  (including,   without limitation,  constructing  improvements  and  acquiring  fixtures,  furnishings, equipment,  supplies, and materials) required to offer such Products. Franchisee acknowledges  and  understands  that such  modifications  to the  Products to be offered  by the Unit  may  require  Franchisee  to incur  additional  costs  and expenses to operate the Unit, including, without limitation, the purchase and/or lease of additional or substitute furnishings,  furniture, fixtures or equipment and Franchisee agrees to incur such expenses in connection therewith.\n\n         13.C.    ADHERENCE TO APPROVED ITEMS.\n\n\n\n\n\n         The  reputation  and goodwill of all Pretzel Time Units are based upon, and can only be maintained by, the sale of  distinctive,  high-quality  Products and the  presentation,  packaging  and service of Products in an  efficient  and appealing  manner.  Pretzel  Time has  developed  and shall  continue to develop certain  proprietary food products which will be prepared by or for Pretzel Time according to Pretzel Time's recipes and formulas. Pretzel Time has developed and shall continue to develop  standards and  specifications  for fresh  hand-rolled pretzels, frozen pretzels,  pretzel toppings,  beverages and other healthy snack food  products,   materials  and  supplies   incorporated  in  or  used  in  the preparation, baking, or serving of Products authorized by Pretzel Time. The need for quality and quantity control in the Products offered for sale at the Unit is acknowledged  by  Franchisee.  All  Products  offered by  Franchisee  must be of uniform  quality and quantity  and offered for sale to the public in  accordance with Pretzel Time's  specifications  as set forth in Pretzel  Time's  Operations Manual and as may be amended from time to time.\n\n         Pretzel  Time has  approved  and shall  review and  continue to approve suppliers and  distributors  of the  foregoing  Products,  supplies,  materials, equipment,  fixtures  and  machines  that  meet  Pretzel  Time's  standards  and requirements  including,  without  limitation,  quality,  quantity and portions, prices,  output requirements,  distribution methods and locations,  standards of service, financial capability,  customer service and other criteria.  Franchisee agrees that minimum standards for items of inventory,  Products,  machines,  and equipment  may  be  recognized  by  brand  name  rather  than  by  technical  or engineering description.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees  that  it  will  use  all  equipment  and  Products, including, without limitation, food products,  smallwares,  equipment, and paper products as designated by Pretzel Time and shall purchase Pretzel Time's private label  food  products,   materials,  supplies  and  proprietary  food  products, ingredients,  spices, sauces, mixes,  beverages,  materials and supplies used in the  preparation of Products  developed by or for Pretzel Time or its Affiliates whether or not pursuant to a special recipe or formula or bearing the Marks only from Pretzel  Time,  its  Affiliates  or  non-affiliated  sources  designated by Pretzel Time.  Franchisee  further agrees to purchase only from distributors and suppliers  approved  or  required by Pretzel  Time.  Franchisee  agrees that the approved Products, equipment, smallwares, and inventory used on the premises may alter from time to time as Pretzel Time reasonably deems  necessary.  Franchisee agrees to offer for sale only those  Products  approved  by Pretzel  Time and no others without the prior written approval of Pretzel Time. Franchisee shall not, after receipt in writing of any modification of an approved or required supplier or distributor,  manufacturer  of equipment,  products,  materials,  supplies or other items  reorder any product  from any  supplier or  distributor  that is no longer  approved.  Pretzel Time may approve or require a single  distributor  or supplier  for any  Products,  materials or supplies and may approve or require a distributor or supplier only as to certain products, materials and supplies, and such approval may be temporary pending a further  evaluation of such distributor or supplier by Pretzel Time. Pretzel Time may concentrate  purchases with one or more distributors or suppliers to obtain lower prices and/or advertising support and/or  services for the benefit of Pretzel Time, the Pretzel Time System and/or Pretzel Time Units.\n\n         Pretzel Time will loan to Franchisee a list of approved  brand Products for use during the term of this  Franchise  Agreement  at the  initial  training session.  Franchisee  agrees to not copy the list.  Franchisee will,  during the term of this Agreement and after its  termination  or  expiration,  maintain the list  and its  contents  in  strict  confidence,  and  upon  the  expiration  or termination of this Franchise Agreement,  whichever is earlier, will immediately return it to Pretzel Time.  Pretzel Time shall promptly provide  Franchisee with any  amendments to the  designated  list of inventory of available  Products and supplies to be carried and sold at Franchisee's  location.  Franchisee  shall at all times  maintain an adequate  inventory of approved  Products  sufficient  in quality and variety to realize the full potential of the Unit.\n\n         13.D.    EXCEPTION PROCESS.\n\n         If   Franchisee   proposes  to  purchase   materials  or  supplies  not theretofore  approved by Pretzel Time as meeting its  specifications,  or from a supplier or  distributor  not  previously  approved by Pretzel Time,  Franchisee shall first notify Pretzel Time and request  Pretzel  Time's  approval using the special exception form provided to Franchisee in its Operations  Manual, and pay any reasonable fees that Pretzel Time designates therefor.  Further,  Franchisee agrees to use all forms  specified and developed by Pretzel Time for  requesting any exceptions in products or suppliers.  Pretzel Time may require submission of sufficient information and samples to determine whether such materials, supplies or suppliers meet its specifications as well as financial  information regarding the  supplier.  Pretzel Time will advise  Franchisee  within a  reasonable  time whether such\n\nmaterials or supplies meet its specifications.  Pretzel Time does not maintain a formal criteria for approving materials,  supplies or suppliers.  All approvals, disapprovals  and  revocations of approval of suppliers will be  communicated to Franchisee,  in writing,  and shall be in the sole  discretion  of Pretzel Time. Franchisee  must  comply  with  the  following  conditions  in  order  to seek a substitution for a Pretzel Time approved Product:\n\n                  (1) Franchisee  shall submit a written request to Pretzel Time\n\n\n\n\n\n                  for approval of a non-approved supplier or product;\n\n                  (2)  Franchisee  and  supplier  shall  demonstrate  to Pretzel                   Time's  reasonable  satisfaction that it is able to supply the                   commodity  which  meets  Pretzel  Time's   specifications   to                   Franchisee; and\n\n                  (3)  The  supplier   shall   demonstrate   to  Pretzel  Time's                   reasonable  satisfaction that the supplier is of good standing                   in the  business  community  with  respect  to  its  financial                   soundness and the  reliability  of its product and service and                   shall  request  in  writing  to  Pretzel  Time to be  named an                   approved supplier.\n\n         13.E.  PROMOTIONAL ALLOWANCES.\n\n         Franchisee  acknowledges  and agrees that Pretzel Time may, in its sole discretion,  collect  and  retain all  allowances,  benefits,  credits,  monies, payments  or  rebates   (collectively   \"Promotional   Rebates\"),   whether  for promotional,  advertising  or other  purposes,  offered to Franchisee or Pretzel Time or its Affiliates by manufacturers,  suppliers and distributors  based upon Franchisee's  purchases of Products or other products and materials.  Franchisee assigns to Pretzel  Time or its designee all of  Franchisee's  right,  title and interest  in and to any and  all  such  Promotional  Allowances  and  authorizes Pretzel  Time or its  designee to collect any such  Promotional  Allowances  for remission to the general operating funds of Pretzel Time.\n\n14.

A Unit  shall be under  the  direct,  on-premises  supervision  of a  trained  and competent  Franchisee  or a  trained  and  competent  employee  acting as a Unit Manager  at  all  times.  Franchisee  shall  remain  active  in  overseeing  the operations of the Unit  conducted  under the  supervision  of such Unit Manager. Pretzel  Time shall have the right to deal with the Unit  Manager and  assistant managers on matters  pertaining to the  day-to-day  operations of, and reporting requirements  for the Unit.  Franchisee shall be required to notify Pretzel Time within seven (7) business days of changing Unit Managers.  Franchisee shall hire all employees of the Unit and shall be exclusively  responsible for the terms of their  employment and compensation and for the proper training of such employees in the operation of the Unit.\n\n         If the Unit at any time is not being  managed by you or a Unit  Manager who shall have satisfactorily completed Pretzel Time's training program, Pretzel Time is  authorized,  but is not  required to  immediately  appoint a Manager to maintain  the  operations  of the Unit for you.  Pretzel  Time has the  right to change a reasonable fee for such management  services,  not to exceed our costs, and to cease to provide such  management  services at any time.  Pretzel  Time's right to manage a Unit and obtain  reimbursement  for costs also  applies in the event of your death or disability.\n\n         14.B.  SUFFICIENT WORKING CAPITAL.\n\n         Franchisee shall maintain an adequate sales force to serve properly all customers,  and shall  carry at all times a stock of  merchandise  of such size, character,  quality and price to produce the maximum return to Franchisee and so as to produce all of the gross  revenue  which may be produced by such manner of operation.\n\n         14.C.  FILING OF OPERATIONS AND SALES REPORTS.\n\n         Franchisee's  net revenues and operational  analysis are to be reported on or before Tuesday at 12:00 P.M.  Eastern  Standard Time (or Eastern  Daylight Savings  Time) or any other  time  reasonably  designated  by Pretzel  Time,  to Pretzel Time on forms  designated by Pretzel Time for the immediately  preceding week.  If the gross sales report is not submitted as herein  specified,  Pretzel Time may, at its option,  charge a late fee of $50.00 to Franchisee.  There will only be one late fee for each late report.\n\n         14.D.    EMPLOYEE DRESS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE.\n\n         The  presentation  of an uniform  image is  essential  to a  successful franchise  system.  Franchisee  shall cause all  employees of  Franchisee  while working  at the  franchise  location  to dress  appropriately  (in the  specific uniform  approved and  designated  by Pretzel  Time) in keeping with the Pretzel Time image,  as Pretzel Time may designate  from time to time, to present a neat and clean  appearance  and to render  confident  and  courteous  service  to the Franchise's customers.\n\n         14.E.  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND GOOD BUSINESS PRACTICES.\n\n         Franchisee  shall secure and maintain in force in his name all required licenses,  permits,  and  certificates  relating to the conduct of his  business pursuant to this  Agreement.  Franchisee  will  conduct the  Franchise in strict compliance  with  all  applicable  laws,  ordinances,   regulations,  and  other requirements  of any federal,  state,  county,  municipal  or other  government, including,   without  limitation,  those  laws  and  regulations  pertaining  to preparation,  purchase  and  handling of food  products,  occupational  hazards,\n\n\n\n\n\nhealth,  safety and sanitation,  worker's compensation  insurance,  unemployment insurance,  and  withholding  and payment of all taxes.  While  Pretzel Time may advise  Franchisee  as  a  courtesy  on  any  applicable  laws,  ordinances,  or regulations,  Pretzel Time  undertakes  no duty to do so and  Franchisee  hereby acknowledges  it is Franchisee's  sole duty to inquire  regarding and concerning all laws,  ordinances,  and  regulations  affecting  the Unit,  its  operations, employees and Franchisee.\n\n         Franchisee shall in all dealings with its customers, suppliers, Pretzel Time, and public officials adhere to high standards of honesty,  integrity, fair dealing and ethical conduct.  Franchisee  agrees to refrain from any business or advertising  practice which may be injurious to the business of Pretzel Time and the goodwill associated with the Marks and other Pretzel Time Units.\n\n         Franchisee  shall notify  Pretzel  Time within three (3) business  days after the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding or issuance of any order, writ, injunction, award or court decree which may adversely affect the operation or financial  condition of Franchisee or the unit or immediately  notify Pretzel Time of any notice of health or sanitation violation.\n\n         14.F.    PAYMENT OF TAXES.\n\n         Franchisee  shall be  solely  responsible  for  payment  of all  taxes, including, but not limited to, real estate, sales, payroll,  franchise,  income, personal  property,  and gross  receipts taxes which are assessed as a result of Franchisee's operation of the Franchise.\n\n         14.G.    SALE OF PRODUCT.\n\n         Franchisee agrees not to sell or offer to sell any materials, supplies, or  inventory  used in the  preparation  of any of the  Products  other  than to Pretzel  Time and that he shall  not  sell,  dispense,  give  away or  otherwise provide without Pretzel Time's prior written consent any product except by means of retail sales in the  franchise  location.  Franchisee  may only sell finished Products  and may not sell any Products to any person or entity  purchasing  the Products for resale.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  Franchisee may offer free samples of  Products  at or  directly  in front of the Unit to retail  customers only.\n\n         14.H.    COOPERATION.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees that he shall  cooperate with Pretzel Time in taking any action, or refraining from any action, which in the judgment of Pretzel Time is  necessary or desirable to promote and enhance the quality of the products of the Franchise location, the service provided by the Franchisee,  or the image of the Franchise in the community.\n\n         14.I.    INSURANCE.\n\n         Franchisee shall maintain at Franchisee's expense, in form, amounts and with insurers  satisfactory  to Pretzel Time,  which  insurers must have an A.M. Best  Company  rating of \"A-\" or better and naming  Pretzel  Time an  additional insured,  insurance  against all types of public  liability with personal injury coverage and property damage coverage. In addition to coverage as aforesaid such insurance  shall  include  coverages as set forth in the  Operations  Manual and shall contain a provision  obligating  all insurers to provide a written  notice Pretzel Time of any  cancellation  or  modification  of coverage at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such modification or cancellation.\n\n         The insurance afforded by the policy or policies  respecting  liability shall  not be  limited  in any  way by  reason  of any  insurance  which  may be maintained  by  Pretzel  Time.  Within  sixty  (60) days of the  signing of this Agreement,  but in no event later than the date on which Franchisee  acquires an interest in the real  property  (by lease or  purchase) on which it will develop and operate the Franchise,  a Certificate of Insurance  showing  compliance with the foregoing  requirements shall be furnished by Franchisee to Pretzel Time for approval.  Such certificate shall state that said policy or policies will not be canceled or altered  without at least thirty (30) days prior  written  notice to Pretzel Time and shall reflect proof of payment of premiums. Maintenance of such insurance  and the  performance  by  Franchisee  of the  obligations  under this Section shall not relieve Franchisee of liability under the indemnity  provision set forth in this  Agreement.  Minimum  limits as required above may be modified from time to time, as conditions require by written notice to Franchisee.\n\n         Should  Franchisee not procure and maintain such insurance  coverage as required  by Pretzel  Time,  Pretzel  Time  shall have the right and  authority, without any obligation to do so, immediately procure such insurance coverage and to charge same to Franchisee,  which charges  together with a reasonable fee for expenses incurred by Pretzel Time in connection with such procurement,  shall be payable by Franchisee immediately upon notice.\n\n         Franchisee  shall fully  cooperate  with Pretzel Time in its efforts to obtain  such  insurance  policies,  promptly  execute  all forms or  instruments required to obtain or maintain such insurance policies, allow inspections of the Unit or vehicles  which are  required to obtain and maintain  insurance  and pay Pretzel Time on demand for any costs or premiums.\n\n         14.J.    SUGGESTED RETAIL PRICES.\n\n         Pretzel  Time  may  from  time to time  advise  or  offer  guidance  to Franchisee  relative to prices for Products  offered for sale by Franchisee that in Pretzel Time's judgment  constitute good business practice.  Franchisee shall not be  obligated  to accept any such advice or guidance and shall have the sole right  to  determine  and to sell  products  at any  price  that it  determines.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhenever Pretzel Time recommends a retail price, such  recommendations are based on Pretzel  Time's  experience  concerning  all factors that enter into a proper price, but such recommendation is in no manner binding on Franchisee and no such advice or guidance  shall be deemed or construed to impose upon  Franchisee  any obligation  to charge any  fixed,  minimum  or  maximum  prices for any  product offered for sale by the Franchise.  Pretzel Time reserves the right to advertise retail  prices of Pretzel Time  Products,  provided  that such retail prices are qualified as \"suggested.\" The parties understand and agree that such advertising shall not be  construed  as  requiring  Franchisee  to adhere to such prices but Franchisee shall have complete freedom to establish retail prices.\n\n15.      ACCOUNTING, REPORTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\n\n         15.A.  ESTABLISHMENT OF ACCOUNTING SYSTEM.\n\n         Franchisee  shall  establish at his own expense a complete and accurate bookkeeping,  accounting,  record keeping and data processing system prepared in accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles and conforming to the requirements and formats that Pretzel Time prescribes from time to time. Pretzel Time shall provide  Franchisee with forms on which to maintain certain sales and operational  data.  Franchisee  shall furnish to Pretzel Time on said forms that Pretzel Time prescribes from time to time:\n\n         (i) On Tuesday of each week,  a report on the Unit's net  revenues  and          sales and operations for the previous week;\n\n         (ii) Every six calendar month period,  a balance sheet and a profit and          loss statement for the Unit for the previous  semi-annual  period and a          year to-date  statement  of  financial  condition as of the end of such          previous period; and\n\n         (iii) Within  thirty (30) days after  Franchisee's  year end, an annual financial report.\n\nThe reports  required in Section 15.A. (ii) and (iii) if not audited,  should be signed  by the  Franchisee  or its  financial  officer,  attesting  that (1) the reports are true and accurate,  (2) they are prepared in accordance with GAPP on a basis  consistent  with prior periods,  (3) they fully describe and completely disclose the information sought, and (4) the signer has made diligent efforts to ascertain the truth and completeness of the information.\n\n         15.B.   MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees, at all times, he shall keep and maintain  adequate, accurate,  true, and proper records, books, reports, data, and accounts relative to the  franchise  in the English  language  and in  accordance  with  generally accepted accounting principles, and retain the records for a period of three (3) years  after  the date they  were  prepared,  from  which  there may be  readily determined the  information  required in the operating  reports to be filed with Pretzel Time. Such records include, without limitation, daily cash reports, cash receipts  journal  and general  ledger,  cash  disbursements  journal and weekly payroll register,  monthly bank statements and daily deposit slips and cancelled checks;  tax returns,  supplier  invoices,  dated cash  register  tapes,  weekly inventories, sales reports, financial statements and tax returns.\n\n         Franchisee hereby authorizes  Pretzel Time to utilize the data supplied by  Franchisee  under this  Section  in any  publication,  discovery  statement, Offering  Circular,  or  advertisements  related  to the sale of  Franchises  or related  entities  by Pretzel  Time,  anywhere,  at any time,  without  specific compensation therefor.\n\n16.      AUDITS AND INSPECTIONS.\n\n         16.A.    AUDITS.\n\n         Pretzel  Time or its  designee  shall have the right at any time during business  hours and without prior notice to  Franchisee,  to inspect,  audit and copy or the right to cause to be  inspected,  audited and copied,  the  business records,  bookkeeping and accounting  records,  sales and income tax records and returns and other records of the Franchised Business,  including but not limited to,  daily  cash  reports,  cash  receipts  journal  and  general  ledger,  cash disbursements  journal and weekly payroll register,  monthly bank statements and daily deposit slips and cancelled checks; tax returns,  supplier invoices, dated cash register tapes, weekly inventories, sales reports, financial statements and tax returns and the books and records of any  corporation or  partnership  which holds the Franchise  including the personal financial records and tax returns of the Franchisee during and after the term of the Franchise Agreement.  Franchisee agrees to maintain on the premises  all sales and  operational  information  for four weeks.\n\n         Any such  inspection  or audit will take place at a time which will not interfere with  Franchisee's  normal business.  Franchisee shall fully cooperate with Pretzel Time's representatives and independent accountants hired by Pretzel Time to conduct any such inspection or audit.  If Pretzel Time deems  necessary, Franchisee shall deliver to Pretzel Time or its designated  agents copies of all bookkeeping  records not already in the  possession of Pretzel  Time,  including customer  records,  cash  register  tapes,  sales and  purchase  records and tax records,  to enable Pretzel Time or its representative or designee to adequately audit Franchisee's  gross sales.  Franchisee hereby waives any right to withhold tax records relative to the Franchise as privileged information. Each report and\n\n\n\n\n\nfinancial  statement  shall be signed and verified by  Franchisee  in the manner Pretzel Time prescribes.  Pretzel Time reserves the right to require  Franchisee to have audited or reviewed financial statements prepared on an annual basis.\n\n         In the event  that an audit  discloses  that  Franchisee's  actual  net revenues exceed  Franchisee's  reported net revenues by two percent (2%) or more for any thirty day  period,  Franchisee  is  obligated  to pay to Pretzel  Time, within  fifteen (15) days after receipt of the  inspection or audit report,  the royalty of seven percent (7%) and the  Advertising  Fund Fee of one percent (1%) of the amount of such  understatement  plus interest from the date such payments were originally due. The audit will be conducted at the expense of Pretzel Time, provided that if an audit  disclosed an  understatement  of two percent (2%), as described above,  Franchisee will bear the cost of the audit,  including without limitation,  the charges of attorneys  and any  independent  accountants,  their travel   expenses,   room  and  board,   and   compensation  of  Pretzel  Time's representatives  and  independent  accountants.  Providing  that in no case will Franchisee be obligated to pay more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for such inspection  or audit  costs.  The  foregoing  remedies  shall be in  addition to Pretzel Time's other remedies and rights under this Agreement or applicable law.\n\n         16.B.    RIGHT OF ENTRY AND INSPECTION.\n\n         To determine  whether  Franchisee  and the Unit are complying with this Agreement and with all Pretzel Time's  standards and operations as prescribed by Pretzel Time,  Pretzel Time or its designated agents shall have the right at any reasonable time and without prior notice to Franchisee to:\n\n         a.  Inspect the Unit;\n\n         b. Observe,  photograph  and video tape the Unit's  operations for such          consecutive or intermittent periods as Pretzel Time deems necessary;\n\n         c. Remove  samples of any  Products,  materials or supplies for testing and analysis;\n\n         d.  Interview personnel of the Unit;\n\n         e.  Interview customers of the Unit; and\n\n         f. Inspect and copy any books,  records and  documents  relating to the          operation  of the Unit.  Franchisee  agrees  to  cooperate  fully  with          Pretzel Time in connection with any such inspections, observations,  photographing,  video  taping,  Product  removal and  interviews. Franchisee  shall present to his customers  such comment or evaluation  forms as Pretzel Time periodically  prescribes and shall  participate  and/or request his customers  to  participate  in any surveys  performed by or on behalf of Pretzel Time. At the conclusion of his inspection,  Pretzel Time's field  representative shall prepare a written report which shall contain all of his  observations  and conclusions.  If the field representative  determines that a condition amounting to a default of this Agreement has occurred or exists,  this conclusion shall be promptly communicated to Franchisee and Pretzel Time.\n\n17.      TRANSFER, ASSIGNMENT AND REPURCHASE.\n\n         17.A.  BY PRETZEL TIME.\n\n         This Agreement is fully transferable by Pretzel Time and shall inure to the benefit of any  assignee,  transferee  or other legal  successor  to Pretzel Time's interest  herein.  If Pretzel Time's assignee will perform any of Pretzel Time's obligations under this Agreement,  then that assignee must be financially capable of performing  those  obligations and the assignee must expressly assume and agree to perform  them.  Franchisee  agrees that Pretzel Time shall have the right,  from time to time, to delegate the  performance of any portion or all of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.\n\n         17.B.  BY FRANCHISEE.\n\n         Franchisee  understands  and  acknowledges  that the  rights and duties created by this Franchise Agreement are personal to Franchisee (or if Franchisee is a  corporation  or  partnership,  to its  Owners) and that  Pretzel  Time has granted the Franchise to Franchisee in reliance upon Pretzel Time's  perceptions of the individual or collective character,  skill, aptitude,  attitude, business ability and  financial  capacity of  Franchisee  (or its  Owners).  Accordingly, Franchisee agrees no Transfer shall be made without Pretzel Time's prior written approval.  Any Transfer  without such approval shall constitute a breach of this Agreement  and shall be void and of no  effect.  Pretzel  Time's  consent to the assignment  shall  neither  constitute  a  novation  or change  in  Franchisee's obligations under this agreement,  nor constitute a waiver of any claims Pretzel Time may have  against  Franchisee  (or its  Owners)  nor be  deemed a waiver of Pretzel Time's right to demand the transferee's exact compliance with all of the terms or conditions of this Agreement.\n\n         17.C.

provided,  however, that Pretzel Time's approval          of such Transfer does not ensure the transferee's  success as a Pretzel          Time Unit  franchisee,  nor should  the  transferee  rely upon  Pretzel          Time's  approval  of such  Transfer in  determining  whether to acquire          Franchisee's  Pretzel Time Unit;

TRANSFER TO A WHOLLY-OWNED CORPORATION.\n\n         Notwithstanding Section 17.B., if Franchisee is in full compliance with this  Agreement,  Franchisee may transfer this Agreement to a corporation  which conducts no business  other than the Pretzel  Time Unit and in which  Franchisee maintains management control and owns and controls one hundred percent (100%) of the equity  and  voting  power of all  issued  and  outstanding  capital  stock. Transfers of shares of such  corporation  will be subject to the  provisions  of Section 17.C.(2) and 17.C.(8).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Franchisee  shall  remain  personally  liable  under  this  Agreement  as if the Transfer to such  corporation had not occurred.  The articles of  incorporation, by-laws and other organizational documents of such corporation shall recite that the issuance and  assignment of any interest  therein is restricted by the terms of Section 17 of this Franchise Agreement,  and all issued and outstanding stock certificates  of such  corporation  shall bear a legend reciting or referring to the restrictions hereof.\n\n         17.E.  FORMATION OF A CORPORATION.\n\n\n\n\n\n         In the event,  Franchisee  desires to form a  corporation  for the sole purpose of acting as a  Franchisee  under this  Agreement,  in  addition  to the conditions  imposed under Section 17, the following terms and conditions must be complied with, unless otherwise agreed in writing by Pretzel Time:\n\n                  (1) Franchisee  must be the owner of the majority  interest in                   the  voting  stock  of  the   corporation  and  the  principal                   executive officer thereof;\n\n                  (2)  Franchisee's  shareholders  shall enter into an agreement                   under seal with Pretzel Time, on Pretzel Time's standard form,                   guaranteeing  the  full  payment  of the  corporation's  money                   obligations to Pretzel Time as individual  surety and agreeing                   to be bound  individually  by the  non-competition  obligation                   stated herein; and\n\n                  (3) Franchisee and all shareholders  must continue to meet its                   obligations  under  the  noncompetition   provisions  of  this                   Agreement.\n\n         In  the  event   Franchisee  or  its  successor  is  a  corporation  or partnership or similar entity, it is agreed as follows:\n\n                  (1) That the  Articles  of  Incorporation  and  By-Laws or the                   Partnership  Agreement,  shall  reflect  that the issuance and                   transfer of voting stock or other ownership  interest therein,                   is restricted by the terms of this Agreement. Franchisee shall                   furnish  Pretzel  Time at the  time of the  execution  of this                   Agreement or of assignment to the  corporation  or partners of                   Franchisee, a written agreement stating that no stockholder or                   partner  will  sell,  assign  or  transfer  voluntarily  or by                   operation  of law  any  securities  of  Franchisee,  or  other                   ownership  interest  in  Franchisee,  to any  person or entity                   other than existing shareholders or partnership, to the extent                   permitted  hereunder,  without  the prior  written  consent of                   Pretzel Time.  All securities  issued by Franchisee  will bear                   the  following  legend  which  shall be  printed  legibly  and                   conspicuously  on each stock  certificate or other evidence of                   Ownership Interest:\n\n                    \"The  transfer of these  securities  is subject to the terms                     and  conditions of a Franchise  Agreement with Pretzel Time,                     Inc.  dated , 199____.  Reference is made to said  Agreement                     and to  the  restrictive  provisions  of  the  Articles  and                     By-laws or Shareholders or Partnership Agreement.\"\n\n                  (2) That if Franchisee or a successor,  is a corporation,  the                   majority of the capital stock thereof shall not at any time or                   in the  aggregate  be sold,  assigned,  pledged,  mortgaged or                   transferred without the prior written consent of Pretzel Time.\n\n                  (3) Franchisee  represents and warrants that its Owners are as                   set  forth  on  Exhibit  B  attached  to  this  Agreement  and                   covenants that it will not vary from that ownership  structure                   without the prior written approval of Pretzel Time.\n\n         17.F.  DEATH OR DISABILITY OF FRANCHISEE.\n\n         Upon the death or Permanent  Disability of Franchisee or, if Franchisee is a  corporation  or  partnership,  the  Owner  of a  Controlling  Interest  in Franchisee, the executor, administrator, conservator, guardian or other personal representative  of such  person  shall  transfer  Franchisee's  interest in this Agreement or such interest in  Franchisee  to a third party  approved by Pretzel Time.  Such  disposition  of this  Agreement  or  such  interest  in  Franchisee (including,  without  limitation,  transfer by bequest or inheritance)  shall be completed  within a reasonable  time, not to exceed six (6) months from the date of death or  Permanent  Disability,  and shall be  subject  to all the terms and conditions  applicable to Transfers contained in Section 17.B. and 17.C. Failure to transfer the interest in this Agreement or such interest in Franchisee within said period of time shall constitute a breach of this Agreement.\n\n         17.G.    PRETZEL TIME'S FIRST RIGHT OF REFUSAL.\n\n          If  Franchisee  (or its Owners)  shall at any time  determine to sell, assign or transfer for consideration  this Agreement or an Ownership Interest in Franchisee  or the Unit,  Franchisee  (or its Owners)  shall obtain a bona fide, executed  written offer and earnest  money deposit from a responsible  and fully disclosed purchaser (including lists of the Owners of record and beneficially of any corporate  offeror and all general and limited  partners of any  partnership offeror and, in the case of a publicly-held  corporation or limited partnership, copies of the most current annual and quarterly  reports) and shall  immediately submit to Pretzel  Time a true and  complete  copy of such  offer,  which  shall include  details of the payment  terms of the proposed  sale and the sources and terms of any financing for the proposed purchase price. To be a valid, bona fide offer, the proposed purchase price shall be denominated in a dollar amount.  The offer must apply only to an interest in this  Agreement,  Franchisee or the Unit and may not  include  an offer to  purchase  any  other  property  or  rights of Franchisee (or its Owners).  However,  if the offeror  proposes to buy any other property  or  rights  from   Franchisee   (or  its  Owners)  under  a  separate, contemporaneous offer, the price and terms of purchase offered to Franchisee (or its Owners) for the  interest in this  Agreement,  Franchisee  or the Unit shall reflect the bona fide price  offered  therefore  and shall not reflect any value for any other property or rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n          Pretzel  Time  shall  have the right,  exercisable  by written  notice delivered to Franchisee  (or its Owners) within sixty (60) days from the date of delivery  of an exact copy of such  offer to  Pretzel  Time,  to  purchase  such interest for the price and on the terms and conditions  contained in such offer, provided that Pretzel Time may substitute cash for any form of payment  proposed in such offer,  Pretzel Time's credit shall be deemed equal to the credit of any proposed  purchaser and Pretzel Time shall have not less than sixty (60) days to prepare  for  closing.  Without  regard to the  representations  and  warranties demanded by the proposed  purchaser,  if any,  Pretzel Time shall be entitled to purchase such interest subject to all customary  representations  and warranties given by the  Franchisee,  seller of the assets of a business or voting stock of an  incorporated  business,  as  applicable,   including,   without  limitation, representations  and  warranties as to ownership,  condition and title to stock, and /or assets,  liens and  encumbrances  relating to the stock  and/or  assets, validity  of  contracts  and  liabilities  of the  corporation  whose  stock  is purchased and affecting the assets, contingent or otherwise.\n\n         If Pretzel Time exercises its right of first refusal,  Franchisee  (and its Owners)  agrees that,  for a period of twelve (12) months  commencing on the date of the closing,  neither  Franchisee (nor its Owners) shall have any direct or indirect interest  (through a member of the immediate  families of Franchisee or its Owners of  otherwise)  as a  disclosed  or  beneficial  owner,  investor, partner, director, officer, employee, consultant, representative, or agent or in any other capacity in any Competitive Business located or operating within three (3) miles of the Unit,  and/or  three (3) miles of any other  Pretzel Time Unit. The  restrictions  of this Section  shall not be  applicable to the ownership of shares  of a class of  securities  listed on a stock  exchange  or traded on the over-the-counter market that represent two percent (2%) or less of the number of shares of that class of  securities  issued  and  outstanding.  If Pretzel  Time exercises its right of first refusal, Franchisee (and its Owners) further agrees that he will abide by the restrictions of Section 17.C.(13).\n\n          If  Pretzel  Time  does not  exercise  its  right  of  first  refusal, Franchisee or its Owners may complete the sale to such purchaser pursuant to and on the exact  terms of such  offer,  subject to Pretzel  Time's  approval of the Transfer as provided in Section 17,  provided that if the sale to such purchaser is not completed  within 120 days after  delivery of such offer to Pretzel Time, or if there is a  material  change  in the terms of the sale  (which  Franchisee shall  promptly  communicate  to Pretzel  Time),  Pretzel  Time's right to first refusal shall be extended for thirty (30) days after the  expiration of such 120 day period or after the material change in the terms of the sale so communicated to Pretzel Time.\n\n         17.H.    PUBLIC OR PRIVATE OFFERINGS.\n\n         In the event  Franchisee (or any of its Owners)  shall,  subject to the restrictions  and  conditions  of Transfer  contained in Section 17,  attempt to raise or secure funds by the sale of securities (including,  without limitation, common or preferred stock,  bonds,  debentures or general or limited partnership interests) in Franchisee or any affiliate of Franchisee, Franchisee, recognizing that the written information may reflect upon Pretzel Time, agrees to submit any such written information used with respect thereto prior to its inclusion in any registration  statement,  prospectus or similar offering  circular or memorandum and to obtain Pretzel Time's written consent to the method of financing prior to any offering or sale of such securities. Pretzel Time's written consent pursuant to this Section  shall not imply or  constitute  Pretzel  Time's  approval  with respect to the sale of the  securities,  the  offering  literature  submitted to Pretzel  Time or any other aspect of the  offering.  No  information  respecting Pretzel  Time  shall  be  included  in  any  disclosure   document  unless  such information  has  been  furnished  by  Pretzel  Time  in  writing   pursuant  to Franchisee's  written request,  in which Franchisee states the specific purposes for  which the  information  is to be used.  Should  Pretzel  Time,  in its sole discretion, object to any reference to it or its business or to the relationship of  Franchisee  or  a  controlled  affiliate  in  such  offering  literature  or prospectus,  such  literature or  prospectus  shall not be used unless and until Pretzel Time's objections are withdrawn.  Pretzel Time assumes no responsibility whatsoever for any offering.  Franchisee  shall pay Pretzel  Time's  expenses in connection with the offering or proposed offering.\n\n         The prospectus or other literature  utilized in any such offering shall contain the  following  language in  bold-face  type on the first  textual  page thereof:\n\n         PRETZEL  TIME,  INC. IS NOT  DIRECTLY OR  INDIRECTLY  THE ISSUER OF THE          SECURITIES OFFERED HEREBY AND ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY WITH RESPECT TO          THIS OFFERING AND/OR THE SUFFICIENCY OR ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION SET          FORTH HEREIN,  INCLUDING ANY  STATEMENTS  WITH RESPECT TO PRETZEL TIME,          INC.  PRETZEL TIME,  INC.  DOES NOT ENDORSE OR MAKE ANY  RECOMMENDATION          WITH RESPECT TO THE INVESTMENT CONTEMPLATED BY THIS OFFERING.\n\n         Franchisee  (and each of its Owners)  agrees to  indemnify,  defend and hold harmless Pretzel Time, its parent company, subsidiaries, and Affiliates and their officers, directors, employees and agents from any and all claims, demands and  liabilities,  and all costs and expenses  (including,  without  limitation, reasonable  attorneys' fees) incurred in defending against such claims,  demands or  liabilities,  arising  from the  offer or sale of such  securities,  whether asserted  by a  purchaser  of any such  security  or by a  governmental  agency. Pretzel  Time shall have the right (but not the  obligation)  to defend any such claims,  demands or  liabilities  and/or to  participate  in the  defense of any action to which it is named as a party.\n\n18.      TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT BY FRANCHISEE.\n\n\n\n\n\n         18.A.  FRANCHISEE'S RIGHT TO TERMINATE.\n\n         If  Franchisee is in  substantial  compliance  with this  Agreement and Pretzel Time  substantially  breaches a material provision of this Agreement and (1) fails to cure such  breach  within  thirty  (30) days after  written  notice thereof is delivered to Pretzel Time or (2) if such breach cannot  reasonably be cured  within  thirty (30) days after  Pretzel  Time's  receipt of such  notice, undertake  (within  thirty (30) days after Pretzel Time's receipt of such notice and  continue  until  completion),  reasonable  efforts  to  cure  such  breach, Franchisee may terminate this Agreement. Such termination shall be effective ten (10) days after delivery to Pretzel Time of notice that such breach has not been cured and Franchisee  elects to terminate this Agreement.  A termination of this Agreement  by  Franchisee  for any reason other than a  substantial  breach of a material provision of this Agreement by Pretzel Time, and Pretzel Time's failure to cure  such  breach  as  provided  above  shall  be  deemed a  termination  by Franchisee without cause.\n\n19.      DEFAULT AND TERMINATION.\n\n         19.A.  EXACT AND COMPLETE PERFORMANCE REQUIRED.\n\n         Franchisee  acknowledges that complete  performance of all the terms of this  Agreement  is  necessary  for  the  protection  of  Pretzel  Time  and its franchisees.  It is therefore agreed that complete and exact  performance by the Franchisee  of each of his  promises  contained  herein  is a  condition  to the continuance of this Franchise.\n\n         19.B.    DEFAULT AND RIGHT TO CURE.\n\n         If Franchisee  defaults in the  performance of any of the terms of this Agreement  or the  Operations  Manual,  Pretzel  Time,  in addition to all other remedies  available to it at law or in equity and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies,  may  immediately  terminate  this Agreement by delivering a written notice to Franchisee of any breach of this Agreement and a notice period of  forty-five  (45) days shall be given to  Franchisee,  unless such default is cured by the  Franchisee  within thirty (30) days after written  notice  thereof from Pretzel Time to Franchisee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  if the default is other  than a failure to pay a monetary  obligation  to Pretzel  Time or to a related  company and of a nature that more than thirty (30) days are  reasonably required to cure,  Franchisee  shall  commence  to cure the default  within said thirty (30) day period and shall proceed with such cure with due diligence  with a view to accomplishing the cure at the earliest possible moment, and within the period,  if any,  designated  by Pretzel Time as the allowable  additional  time within which the cure must be accomplished.\n\n         19.C.  EXTENSION OF NOTICE.\n\n         If any  applicable  law or rule  requires  a  greater  prior  notice of termination,  the prior notice required by such law or rule shall be substituted for the notice requirements herein.\n\n         19.D.  REPEATED BREACHES.\n\n         Further,   notwithstanding  anything  herein  elsewhere  contained,  if Franchisee shall repeatedly fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement,  or any of them,  of any nature,  even though such  failures may be cured within the applicable  grace  periods,  Pretzel Time shall have the right by written notice given to Franchisee  immediately  to declare this  Agreement  terminated,  which right shall be in addition to and without prejudice to any other right or remedy to which Pretzel Time may be entitled  under this  Agreement or otherwise  under applicable law. As used in this Agreement the term \"repeatedly  fail\" shall mean three (3) defaults within any twelve (12) month period, even if the defaults are later cured.          19.E.    EVENTS OF DEFAULT - 30 DAYS NOTICE - CURABLE DEFAULTS.\n\n         The  occurrence of any one of the following  events shall  constitute a default under this Agreement  requiring a 30 day notice period of termination by Pretzel Time to Franchisee:\n\n                  (i) Franchisee  fails to pay money when due to Pretzel Time as                   required  under the Franchise  Agreement,  including,  without                   limitation,  the franchise  fee, the renewal fee, the transfer                   fee, royalties, and the advertising fund fee;

or\n\n                  (iii) If Franchisee  fails to submit to Pretzel Time financial                   or other  information  when required  under this  Agreement or                   submits a financial statement which materially understates net                   revenues; or\n\n                  (iv) If  Franchisee  fails to develop or construct the Unit in                   accordance  with  this  Agreement;  Pretzel  Time's  plans and                   specifications  or fails to equip and furnish the  location in                   accordance with Pretzel Time's plans and specifications;

Further,  Franchisee shall discontinue  the use of any and all printed goods and materials using said trade names,  trademarks,  logos and other  commercial  symbols  of Pretzel  Time.

TELEPHONE COMPANY.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees to notify the  telephone  company and all  telephone directory  publishers of the termination or expiration of Franchisee's  right to use any  telephone  and telecopy  numbers and any regular,  classified  or other telephone  directory  listings  associated  with any Mark and to  authorize  the transfer  thereof to Pretzel Time or at its direction.  Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees  that as between  him and  Pretzel  Time,  Pretzel  Time has the sole rights to and  interest in all  telephone  and  telecopy  numbers and  directory listings  associated  with any Mark.  Franchisee  authorizes  Pretzel Time,  and hereby appoints Pretzel Time and any of its officers as Franchisee's attorney in fact, to direct the telephone company and all telephone directory  publishers to transfer any telephone and telecopy numbers and directory  listings  relating to the Pretzel Time Units to Pretzel Time or at its  direction,  should  Franchisee fail or refuse to do so, and the telephone  company and all telephone  directory publishers  may accept such direction or this agreement as conclusive of Pretzel Time's  exclusive  rights in such  telephone and telecopy  numbers and directory listings  and Pretzel  Time's  authority to direct  their  transfer.  Franchisee agrees to execute a  collateral  assignment  of  telephone  numbers and listings agreement  which is attached hereto as Exhibit G. In no event shall Pretzel Time be responsible  for any charges  incurred by Franchisee and associated  with the telephone company prior to the date of transfer.\n\n         20.E.    CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\n\n         Franchisee (and its Owners) agrees that upon  termination or expiration of this Agreement, he will immediately cease to use any Confidential Information of Pretzel Time or its Affiliates disclosed to him pursuant to this Agreement in any business or otherwise.  This  provision is also  applicable to the Owners if the Franchise is a corporation or partnership.\n\n         20.F.    LEASING.\n\n         If Franchisee  has leased the  premises,  Pretzel Time may, in its sole discretion  and without any  obligation to do so,  assume the lease.  Franchisee will not be entitled to any refund of the initial franchise fee,  royalties,  or Advertising Fund Fees.\n\n         20.G.    COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE.\n\n         Upon  termination of this  Agreement,  in accordance with its terms and conditions or by Franchisee  without cause, or upon expiration of this Agreement (unless the Franchise is renewed as provided for in this Agreement),  Franchisee and its Owners agree that for a period of TWELVE (12) months  commencing  on the effective  date of  termination  or expiration  or the date on which  Franchisee complies  with this Section,  whichever is later,  neither  Franchisee,  nor its Owners,  nor any person or entity  affiliated  with  Franchisee or  Franchisee's shareholders or partners shall have any direct or indirect  interest  (through a member of the immediate  families of Franchisee or its Owners or otherwise) as a disclosed or beneficial owner, investor,  partner, director,  officer, employee, consultant,  representative,  agent or in any other capacity in any  Competitive Business  located or operating:  (1) at the Site;  (2) within three (3) miles of the Unit;  and/or (3) within  three (3) miles of any other  Pretzel Time Unit in operation  or  under  development  on  the  effective  date  of  termination  or expiration of this  agreement for a period of one year after the  termination or expiration.

Franchisee  and its Owners  expressly  acknowledge  that they possess skills and abilities of a general nature and have other  opportunities  for exploiting such skills. Consequently, enforcement of the covenants made in this Section will not deprive the Franchisee or its Owners or shareholders of their personal  goodwill or ability to earn a living.\n\nThe Franchise  Agreement contains a covenant not to compete which extends beyond\n\n\n\n\n\nthe termination of the franchise. Franchisee and its Owners acknowledge that the covenant  not to compete is fair and  reasonable,  and will not impose any undue hardship,  since the Franchisee (and its Owners) has other considerable  skills, experience and education  which will afford him the opportunity to derive income from other endeavors.\n\nNeither  Franchisee  nor any of its Owners shall divert or attempt to divert any business or any customers of any Pretzel Time Unit to any  Competitive  Business or employ or seek to employ any  person who is  employed  by Pretzel  Time,  its Affiliates  or a franchisee  of Pretzel Time nor induce or attempt to induce any such person to leave said  employment  without the prior written consent of such person's employer.\n\n         20.H.  PRETZEL TIME'S RIGHT TO PURCHASE ASSETS OF THE UNIT.\n\n         Upon  termination of this Agreement by Pretzel Time in accordance  with its terms and  conditions or by Franchisee  without cause or upon  expiration of this  Agreement  (unless the franchise  has been  renewed),  Pretzel  Time,  its Affiliates  or  its  assignee  shall  have  the  option  (not  the  obligation), exercisable  by giving  written  notice  thereof within sixty (60) days from the date of such  expiration  or  termination,  to acquire from  Franchisee  all the assets  in the Unit  including  the  equipment,  furnishings,  signs,  leasehold improvements,  usable  inventory  of  Products,  materials,  supplies  and other tangible assets of the Unit and an assignment of the lease for the Unit. Pretzel Time  shall  have the  unrestricted  right to assign  this  option to  purchase. Pretzel Time or its assignee  shall be entitled to all customary  warranties and representations  in  connection  with its  asset  purchase,  including,  without limitation,  representations  and  warranties as to ownership,  condition of and title to assets, no liens and encumbrances on the assets,  validity of contracts and agreements and liabilities  inuring to Pretzel Time or affecting the assets, contingent or otherwise.\n\n         (1) The purchase price for the assets of the Unit shall be equal to the greater of:\n\n                  The sum of the book  value  of the  Unit's  assets  (including                   furnishings,  fixtures, equipment, and leasehold improvements)                   amortized on a straight-line basis over a five (5) year period                   plus the lesser of costs and the then-current wholesale market                   value of all  usable  inventory  of  Products,  materials  and                   supplies (i.e. in good and saleable condition and not obsolete                   or discontinued), or\n\n                  The  product of the Unit's  average  cash flow for the two (2)                   most recently  completed  fiscal years  multiplied by two (2).                   \"Cash  flow\"  represents  the  Unit's  net  revenues  less all                   pretzel  unit-related  costs (i.e., cost of goods sold, labor,                   occupancy   and  other  Unit   expenses)  as  well  as  annual                   administrative  costs of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) and                   royalty and  service  fees,  but not  including  interest  and                   depreciation.\n\n         (2)  Pretzel  Time and its  Affiliates  shall have the right to set off against and reduce the purchase  price by any and all amounts owed by Franchisee to Pretzel  Time and its  Affiliates.  Pretzel  Time may exclude from the assets purchased  hereunder any  equipment,  furnishings,  signs,  usable  inventory of Products,  materials  or supplies of the Unit that Pretzel Time has not approved as meeting its standards for Pretzel Time Unit,  and the purchase price shall be reduced by the  replacement  costs of such excluded  items which are required in the operation of the Unit.\n\n         (3) The  purchase  price  shall be paid in cash at the  closing  of the purchase, which shall take place no later than ninety (90) days after receipt by Franchisee  of Pretzel  Time's notice of exercise of this option to purchase the Unit, at which time Franchisee shall deliver instruments transferring to Pretzel Time or its assignee good and merchantable  title to the assets purchased,  free and clear of all liens and encumbrances  with all sales and other transfer taxes paid by  Franchisee,  and all  licenses  or  permits  of the Unit  which  may be assigned or transferred. In the event the closing of the purchase does not occur within said ninety (90) day period because Franchisee fails to act diligently in connection therewith,  the purchase price shall be reduced by ten percent (10%). Franchisee  further agrees that the purchase  price shall be further  reduced by ten percent (10%) per month for each subsequent  month  Franchisee  fails to act diligently to consummate this  transaction.  In the event that Franchisee cannot deliver clear title to all of the purchased assets as aforesaid, or in the event there are other unresolved  issues, at Pretzel Time's option,  the losing of the sale shall be accomplished through an escrow.  Prior to closing,  Franchisee and Pretzel  Time shall  comply with the  applicable  Bulk Sales  provisions  of the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in the state in which the Unit is located.\n\n         (4) If Pretzel Time or its assignee  exercises this option to purchase, pending  the  closing of such  purchase,  Pretzel  Time may appoint a manager to maintain the operation of the Unit, at its option,  require  Franchisee to close the Unit during such time period  without  removing any assets.  If Pretzel Time appoints a manager to maintain the operation of the Unit pending closing of such purchase, all funds from the Unit's operation during the period of management by a  Pretzel  Time  appointed  manager  shall be kept in a  separate  fund and all expenses of the Unit, including compensation,  other costs and travel and living expenses of the Pretzel Time appointed  manager,  shall be charged to such fund. As compensation for the management services provided,  Pretzel Time shall charge such fund ten  percent  (10%) of the  Unit's net  revenues  during the period of Pretzel Time's management. Operation of the Unit during any such period shall be for and on behalf of  Franchisee,  provided  that Pretzel Time shall have a duty only to utilize its good faith  efforts and shall not be liable to Franchisee or\n\n\n\n\n\nits Owners for any debts,  losses or obligations  incurred by the Unit or to any creditor  of  Franchisee  for any  merchandise  materials,  supplies  or service purchased by the Unit during any period in which it is managed by Pretzel Time's appointed  manager.  Franchisee  shall maintain in force all insurance  policies required for the Unit until the date of closing.\n\n21.      RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES/INDEMNIFICATION.\n\n         21.A.    EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIP.\n\n         Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that Pretzel Time would be unable to protect  Confidential  Information  against  unauthorized  use or disclosure and would be unable to  encourage  a free  exchange of ideas and  information  among Pretzel Time Units if  Franchisees  of Pretzel Time Units were permitted to hold interests in or perform services for a Competitive  Business except as specified in Exhibit C.  Franchisee  also  acknowledges  that Pretzel Time has granted the Franchise to  Franchisee  in  consideration  of and reliance  upon  Franchisee's agreement to deal  exclusively  with Pretzel Time.  Franchisee  therefore agrees that  during the term of the  Franchise  Agreement,  or the period of time which Franchisee operates a Unit under this Agreement,  whichever is shorter,  neither Franchisee  nor  any  Affiliate,  immediate  family  member,  or  in  the  event Franchisee is a corporation\n\nany Owner thereof and member of his immediate  family or in the event  Franchise is a partnership any partner  (general or limited) thereof and any member of his immediate family, shall:\n\n         (1) Have  any  direct  or  indirect  interest  as an  owner,  investor,          partner, director, officer, employee, consultant, representative, agent          or in  any  other  capacity  in any  Competitive  Business  located  or          operating  at the Site or within  three (3) miles of any  Pretzel  Time          Unit  in  operation  or  under  development  on the  effective  date of          termination or expiration of this Agreement, except a Pretzel Time Unit          operated by Franchisee under Franchise Agreements with Pretzel Time; or\n\n         (2) Recruit or hire any employee who, within the immediately  preceding          six (6) month period,  was employed by Pretzel Time or any Pretzel Time          Unit operated by Pretzel Time, its Affiliates or another  franchisee or          licensee  of  Pretzel  Time,   without   obtaining  the  prior  written          permission of Pretzel Time or such franchisee.\n\n         Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Franchisee shall not be prohibited from owning securities  listed on a stock exchange or traded on the  over-the-counter market that represents two percent (2%) or less of that class of securities.\n\n         Covenants contained in this Section shall be construed as severable and independent,   and  shall  be  interpreted  and  applied   consistent  with  the requirements  of  reasonableness.  Any judicial  reformation of these  covenants consistent  with this  interpretation  shall be enforceable as though  contained herein  and shall not affect any other  provisions  or terms of this  Agreement. This non-compete provision may not be enforceable under the laws of your state.\n\n         21.B.  NO LIABILITY FOR ACTS OF OTHER PARTY.\n\n         Franchisee shall not employ any of the Marks in signing any contract or applying  for any  franchise or permit or in a manner that may result in Pretzel Time's  liability for any of Franchisee's  indebtedness or obligations,  nor may Franchisee  use the Marks in any way not  expressly  authorized by Pretzel Time. Except as expressly  authorized in writing,  neither Pretzel Time nor Franchisee shall  make  any  express  or  implied  agreements,  warranties,  guarantees  or representations  or  incur  any  debt in the  name or on  behalf  of the  other, represent that their relationship is other than Pretzel Time and franchisee,  or be obligated by or have any liability  under any  agreements or  representations made by the other that are not  expressly  authorized  in writing.  Pretzel Time shall not be  obligated  for any damages to any person or  property  directly or indirectly  arising out of the  operation of the Unit or  Franchisee's  business authorized by or conducted pursuant to this Agreement.\n\n         21.C.    TAXES.\n\n         Pretzel  Time shall have no  liability  for any  sales,  use,  service, occupation,  excise,  gross receipts,  income,  property or other taxes, whether levied upon Franchisee, the Unit, Franchisee's property or upon Pretzel Time, in connection with the sales made or business  conducted by Franchisee.  Payment of all such taxes shall be Franchisee's responsibility.\n\n         21.D.    INDEMNIFICATION.\n\n         Franchisee   agrees  to  indemnify   and  hold  Pretzel  Time  and  its subsidiaries,  Affiliates, stockholders,  directors, officers, employees, agents and assignees harmless against, and to reimburse them for, any loss,  liability, judgment  or damages  (actual or  consequential)  and all  reasonable  costs and expenses of  defending  any claim  brought  against any of them or any action in which any of them is named as a party (including, without limitation, reasonable accountants,  attorneys' and expert witness fees, costs of investigation,  court costs, other litigation expenses,  damages to Pretzel Time's reputation and good will, travel expenses) which any of them may suffer,  sustain or incur by reason of, arising from or in connection  with  Franchisee's  ownership or operation of the Unit, unless such loss, liability or damage is only due to the negligence of Pretzel  Time  (or  its  Affiliates,  subsidiaries).  Pretzel  Time's  right  to indemnity  under  this  agreement  shall  arise  notwithstanding  that  joint or concurrent  liability  may be  imposed on Pretzel  Time by  statute,  ordinance, regulation or other law.  Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees that any action or inaction by any third party which is not an  Affiliate of Pretzel Time shall not\n\n\n\n\n\nbe attributable to or constitute negligence of Pretzel Time. The indemnities and assumptions of liabilities and  obligations  herein shall continue in full force and effect  subsequent to and  notwithstanding  the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n         Pretzel Time shall notify Franchisee of any claims and Franchisee shall be given the  opportunity  to assume the  defense of the matter.  If  Franchisee fails to assume the defense  within  three (3) days of notice  thereof,  Pretzel Time may defend the action in the manner reasonably appropriate,  and Franchisee shall pay to Pretzel Time all reasonable  costs,  including  without  limitation attorney's  fees,  court  costs,  expert  witness  fees,  travel  and  telephone expenses, incurred by Pretzel Time in effecting such defense, in addition to any such sum which Pretzel Time may pay by reason of any settlement agreed to by the parties or reasonably  negotiated by Pretzel Time in the event  Franchisee fails to assume the defense, or judgment against Pretzel Time.\n\n         21.E.  INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR.\n\n         It is understood and agreed by the parties hereto that Franchisee is an independent contractor and is not an agent, partner, joint venturer, or employee of  Pretzel  Time.  Pretzel  Time and  Franchisee  agree  that  nothing  in this Agreement  is  intended  to  create  a  fiduciary   relationship  between  them. Franchisee  shall have no right to bind or obligate  Pretzel Time in any way nor shall he  represent  that he has any right to do so.  Pretzel Time shall have no control over the terms and conditions of employment of Franchisee's employees.\n\n         In all public records and in his  relationship  with other persons,  on stationery, business forms and checks, Franchisee shall indicate his independent ownership of the  franchised  Unit and that he is a franchisee  of Pretzel Time. Franchisee  shall exhibit on the premises in such places as may be designated by Pretzel  Time,  a Pretzel  Time  approved  notice  that the  franchised  Unit is operated by an  independent  operator and not by Pretzel Time or Pretzel  Time's Affiliates,  which operate company owned  franchises.  Franchisee shall take all legal  steps  such as a  fictitious  name  registration  to ensure  Franchisee's independent business status.\n\n22.      PROTECTION OF TRADE SECRETS.\n\n         22.A.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\n\n         Pretzel Time  possesses  and will further  develop and acquire  certain confidential  and  proprietary  information  and trade  secrets  relating to the operation  of  Pretzel  Time  Units,  which  includes,  but not  limited  to the following  categories  of  information,  methods,  techniques,  procedures,  and knowledge  developed or to be  developed by Pretzel  Time,  its  consultants  or contractors,  its Affiliates or its designees, and/or franchisees (\"Confidential Information\"):\n\n         (1)  methods,   techniques,   equipment,   specifications,   standards,          policies, procedures, information, concepts and systems relating to and          knowledge  of  and  experience  in  the   development,   operation  and          franchising of Pretzel Time Units:\n\n         (2) site selection criteria;\n\n         (3) marketing and promotional programs for Pretzel Time Units;\n\n         (4) recipes, ingredients,  formulas, mixes, spices, seasonings, sauces,          recipes for, and methods for the preparation,  cooking,  and serving of          the Products;\n\n         (5)  techniques,  formats,  specifications,  systems,  procedures,  and          knowledge of and experience in the development and operation of Pretzel          Time Units;\n\n         (6) knowledge of specifications  for and suppliers of certain Products,          materials, supplies, equipment, furnishings and fixtures;\n\n         (7) sales data and information  concerning  inventory  requirements for          Products,  materials and supplies, and specifications for and knowledge          of suppliers of certain materials,  equipment, and fixtures for Pretzel          Time Units;\n\n         (8) employee selection procedures, training and staffing levels;\n\n         (9) Operations Manual and other Manuals prepared by Pretzel Time; and\n\n         (10) information concerning Product sales, operating results, financial          performance and other financial data of Pretzel Time Units.\n\n         Pretzel Time will disclose such parts of the  Confidential  Information as  Pretzel  Time deems  necessary  or  advisable  from time to time in its sole discretion  for the  operation  of a  Pretzel  Time  Unit to  Franchisee  during training, and in guidance and assistance furnished to Franchisee during the term of the Franchise, and Franchisee may learn or otherwise obtain from Pretzel Time additional  Confidential  Information  of  Pretzel  Time  during the term of the Franchise.  Franchisee acknowledges that the foregoing Confidential  Information is highly  confidential.  Franchisee  acknowledges  and agrees  that he will not acquire  any  interest  in  Confidential  Information,  other  than the right to utilize Confidential Information disclosed to Franchisee in the operation of the Pretzel  Time  Unit  during  the  term of this  Agreement,  and  that the use or duplication  of  any  Confidential  Information  in  any  other  business  would constitute an unfair method of competition. Franchisee, including its directors,\n\n\n\n\n\nofficers,  shareholders,  and partners agree(s) that Confidential Information is proprietary,  includes  trade  secrets  of  Pretzel  Time  and is  disclosed  to Franchisee solely on the condition that Franchisee  agrees,  and Franchisee (and its Owners) does hereby agree, that he:\n\n         (1) shall not disclose any  information  pertaining to the Pretzel Time          System,  directly or indirectly,  to any person,  natural or corporate,          without the express prior written  consent of Pretzel Time.  Franchisee          may disclose to its Unit Manager such  information  deemed necessary to          disclose,  provided  such Unit  Manager  has  agreed to  maintain  such          information in confidence in Pretzel Time's  confidentiality  agreement          and Pretzel Time has received such executed agreement  (attached hereto          as Exhibit H);\n\n         (2) Will not use  Confidential  Information  in any other  business  or capacity;\n\n         (3)  Will  maintain  the  absolute   confidentiality   of  Confidential          Information during and after the term of this Agreement;\n\n         (4) Will not make  unauthorized  copies of any portion of  Confidential          Information disclosed in written or other tangible form; and\n\n         (5) Will adopt and implement  all  reasonable  procedures  that Pretzel          Time  prescribes  from  time  to time to  prevent  unauthorized  use or          disclosure of Confidential Information,  including, without limitation,          restrictions on disclosure thereof to his employees.\n\n         This  confidentiality  requirement  shall  not apply in a  judicial  or administrative  proceeding  to the extent  Franchisee  is legally  compelled  to disclose such information,  provided Franchisee shall have used his best efforts and shall have afforded  Pretzel Time the  opportunity  to obtain an appropriate protective order or other assurance satisfactory to Pretzel Time of confidential treatment for the information required to be so disclosed.  This restrictions on Franchisee's  disclosure and use of the Confidential  Information shall also not apply to the  disclosure of  information,  methods,  procedures,  techniques and knowledge which are or become  generally  known in the food service  business in the Territory, other than through disclosure (whether deliberate or inadvertent) by Franchisee.\n\n         Notwithstanding   the  foregoing  and  any  other   provision  of  this Agreement,  Franchisee may use the  Confidential  Information in connection with the operation of other Pretzel Time Units (in addition to the Unit)  pursuant to other Franchise Agreements with Pretzel Time.\n\n         22.B.  DISCLOSURE OF IDEAS AND NEW PROCEDURES.\n\n         Franchisee  shall  fully and  promptly  disclose to Pretzel  Time,  all ideas,  concepts,  methods  and  techniques  relating  to  the  development  and operation  of a dessert or snack food  business  conceived  or  developed by the Franchisee  and/or  Franchisee's  employees  during the term of this  Agreement. Franchisee  agrees and grants to Pretzel Time and its Affiliates a perpetual and worldwide  right to use and  authorize  other  Pretzel  Time Units or other food service businesses  operated by Pretzel Time or its Affiliates,  franchisees and designees  to  use  such  ideas,  recipes,  formulas,   concepts,  methods,  and techniques  relating to the development  and/or  operation of a dessert or snack food business.  If incorporated into the Pretzel Time System for the development and/or operation of Pretzel Time Units, such ideas, recipes, formulas, concepts, methods and techniques  shall become the sole and exclusive  property of Pretzel Time without any further consideration to Franchisee. Pretzel Time shall have no obligation to make any lump sum or on-going  payments to Franchisee with respect to any such idea, concept, method, technique or product.  Franchisee agrees that Franchisee  will not use nor will it allow any other person or entity to use any such concept,  method,  technique or product  without  obtaining  Pretzel Time's prior written approval.\n\n23.      ENFORCEMENT.\n\n         23.A.    UNAVOIDABLE DELAYS.\n\n         Delays in the  performance  of any duties  hereunder  which are not the fault of, and not within the reasonable  preventive control of, the party due to perform,  including but not limited to, fire,  flood,  labor  disputes,  natural disasters, acts of God, civil disorders, riots,  insurrections,  work stoppages, slowdowns or disputes,  or other  similar  events,  shall not cause a default in said  performance,  but the parties shall extend the time of  performance  for a period of time equivalent to the length of delay,  or for such other  reasonable period of time as agreed by the parties.\n\n         23.B.    RIGHTS OF PARTIES ARE CUMULATIVE.\n\n         The rights of Pretzel Time and Franchisee  hereunder are cumulative and no exercise or  enforcement by Pretzel Time or Franchisee of any right or remedy hereunder  shall  preclude  the  exercise  or  enforcement  by  Pretzel  Time or Franchisee  of any  other  right  or  remedy  herein  or which  Pretzel  Time or Franchisee is entitled by law to enforce.\n\n         23.C.    WAIVER OF OBLIGATIONS.\n\n         Pretzel Time may by written instrument unilaterally waive or reduce any obligation  of  or  restriction  upon  Franchisee  under  this  Agreement,   and Franchisee may by written instrument unilaterally waive or reduce any obligation of or  restriction  upon  Pretzel  Time under  this  Agreement,  effective  upon delivery of written  notice  thereof to the other or such other  effective  date stated on the notice of waiver.  Whenever this Agreement requires Pretzel Time's\n\n\n\n\n\nprior  approval  or  consent,  Franchisee  shall make a timely  written  request therefore, and such approval shall be obtained in writing. Pretzel Time makes no warranties  or  guaranties  upon  which  Franchisee  may rely,  and  assumes  no liability or  obligation  to  Franchisee,  by granting  any waiver,  approval or consent to  Franchisee,  or by reason of any  neglect,  delay,  or denial of any request therefore. Any waiver granted by Pretzel Time shall be without prejudice to any other rights Pretzel Time may have, will be subject\n\nto continuing review by Pretzel Time, and may be revoked, in Pretzel Time's sole discretion,  at any  time  and  for  any  reason,  effective  upon  delivery  to Franchisee of ten (10) days' prior written notice.\n\n         23.D.    CONTINUING OBLIGATIONS.\n\n          All  obligations of Pretzel Time and Franchisee  which expressly or by their very nature survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement  shall continue  in  full  force  and  effect  subsequent  to and  notwithstanding  its expiration  or  termination  and until  they are  satisfied  or by their  nature expire.\n\n         23.E.    INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE PROVISIONS.\n\n         If any provisions of this  Agreement,  or its application to any person or  circumstance,  is deemed  invalid or  unenforceable  by a court of competent jurisdiction,  then the remainder of this  Agreement or the  application of such provision  to other  persons or  circumstances  shall not be  affected  thereby, provided,  however,  that if any provision or application  thereof is invalid or unenforceable,  the court shall  substitute a suitable and  equitable  provision therefore  in order to carry out,  so far as may be valid and  enforceable,  the intent and purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision.\n\n         If any applicable and binding law or rule of any jurisdiction  requires a  greater  prior  notice  of the  termination  of or  refusal  to enter  into a successor Franchise  Agreement to this Agreement than is required hereunder,  or the  taking of some  other  action  not  required  hereunder,  or if,  under any applicable  and binding law or rule of any  jurisdiction,  any provision of this Agreement  or any  standard or procedure  outlined in the  Operations  Manual is invalid or unenforceable,  the prior notice and/or other action required by such law or rule shall be  substituted  for the  comparable  provisions  hereof,  and Pretzel  Time shall  have the  right,  in its sole  discretion,  to modify  such invalid or unenforceable operations procedure or standard to the extent required to be valid and enforceable.\n\n         23.F.  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.\n\n         Franchisee  recognizes and  acknowledges the unique value and secondary meaning  attached to the Pretzel Time system,  its  trademarks,  service  marks, standards of operation and Pretzel Time's property.  Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that any noncompliance with the restrictive  covenants  contained herein, including  without  limitation  those provisions  pertaining to  noncompetition, confidentiality  and the improper or  unauthorized  use of Pretzel  Time's Marks will cause  irreparable  damage to Pretzel Time and its franchisees.  Franchisee therefore agrees that should it violate any restrictive covenant, or threaten to breach the  restrictive  covenants,  then Pretzel Time shall be entitled to both permanent  and temporary  injunctive  relief,  without  bond,  from any court of competent  jurisdiction  in addition to any other remedies to which Pretzel Time may be entitled,  at law or in equity,  under this agreement or otherwise  under applicable law.\n\n         23.G.    APPLICABLE LAW.\n\n         Except to the extent governed by the U.S. Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.  \"1051 et seq.),  this Agreement,  the other agreements  referred herein,  and the offer and the sale of the  franchise  shall be  governed in all respects  and  aspects  by the  laws of the  Commonwealth  of  Pennsylvania  and expressly  excluding  the laws  pertaining  to the choice of law and conflict of laws.\n\n         23.H.    ENTIRE STATUS OF AGREEMENT.\n\n         This Agreement  contains the entire  agreement of the parties and there are no other oral or written  understandings or agreements  between Pretzel Time and Franchisee  relating to the subject matter of this agreement,  except as set forth in Pretzel  Time's  Offering  Circular  required by Rule under the Federal Trade  Commission  Act, a copy of which has been provided to  Franchisee  and of which   Franchisee   acknowledges   receipt,   there  are  no   representations, inducements, promises, agreements arrangements or undertakings, oral or written, between  the  parties  hereto  other than those set forth and duly  executed  in writing.  No agreement of any kind shall be binding upon either party unless and until the same has been made in writing and duly executed by both parties.\n\n         Upon  acceptance  of this  Agreement  by  Pretzel  Time,  all  previous agreements,  contracts,  arrangements  or  understandings  of any kind,  oral or written,  relative to the franchise granted herein are cancelled, and all claims and demands  thereon are fully  satisfied.  This  agreement,  although  drawn by Pretzel Time,  shall be construed  fairly and reasonable,  and not more strictly against one party than against the other party hereto.\n\n         23.I.    AMENDMENT OF AGREEMENT.\n\n         This  Agreement  shall not be  modified  or  amended  except by written\n\n\n\n\n\nagreement  executed by both parties hereto.  No oral amendment or waiver will be effective and that this provision cannot be orally amended or waived.  No waiver of default or rights will be effective unless in writing.\n\n         23.J.    HEIRS, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.\n\n         Subject to the provisions  hereof  relating to transfer and assignment, this Agreement is intended to and does bind the heirs, executors, administrators and successors of any or all of the parties hereto.\n\n         23.K.    CONDITIONS AND CONTINGENCIES.\n\n         The obligations of the parties hereunder are expressly  conditional and contingent  upon the full execution of and performance of all obligations by the parties  under this  Agreement.  This  Agreement is expressly  conditional  upon Franchisee  executing all documents  required by this Agreement  within ten (10) days of receipt of the document.  Failure by Franchisee to execute any documents shall result in the Agreement being null and void.\n\n         In addition during Franchisee's  training,  all documents pertaining to the  franchising of Franchisee as a Pretzel Time Unit shall be held in escrow by Pretzel Time. Title in and to the Pretzel Time Unit shall not pass to Franchisee until  Franchisee  has  been  trained  as  a  Pretzel  Time  franchisee  to  the satisfaction  of Pretzel Time. If Franchisee  fails to  satisfactorily  complete Pretzel Time initial  training,  the appointment of Franchisee as a Pretzel Time franchisee  and the granting of the franchise  business to  Franchisee  shall be null and void, all documents executed between Franchisee and Pretzel Time or its designees with respect to the transaction shall be terminated and cancelled. The Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that no portion of the Franchise fee shall be refunded if Franchisee  fails to complete  Pretzel Time's initial training class to the  satisfaction  of Pretzel Time. If the  Franchisee  completes the initial training to the  satisfaction  of Pretzel  Time,  Pretzel  Time will  provide to Franchisee fully signed copies of the Franchise Agreement.\n\n         It is  understood  and agreed by the parties  that the  granting of the franchise  and all  contracts  and  agreements  entered  into by and between the parties with respect to the Unit are specifically contingent upon the signing of a lease for the Site.  In the event that a lease for the Site cannot be obtained on or before sixty (60) days after  delivery of Pretzel  Time's  approval of the Site at no fault  or delay by  Franchisee,  then all  contracts  and  agreements entered into by Pretzel Time, and  Franchisee  shall become null and void and of no effect,  and all monies  deposited by Franchisee less a nonrefundable  fee of $2,500 shall be refunded.\n\n         23.L.    WAIVER BY PRETZEL TIME.\n\n         No waiver by  Pretzel  Time of any  default  or  failure  to perform by Franchisee,  or of any  breach of the  terms of this  Agreement  or no  failure, refusal or neglect of Pretzel Time to exercise any right,  option or power given it under this Agreement,  shall preclude Pretzel Time from thereafter  requiring strict  compliance or from declaring  this  Agreement and the franchise  granted herein  revoke or  terminated.  The failure of Pretzel  Time to  terminate  this Agreement upon the occurrence of one or more Acts of Default will not constitute a waiver  or  otherwise  affect  the right of  Pretzel  Time to  terminate  this Franchise  because of a continuing or subsequent  failure to cure one or more of the aforesaid events of default or any other default.\n\n         23.M.    COSTS AND EXPENSES OF ENFORCEMENT.\n\n         If a claim  for  amounts  owed by  Franchisee  to  Pretzel  Time or its Affiliates  is  asserted  in any  judicial or  arbitration  proceeding  or later appeal,  or if Pretzel Time is required to enforce the Franchise  Agreement in a judicial or arbitration proceeding or later appeal, the prevailing party will be entitled  to  reimbursement  of its costs  and  expenses,  including  reasonable arbitrators',  accountants'  and  legal  fees,  whether  incurred  prior  to, in preparation for or in contemplation of the filing of any written demand,  claim, action,  hearing or  proceeding  to enforce  the  obligations  of the  Franchise Agreement.  If Pretzel Time incurs  expenses in connection  with your failure to pay when due amounts  owing to Pretzel  Time,  to submit  when due any  reports, information  or  supporting  records or otherwise  to comply with the  Franchise Agreement,  including,  but not limited to legal,  arbitrators'  and  accounting fees, you are required to reimburse Pretzel Time for any such costs and expenses which it incurs.          23.N.    RIGHTS OF PARTIES ARE CUMULATIVE\n\n         THE  RIGHTS  OF  FRANCHISEE  AND  PRETZEL  TIME ARE  CUMULATIVE  AND NO EXERCISE OR  ENFORCEMENT  BY PRETZEL TIME OR  FRANCHISEE  OF ANY RIGHT OR REMEDY HEREUNDER  SHALL  PRECLUDE  THE  EXERCISE  OR  ENFORCEMENT  BY  PRETZEL  TIME OR FRANCHISEE OF ANY OTHER RIGHT OR REMEDY TO WHICH THE PARTY IS ENTITLED.\n\n         23.O.    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.\n\n     BOTH PRETZEL TIME AND THE  FRANCHISEE  IRREVOCABLY  WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM,  WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, BROUGHT BY EITHER PARTY.  THE PARTIES  FURTHER AGREE THAT NEITHER SHALL DEMAND A JURY TRIAL IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION.\n\n         23.P.  WAIVER OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES.\n\n         EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO  FRANCHISEE'S  OBLIGATION  TO INDEMNIFY  PRETZEL TIME, THE PARTIES WAIVE TO THE FULLEST  EXTENT  PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT TO OR CLAIM FOR ANY PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AGAINST THE OTHER AND AGREE THAT, IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE  BETWEEN THEM,  THE PARTY MAKING A CLAIM SHALL BE LIMITED TO RECOVERY OF ANY ACTUAL DAMAGES IT SUSTAINS.\n\n\n\n\n\n         23.Q.  EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION.\n\n         BOTH PRETZEL TIME AND  FRANCHISEE  AGREE THAT ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING  TO THIS  AGREEMENT,  INCLUDING  WITHOUT  LIMITATION,  THE OFFER AND GRANTING OF THE FRANCHISE  RIGHTS  HEREUNDER  SHALL BE INSTITUTED AND MAINTAINED ONLY IN A STATE OR FEDERAL  COURT OF  GENERAL  JURISDICTION  IN DAUPHIN  COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA  OR THE COUNTY IN WHICH PRETZEL TIME MAINTAINS ITS PRINCIPAL  PLACE OF BUSINESS.\n\n         FRANCHISEE  IRREVOCABLY  SUBMITS TO THE  JURISDICTION OF SAID COURT AND WAIVES ANY OBJECTION  FRANCHISEE MAY HAVE TO EITHER THE JURISDICTION OR VENUE OF SUCH COURT.\n\n         23.R.    LIMITATIONS OF CLAIMS\n\n         EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS  BROUGHT BY PRETZEL TIME WITH REGARD TO  FRANCHISEE'S OBLIGATIONS  TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO PRETZEL TIME  PURSUANT TO THIS  AGREEMENT OR TO INDEMNIFY  PRETZEL TIME PURSUANT TO THIS  AGREEMENT,  ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS  AGREEMENT  OR THE  RELATIONSHIP  OF  FRANCHISEE  AND PRETZEL  TIME  PURSUANT TO THIS  AGREEMENT  SHALL BE BARRED  UNLESS AN ACTION IS COMMENCED  WITHIN:  (1) TWO (2)  YEARS  FROM THE DATE ON WHICH  THE ACT OR EVENT GIVING  RISE TO THE  CLAIM  OCCURRED  OR (2) ONE (1) YEAR FROM THE DATE ON WHICH FRANCHISEE  OR  PRETZEL  TIME KNEW OR SHOULD  HAVE  KNOWN,  IN THE  EXERCISE  OF REASONABLE  DILIGENCE OF THE FACTS GIVEN RISE TO SUCH CLAIMS,  WHICHEVER  OCCURS FIRST.\n\n24.      ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND REPRESENTATIONS.\n\n         Franchisee  acknowledges  that he has read this  Agreement  and that he understands  and accepts the terms,  conditions and covenants  contained in this Agreement as being reasonably  necessary to maintain Pretzel Time's high quality and service and the uniformity of those  standards at all Pretzel Time Units and thereby to protect and preserve the goodwill of the Marks.\n\n         Pretzel Time  disclaims  and  Franchisee  acknowledges  that he has not received or relied upon any representations, promises, guarantees or warranties, expressed  or  implied,  made to induce the  execution  hereof or in  connection herewith which is not expressly contained herein or in the disclosure statement. More specifically,  Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees that no person acting on behalf of Pretzel Time or its affiliated  companies has made any written or oral claim,  statement,  assurance,  promise or projection of any sort  regarding the actual  or  prospective  sales,  earnings,  gross  profit  or net  profit of the franchise,  which is the subject of this agreement.  Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that Pretzel Time's officers, directors, employees and agents act only in a representative  and not in a personal capacity in connection with any of their dealings with  Franchisee.  Franchisee  recognizes that neither Pretzel Time nor any other person can guarantee  Franchisee's success in the franchised business. Franchisee  further  represents  to Pretzel  Time, as an inducement to its entry into this  Agreement,  that all statements in  Franchisee's  application for the Franchise   are  accurate  and  complete  and  that   Franchisee   has  made  no misrepresentations or material omissions in obtaining the franchise.\n\n25.

HEADINGS.\n\n         The Section headings  throughout this Agreement are for the convenience and reference only of the parties and their  attorneys,  and the words contained therein shall not be held to expand,  modify,  limit, define,  amplify or aid in the interpretation, construction or meaning of this Agreement.\n\n         25.B.

The  term  Franchisee  as  used  herein  is  applicable  to one or more persons,  a  corporation  or a  partnership,  as the case may be. If two or more persons are at any time Franchisee hereunder,  their obligations and liabilities to  Pretzel  Time  shall be joint and  several.  References  to  Franchisee  and assignee  which are  applicable to an individual or  individuals  shall mean the Owners of  Franchisee or the  assignee,  if the  Franchisee or the assignee is a corporation nor partnership.\n\n         25.C.    COUNTERPARTS.\n\n         This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, any and all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument.\n\n         25.D.  REASONABLENESS.\n\n         Pretzel Time and  Franchisee  agree to act  reasonably  in all dealings with each other pursuant to this Agreement.  Whenever the consent or approval of either party is required or  contemplated,  the party whose  consent is required agrees not to unreasonably  withhold the same,  unless such consent is expressly subject to such party's sole discretion pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. In no event shall Pretzel Time's withholding of consent allow Franchisee a claim for money damages.\n\n26.      SECURITY AGREEMENT.\n\n\n\n\n\n         26.A.    SECURITY INTEREST.\n\n         In order  to  secure  full and  prompt  payment  of the fees and  other charges to be paid by Franchisee to Pretzel Time,  and to secure  performance of the other  obligations  and covenants to be performed by Franchisee,  under this Agreement,  Franchisee hereby grants Pretzel Time a valid and effectual security interest  in,  lien  upon,  and  right of set off  against  all of  Franchisee's interest  in  the  improvements,  fixtures,  inventory,  goods,  appliances  and equipment now or hereafter owned and located at the Unit (whether annexed to the Premises or not) or used in connection with the business  conducted at the Unit, including,  without in any manner limiting the generality of the foregoing,  all machinery,  materials,  appliances and fixtures for  generating or  distributing air, water, heat,  electricity,  light, fuel or refrigeration,  for ventilating, cooling or sanitary purposes, for the exclusion of vermin or insects and for the removal  of  dust,   refuse  or  garbage;   all   engines,   machinery,   ovens, refrigerators,   freezers,  furnaces,   partitions,  doors,  vaults,  sprinkling systems, light fixtures,  fire hoses, fire brackets,  fire boxes, alarm systems, brackets,  screens,  floor tile,  linoleum,  carpets,  plumbing,  water systems, appliances,  walk-in refrigerator boxes, cabinets,  dishwashers,  stoves, set-up tables,  rolling  counters,   kitchen  ranges,  display  counters  and  shelves, humidified  cabinets,  computers and computer software,  and other equipment and installations;  all other and  further  installations  and  appliances;  all raw materials,   work  in  process,  finished  goods  and  all  inventory;  and  all replacements  thereof,  attachments,   additions  and  accessions  thereto,  and products  and  proceeds  thereof  in any  form,  including  but not  limited  to insurance proceeds and any claims against third parties for loss or damage to or destruction  of any or all of the foregoing  (collectively,  the  \"Collateral\"). Without the prior  written  consent of Pretzel Time,  Franchisee  agrees that no lien upon or security  interest in the  Collateral  or any item  thereof will be created or suffered  to be created  and that no lease will be entered  into with respect to any item of Collateral. Franchisee will not sell or otherwise dispose of any item of Collateral,  or remove any Collateral  from the Premises,  unless the same is replaced by a similar item of equal or greater value, and except for the sale of  inventory in the  ordinary  course of  business,  without the prior written  consent  of Pretzel  Time.  Franchisee  agrees to give to Pretzel  Time advance notice in writing of any proposed change in Franchisee's name,  identity or structure and not to make any such change  without the prior written  consent of Pretzel Time and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. Franchisee agrees  to  execute  for  filing  such  financing  statements  and  continuation statements as Pretzel Time may require from time to time. Pretzel Time agrees to pay all filing  fees,  including  fees for  filing  continuation  statements  in connection with such financing statements.\n\n         26.B.  DEFAULT REMEDIES UNDER U.C.C.\n\n         In the event of a default by Franchisee  under this Agreement,  Pretzel Time  shall  have the  remedies  and rights  available  as a secured  party with respect to the Collateral  under the Uniform  Commercial  Code as in effect from time to time in the  state  where the  premises  are  located.  The grant of the security interest to Franchisee  pursuant to this Section shall not be construed to derogate  from or impair any other rights  which  Pretzel Time may have under this Agreement or otherwise at law or equity.\n\n27.      NOTICES.\n\n         27.A.    DELIVERY OF NOTICES.\n\n         All  written  notices  permitted  or required  to be  delivered  by the provisions  of this  Agreement  or of the  Operations  Manual shall be deemed so delivered to the Franchisee:\n\n         a.

It also provides an \"effort level\" quantity that indicates the level of effort of the caller. The functional and performance requirements are specified to cover a wide range of applications, such as voice activated recordings (as in voice messaging), outbound call classification, digital speech interpolation (DSI), and voice conferencing.\n\n1.       The Voice Activity Detector classifies every block of voice data (8 ms          long) as \"port active\" (early detect), \"speaker active\" (port          sustained), and \"not active\".\n\n2.       It provides a measurement that approximates the level of effort exerted          by the caller. Such an approximation is made by normalizing the short          term RMS of the voice signal by a longer term RMS value. The \"effort          level\" varies between -32 dB and 31 dB, and is at 0 dB when the speaker          is speaking at his/her \"normal\" level.\n\n3.       The Voice Activity Detector adapts to background noise up to -24 dBm.          Adaptation is 200 ms when the noise level drops, and is approximately          1000 ms when noise rises.\n\n4.       The Voice Activity Detector screens out sidetone or echo as speech up          to an ERL of -26 dB.\n\nSoftware License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc. and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL    21\n\nA.2.2    Performance Requirements:\n\nThe accuracy of the voice Activity detector is measured by the rate of \"false detection\" (i.e. classifying noise or echo as voice activity) and \"clipping\" (i.e. classifying voice activity as noise or echo) under different ambient noise and echo conditions. \"Port active\" detection under different ambient noise conditions:\n\n1.       No perceptible clipping at quiet to modest noise levels of -50 dBm to          -40 dBm with nominal levels of speech activity (-20 dBm average power          over 2 seconds of speech). No more than 5% of voice onsets is clipped          for noisy conditions (noise level from -40 dBm to -30 dBm).\n\n2.       No more than 1% of \"silence\" periods is detected as speech for the          modest noise condition. No more than 2% of \"silence\" is detected as          port active for noisy conditions.\n\n3.       The performance goals above is met when noise levels change during the          test.\n\n\"Speaker active\" detection under different ambient noise conditions:\n\n1.       Speech activity that lasts more than tSUSTAIN is detected as          \"Sustained\" or \"Speaker Active\".\n\n2.       The clipping requirements is better than \"Port Activity\" detection.          Fewer than 0.5% of onsets/hour (2.5 per hour) for modest noise          condition (-45 dBm) and fewer than 2% (10 per hour) for high noise          condition (-35 dBm) have perceptible clipping.\n\n3.       False detection performance (i.e., detecting noise as \"speaker active\")          exceeds those of \"port activity\" due to tSUSTAIN criteria. No more than          1% (36 seconds per hour) of noise segments is misclassified as          \"sustained\" for modest noise conditions, and no more than 2% (72          seconds per hour) of \"silence\" is detected as port active for noisy          conditions.\n\n\"Port active\" and \"Speaker active\" detection in the presence of echo:\n\n1.       Less than 1% of residual echo is detected as \"port active\" - (i.e. 36          sec. per hour) during normal operation of canceller.\n\n2.       Less than 0.1 % (i.e. 3.6 sec per hour) of residual echo is detected as          \"speaker active\" or \"port sustained\" during normal operation of          canceller.\n\n3.       Clipping of input speech in the presence of echo is no higher than          clipping in the presence of modest to high level of noise.\n\nSoftware License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc. and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL\n\n22\n\nA.3      DTMF Detection\n\nA.3.1    Functional requirements:\n\nTable A-1 specifies the nominal frequencies for the DTMF digits that must be detected.\n\n      --------------------------------------------------------------                                     Nominal High Group Frequencies (Hz)                                     1209      1336       1477      1633          --------------------------------------------------------------            Nominal        697        1         2          3         A\n\n\n\n\n\n       Low Group       770        4         5          6         B          Frequencies      852        7         8          9         C             (Hz)          941        *         0          #         D          --------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                    Table A-1: Nominal DTMF Frequencies\n\n1.       Detect the presence of all 16 DTMF digits that are produced by          different phones on the market under a broad range of network          conditions.\n\n2.       DTMF digit information is provided as soon as the minimum duration is          met. This information is called leading edge detection. This allows the          earliest possible response to the digit, such as stopping voice output.\n\n3.       The trailing edge of a DTMF digit must be detected. This allows the          system to delay any response (such as playing out voice) to the digit          until the user has released the DTMF key. The criteria selected for          trailing edge detection will debounce DTMF digits.\n\n4.       The DSP reports leading and trailing edge in the 8 ms block that they          are detected.  DTMF events are not buffered.\n\nA.3.2    Performance requirements:\n\nTable A-2 consists of performance requirements taken from EIA-464A and Bellcore TR-TSY-000181.

Talk-down: DTMF detection must work reliably in the presence of echo          (for the maximum allowable output voice level) and with varying levels          of DTMF signals (due to network loss). D2's DTMF detector combined with          the echo must meet the performance requirements of Figure A-I in the          presence echo generated by playing pause-removed voice (male and          female) at - 18 dBm ASL (averaged over 3 seconds) over a telephone          circuit with 15 dB echo return loss (ERL).\n\n                               INSERT GRAPH\n\n                Figure A-1: DTMF Talk-down Acceptance Curve\n\n3.       Debounce test: Long tones (generated by \"hard\" key presses) must not be          detected as multiple tones in the presence of echo interference or line          noise. Combined with the echo canceller, the DTMF detector is required          to reliably \"debounce\" all DTMF digits above -18 dBm in the presence of          voice levels below -15 dBm (ASL) and a telephone circuit with echo          return loss (ERL) of 15 dB.\n\nSoftware License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc. and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL\n\n25\n\n4.       Double-talk talk-off: Many voice processing hardware or semiconductor          manufacturers significantly degrade the \"talk-off' performance of their          detector in the presence of voice echo or sidetone to achieve a high          level of talk-down performance. This strategy is acceptable in a pure          digit-in-voice-out scenario, but for voice conferencing or voice          recognition applications, voice could be present in the both the          transmit and receive path. In such cases, the DTMF detector must be          very robust against \"talk-off\" in double-talk situations. The talk-off          requirements for D2's DTMF detector under double-talk is fewer than 66          talkoffs for the Bellcore talk-off tape.\n\nA.4      Tone Generation\n\nThe tone generation module can be programmed to generate any single, dual or amplitude modulated tone required to meet international telecommunications specifications. This functionality is provided by the GENF module, which produces the sum or product of two independently generated sine waves as its output. Each sine wave can be individually parameterized.\n\nA.4.l    Functional requirements:\n\nThe GENF module is designed to generate a wide range of DTMF, Call Progress Signals, MF Rl/R2, and miscellaneous tones. In order to meet or exceed international telecommunication specifications, GENF must meet or exceed the following functional requirements.\n\n1.       Independent arguments shall be supplied for each frequency for dual          tones that GENF generates. Single tones are generated by specifying          that one of the dual tone's frequencies is 0 Hz.\n\n2.       Independent arguments shall be supplied for the carrier and modulation          frequencies for amplitude modulated tones that GENF generates.\n\n3.       Arguments shall be supplied that allow the frequency of a tone to be          set in the range of 0 to 4000 Hz in 1 Hz units.\n\n4.       Arguments shall be supplied that allow the output power to be set in          the range of +3 to -50 dBm in 0.5 dB steps.\n\n5.       Arguments shall be supplied that allow an amplitude modulated tone's          modulation percentage to be set in the range of 0 to 300% in 1% units.\n\n6.       The tone duration (make time) shall be specified in 1 ms units. Tone          durations shall be specified in the range of 0 to 8191 ms.\n\nSoftware License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc. and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL\n\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n7.       An unlimited tone duration shall be specified by setting the make          duration to -1.\n\n8.       The silence duration between tones (break time) shall be specified in 1          ms units. Silence durations shall be specified in the range of 0 to          8191 ms.\n\n9.       An unlimited silence duration shall be specified by setting the make          duration to -1 and setting both frequencies of a dual tone to 0 Hz.\n\n10.      The GENF module shall allow tones to be generated that meet or exceed          EIA/TIA-464 requirement for DTMF and call progress tone generation.\n\n11.      The GENF module shall allow tones to be generated that meet or exceed          CCITT Blue Book Volume VI Fascicle VI.4 recommendations Q.310-Q.490          requirements for MF R1 and R2 tone generation.\n\n12.      The GENF module shall generate tones with one to three unique cadence          pairs (on/off pairs).\n\nA.4.2    Performance Requirements\n\n1.       Frequency accuracy shall exceed 1 Hz. 2.       Level accuracy shall exceed 0.5 dB. 3.       Timing information shall exceed 1 ms accuracy.\n\nA.5      Universal Tone Detector\n\nA.5.l    Overview\n\nThe Universal Tone Detector (UTD) is a high configurable tone detector. By changing parameters, this algorithm can classify a wide range of single and dual tone call progress signals generated in a wide variety of countries.\n\nA.5.2    General\n\nSince different tones need different detection heuristics, and tones may have multiple specifications, each tone is tagged with a tone category identifier.\n\nSoftware License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc. and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL\n\n27\n\n               -----------------------------------------------                   Tone Category             Call Progress Signal                   -----------------------------------------------                          1                  Modem                          2                  FAX CNG                          3                  Audible Ringback                          4                  Busy                          5                  Reorder or Congestion                          6                  Number Unobtainable                          7                  SIT                          8                  Dial tone                          9                  Unknown Tone                   -----------------------------------------------\n\n                        Table A-3: Tone Categories\n\nIn addition to specifying a tone category, the parameters include a value that is returned to the application when the tone is detected. This parameter need not be unique. This allows multiple specifications to report the same tone event to the application. UTD is table driven. Using this approach, the tone detector searches parameter tables for a matching tone. When a tone matches, the tone code determines the heuristics necessary to completely classify the tone. Also, the tones must be specified in a way that a set of parameters corresponds to either a single tone, a dual tone, or an amplitude modulated tone.\n\n                     ---------------------------------                         Code               Tone Type                         ---------------------------------                          0                 Single Tone                          1                 Dual Tone                          2                 Modulated Tone                         ---------------------------------\n\n                    Table A-4: Call Progress Tone Types\n\nA.5.3    General Functional Requirements\n\nUTD functionally combines a single tone detector and a dual/modulated tone detector into a single module. UTD combines the results of these detectors into a single result. UTD has the following requirements.\n\n1.       The DSP shall indicate that the first ringback has started after at          least 400 ms of ringback like signal has been processed, as long as no          other tone type is early detected. If more than one type of tone is          early detected, the first ringback reporting shall be delayed until          either cadence information disqualifies the other types, or tone          precedence is used as a 'tie-breaker'.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc. and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL\n\n28\n\n2.       The DSP shall indicate ringback has stopped when ringback is no longer          detected.\n\n3.       The DSP shall indicate a busy tone has been detected after the          requisite number of make and break intervals have been processed, and          no other tone category is still a candidate for detection.\n\n4.       The DSP shall indicate a reorder tone has been detected after the          requisite number of make and break intervals have been processed, and          no other tone category is still a candidate for detection.\n\n5.       The DSP shall indicate a number unobtainable tone has been detected          after the requisite number of make and break intervals have been          processed, and no other tone category is still a candidate for          detection.\n\n6.       In the event that more than one tone is a candidate for detection,          detection is delayed until all characteristics that may disqualify any          of the candidates are tested (for example, waiting for multiple cadence          pairs to occur). If there is still more than one potential tone after          all differentiating features have been exhausted, then the tone with          the highest precedence is detected. Also, if the tone ceases prior to          singling out one candidate tone, then the tone with the highest          precedence is detected. Precedence is shown in Table A-3.\n\n7.       The DSP shall supply an early detect flag. This flag shall be valid          after the detector has processed no more than 72 ms of a tone. If more          than one tone category is early detected, then the early detect flag          shall indicate the tone category with the highest precedence.\n\n8.       The DSP shall indicate that a modem has been detected if a single tone          falls within the specified frequencies for modem tones, the minimum          make interval has been exceeded while the average tone power is in          excess of the minimum power requirement, and no other tone category is          still a candidate for detection.\n\n9.       The DSP shall indicate that a FAX CNG tone has been detected if a          single tone falls within the specified frequencies for a CNG tone, the          requisite number of on/off cadences have been processed, and no other          tone category is still a candidate for detection.\n\n10.      The DSP shall indicate that a SIT tone has been detected if at least          two of the three segments of possible SIT tones have been detected for          at least the minimum interval in excess of the minimum power          requirement.\n\nSoftware License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc. and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL\n\n29\n\n11.      The DSP shall indicate that an Unknown tone has been detected when it          has been determined that a tone has been detected that falls within the          specified frequencies for an Unknown tone, the minimum duration has          been exceeded, and the tone does not match and other category tones.\n\nA.5.3.1 TONE DETECTOR PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS\n\nA.5.3.1.1 Single Tones\n\nThere are four types of parameters that shall be used to control single tone detection. The variation of each parameter shall be limited by the constraints listed in Table A-5.\n\n                                      ------------------------------                                          Minimum             Maximum          --------------------------------------------------------------          Frequency                       300 Hz              3300 Hz          --------------------------------------------------------------          Bandwidth                       0 Hz                1800 Hz          --------------------------------------------------------------          Duration                        100 msec            32760 msec          --------------------------------------------------------------          Minimum Power Level             -45 dBm             3 dBm          --------------------------------------------------------------\n\n               Table A-5: Single Tone Detection Constraints\n\nThe frequency detection range shall be specified the Frequency and Bandwidth parameters. Figure A-2 shows the relationship of these parameters. Note that the bandwidth specification is symmetric about the center frequency. The Frequency and Bandwidth parameters define a \"must detect\" range. The detector shall not use frequency criteria to reject any tones which are within the range specified Frequency/Bandwidth parameters. Tones whose frequencies are outside but close to frequency range may be detected.\n\nSoftware License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc. and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n                               INSERT GRAPH\n\nFigure A-2: Frequency Domain Representation of tone parameters for a             Single Tone\n\nIf the Power Level of the detected parameter is greater than the minimum power specified by the parameters, the signal shall not be rejected by Power Level heuristics. Duration parameters are used to set the allowable duration of a tone. Minimum and maximum tone durations may be specified (make durations). Also, minimum and maximum silence durations between tones may be specified.\n\nA.5.3.1.2         Dual Tones\n\nDual tones are created by summing two sinusoids. Since each tone can be isolated in the frequency domain, dual tones are specified as a pair of single tones. Parameters for each tone of a dual pair use the same constraints as single tones. Namely, frequency1 is the center frequency of the lower tone, and bandwidth1 specifies its frequency tolerance. The same is true for frequency2 and bandwidth2 for the high tone. Figure A-3 shows the definition of the frequency and bandwidth parameters for a dual tone.\n\n                               INSERT GRAPH\n\nFigure A-3: Frequency Domain Representation of Tone Parameters for a Dual Tone\n\nSoftware License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc. and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL\n\n31\n\nNot all dual tones are detectable by UTD. A dual tone shall detected only when the difference between the two component frequencies is greater than 10 Hz and less than 230Hz.\n\nA.5.3.1.3         Amplitude Modulated Tones\n\nAmplitude modulated tones are created by multiplying two sinusoids. When analyzed in the frequency domain, a modulated tone looks like three tones. Figure A-4 shows the frequency spectrum for a modulated tone.\n\nThe tone whose frequency is the average of the other tones is the carrier. The other two tones can be referred to as side lobes. For amplitude modulated tones, frequencyl and bandwidth1 specify the low sidelobe and its tolerance, while frequency2 and bandwidth2 specify the high sidelobe and its tolerance.\n\n                               INSERT GRAPH\n\n      Figure A-4: Frequency Domain Representation of Tone Parameters                          for an Amplitude Modulated Tone\n\nAs with dual tones, not all modulated tones will be detected by UTD. Modulated tones shall be detected if the difference between the carrier frequency and the sidelobes is between 10 Hz and 230 Hz.\n\nA.5.3.l.4         Precedence\n\nBy assigning a detection precedence to the classification process, tone frequency ranges can overlap. When a tone's parameters fall into a range shared by two or more signals, the signal is classified as the one with the highest precedence.\n\nSoftware License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc. and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL\n\n32\n\n               -------------------------------------------                   Precedence            Call Progress Signal\n\n\n\n\n\n               -------------------------------------------                       1                 Modem                       2                 FAX CNG                       3                 Audible Ringback                       4                 Busy                       5                 Reorder or Congestion                       6                 Number Unobtainable                       7                 SIT                       8                 Dial Tone                       9                 Unknown Tone                   -------------------------------------------\n\n                   Table A-6: Tone Detection Precedence\n\nTable A-6 shows the precedence of typical tones that the UTD module detects.

Therefore, the frequency range of unknown tones can safely overlap the other tone ranges without causing tones to be misclassified. If the range for Unknown tones is allowed to be the maximum range allowed by the detector, any detected tone that is unclassified would be designated as Unknown.\n\nA.5.3.1.5         North American Call Progress Signal Detection\n\nFunctional Requirements:\n\nThe tables below specify the frequencies, power levels, and cadence of the Bellcore and EIA-464A call progress tones.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                         Frequency (Hz)                 Power Level (dBm) - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------     Name         350     440     480     620     Per Frequency        Combined - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Audible Ring              X       X               -22.5 +/- 1.5 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------     Busy                          X       X        -27 +/- 1.5 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Dial Tone       X       X                       -17.5 to  -15     -13 to -14.5 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Intercept               X               X        -20 +/- 1.5 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Reorder                        X       X        -27 +/- 1.5 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      Table A-7: Call Progress Tone Frequency and Power Requirements\n\nSoftware License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc. and Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL\n\n33\n\n- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Audible ring (ring-       repetition of the tone on for 0.8 to 2.2 seconds, and  back)                     off for 2.7 to 4.4 seconds - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Busy                      repetition of the tone on for 0.5+/-0.05 seconds, and                            off for 0.5 +/-0.05 seconds - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dial                      steady uninterrupted - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Intercept                 repetition of an alternating sequence, of the two                           frequencies each being on for 0.16 to 0.30 seconds                           with a total cycle time of 0.5 +/-0.05 seconds - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Reorder (fast busy)       repetition of the tone on for 0.25+/-0.025 seconds,                            and off for 0.25+/-0.025 seconds - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                   Table A-8: Call Progress Tone Cadence\n\nPerformance Requirements:\n\n1.

Hence for incoming calls, the EVP software has to detect a CNG signal. When CNG is detected, EVP alerts the Core Processor to redirect the call to a FAX machine or a FAX modem embedded within the call processing system.\n\nSoftware License                                           D2 Technologies, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\nand Maintenance Agreement       August 4, 1997                      CONFIDENTIAL\n\n34\n\nFunctional Requirements:\n\nDetect the presence of the FAX calling tone (CNG).

SIT sequences are generated by various central offices or common carrier switching points to indicate a problem with the dialed call. A SIT tone sequence generally precedes a recorded voice announcement such as \"the number you have dialed is no longer in service...\" and is provided specifically for the purpose of detection of the problem type by an automated device.\n\nThere are two popular types of SIT sequences. The first type is used mainly in Europe. It consists of a sequence of three tones of identical durations. The second type is the one used in North America. There are several North American SIT sequences that are encoded using various combinations of frequency and duration for each of the three tones. The encoding has been standardized by Bellcore.\n\nPerformance Requirements:\n\n1.       The UTD shall handle both types of sequences.\n\n2.       There is no talkdown performance requirement.

PB will indemnify and hold SFJ, its Affiliates, SFJ's investors and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents (the \"SFJ Indemnified Parties\"), harmless from any and all Losses, net of any related tax benefit actually realized in the same year as the payment or incurrence of such Losses or any prior year, arising or resulting from any Claims by a Third Party against any SFJ Indemnified Parties to the extent arising from (a) a Product supplied by PB; (b) a physical injury or death of a Subject that is caused by the Subject's participation in the Clinical Trials whether or not directly attributable to the Product (excluding any Clinical Trial conducted by or on behalf of SFJ or its Affiliate after a Program Transfer); (c) PB's gross negligence or willful misconduct in performing its obligations under this Agreement or, if applicable, the Program Transfer Agreement; (d) PB's material breach of this Agreement or, if applicable, the Program Transfer Agreement, (e) any material breach of a Protocol by PB, or its Affiliate, or of its or their respective Permitted Third Parties, (f) actual or alleged infringement of any Third Party's Intellectual Property by the Product or by either Party in performing its duties or obligations hereunder with respect to the Product; and (g) injuries sustained by Subjects in connection with the Clinical Trials, including Claims arising prior to the Effective Date based upon physical injury or death of a Subject in connection with the Clinical Trials, or from the Commercialization of the Product; except to the extent that any of the foregoing (a) through (g) were caused by (i) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any\n\nSource: PHASEBIO PHARMACEUTICALS INC, 10-K, 3/30/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nSFJ Indemnified Party, or (ii) material breach of this Agreement, or, if applicable, the Program Transfer Agreement by, SFJ.\n\n12.2 Indemnification Procedure.\n\n12.2.1 Notice of Claim. A Party believing that it is entitled to indemnification under Section 12.1.1 or 12.1.2 (an \"Indemnified Party\") will give prompt written notice (each, an \"Indemnification Claim Notice\") to the other Party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") upon receipt of notice of the commencement of any Claim for which indemnification may be sought, or if earlier, upon the assertion of any such Claim by a Third Party (it being understood and agreed, however, that the failure by an Indemnified Party to give notice of a Claim of a Third Party as provided in this Section 12.2.1 will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligation under this Agreement except and only to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced as a result of such failure to give notice). Each Indemnification Claim Notice will contain a description of the Claim and the nature and amount of the Loss (to the extent that the nature and amount of such Loss are known at such time). The Indemnified Party will furnish promptly to the Indemnifying Party copies of all papers and official documents received in respect of any Losses.\n\n12.2.2 Control of Defense. At its option, the Indemnifying Party may assume the defense of any Claim by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within [***] after the Indemnifying Party's receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice. The assumption of the defense of a Claim by the Indemnifying Party will not be construed as an acknowledgment that the Indemnifying Party is liable to indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect of the Claim, nor will it constitute a waiver by the Indemnifying Party of any defenses it may assert against the Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification. Upon assuming the defense of a Claim, the Indemnifying Party may appoint as lead counsel in the defense of the Claim any legal counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party that is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. In the event the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Claim, the Indemnified Party will promptly deliver to the Indemnifying Party all original notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party in connection with the Claim. Should the Indemnifying Party assume the defense of a Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the analysis, defense or settlement of such Claim.\n\n12.2.3 Right to Participate in Defense. Without limiting Section 12.2.2, the Indemnified Party will be entitled to (a) participate in, but not control, the defense of such Claim and to engage counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided, however, that such engagement will be at the Indemnified Party's own expense unless the engagement thereof has been specifically authorized by the Indemnifying Party in writing, and (b) control its defense of such Claim and to engage counsel of its choice for such purpose, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, if the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense and engage counsel in accordance with Section 12.2.2.\n\n12.2.4 Settlement. With respect to any Losses related solely to payment of money damages in connection with a Claim and that includes a complete and unconditional\n\nSource: PHASEBIO PHARMACEUTICALS INC, 10-K, 3/30/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nrelease of the Indemnified Party, will not result in the Indemnified Party admitting liability, becoming subject to injunctive or other equitable relief that will otherwise adversely affect the business of the Indemnified Party in any manner, and as to which the Indemnifying Party will have acknowledged in writing the obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder, the Indemnifying Party will have the sole right to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss, on such terms as the Indemnifying Party, in its sole discretion, will deem appropriate. With respect to all other Losses in connection with Claims, where the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the Claim in accordance with Section 12.2.2, the Indemnifying Party will have authority to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss provided it obtains the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any settlement or other disposition of a Loss by the Indemnified Party that is reached without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Regardless of whether the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Claim, the Indemnified Party will not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.\n\n12.2.5 Cooperation. Regardless of whether the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Claim, the Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and will furnish such records, information and testimony, provide such witnesses and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. Such cooperation will include access during normal business hours afforded to the Indemnifying Party to, and reasonable retention by the Indemnified Party of, records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Claim, and making employees and agents available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder, and the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith.\n\n12.3 Insurance.\n\n12.3.1 Generally. Commencing as of the Effective Date and thereafter during the Development Term, and subject to Section 12.3.2 below, each Party will carry and maintain, at its own expense, insurance coverage of the kind and with liability limits that, at a minimum, satisfy the requirements of Section 12.3.2, to protect itself and the other Party against any claims or liabilities that may arise from the conduct of the Clinical Trials and all other rights and obligations hereunder with insurers with a minimum \"A-\" A.M.

Oxbow and Global each may be referred to from time to time herein as a \"Party\" and collectively as the \"Parties\".    RECITALS    WHEREAS, Oxbow is a world leader in petroleum coke trading, marketing, sales, and shipping; and    WHEREAS, Global Energy is a world leader in petroleum coke gasification, having optimized operations of the leading petroleum coke gasification technology, EGAS\u2122 technology, at its Wabash gasification facility in Indiana; and    WHEREAS, Oxbow leases a marine terminal site in Texas City, Texas which it believes to be well-suited for installation of petroleum coke gasification technology, in that gasification would optimize Oxbow's flexibility in the sale and use of petroleum coke currently stored on the site, which could be converted into pipeline SNG or hydrogen, as well as being shipped onward to Oxbow's traditional petroleum coke customers; and    WHEREAS, Global Energy is a leader in the development and permitting of gasification facilities, and currently is the only gasification facility owner/operator with permits to construct new gasification facilities (specifically, its Lima and Westfield Projects); and    WHEREAS, the Parties believe that an alliance as described in this Agreement will prove mutually beneficial;    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:    AGREEMENT    1. Purchase of Shares. Global Energy shall issue and sell to Oxbow, and Oxbow shall purchase from Global Energy, on the Closing Date, Twenty-Five Thousand (25,000) common shares of Global Energy (the \"Shares\"), on the following terms and conditions, and subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6 hereof:    (a) Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Shares shall be Five Million and No/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00), or $200.00 per Share.      1\n\n\n\n\n\n    (b) Payment. Payment of the Purchase Price shall be made on the Closing Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds to Global Energy, as applicable, at the applicable account designated by Global Energy, as follows:                                           Bank:     PNC Bank, N.A.

(c) Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 6, the closing of the purchase of the Shares (the \"Closing\") shall take place at 11:00 a.m., on December 22, 2006 (such date of closing referred to herein as the \"Closing Date\") at the offices of Oxbow, 1601 Forum Place, Suite 1400, West Palm Beach, Florida 33401, unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. At the Closing, Oxbow shall pay to Global Energy the Purchase Price and Global Energy shall deliver to Oxbow a stock certificate evidencing the issuance to Oxbow of the Shares. The Closing shall be deemed effective as of 12:01 a.m. U.S. Eastern Standard Time, on the Closing Date.    2. Strategic Alliance. The Parties hereby form a strategic alliance having the following key elements:    (a) Preferred Suppliers. Oxbow and Global Energy hereby designate one another as their preferred suppliers of certain goods and services, as follows:    (i) Oxbow shall be the preferred petroleum coke supplier to petroleum coke gasification projects owned or controlled by Global Energy.    (ii) Oxbow shall be a preferred supplier of coal, coal fines, gob or waste coal products (collectively, \"Coal\") to gasification projects owned or controlled by Global Energy.    (iii) Global Energy shall be the preferred gasification technology supplier to petroleum coke gasification projects majority owned or controlled by Oxbow.    (iv) Global Energy shall be the preferred gasification project operator for petroleum coke gasification projects at sites majority owned or controlled by Oxbow.      2\n\n\n\n\n\n    (b) Further Cooperation. The Parties also agree to cooperate in good faith as follows in furtherance of their strategic alliance:    (i) Oxbow will identify Oxbow petroleum coke related sites for collaboration with Global Energy.    (ii) Global Energy will identify Global Energy petroleum coke related sites for collaboration with Oxbow.    The obligations of the Parties pursuant to this Section 2 are subject to continued demonstrated performance and their mutual agreement on the schedule, pricing, financing, economics and other terms and conditions applicable to any such project.    3. Lima Project. In addition to the strategic alliance described in Section 2 of this Agreement, the parties specifically agree to the following with respect to Global Energy's proposed Lima, Ohio gasification project (the \"Lima Project\"):    (a) Investment by Oxbow. Oxbow will make a investment (the \"Lima Investment\") in the company which owns the Lima Project (the \"Lima Project Company\") in the amount of [*], as consideration for obtaining the fuel supply management agreement for the Lima Project and the other revenues and benefits described in this Section 3. Oxbow's obligation to make this investment would be subject to:    (i) Oxbow obtaining the consent of its existing lenders; and    (ii) Global Energy securing one or more firm written commitments in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Oxbow for at least Two Hundred Seventeen Million and No/100 Dollars ($217,000,000.00) of equity funding for the Lima Project, or in the alternative, evidence demonstrating that Global has available cash of Two Hundred Seventeen Million and No/100 Dollars ($217,000,000.00) in its account.    (iii) Global Energy providing evidence satisfactory to Oxbow in its reasonable discretion that it has secured the right to purchase the site for the Lima Project from the City of Lima, Ohio for a purchase price of One Million Five Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($1,500,000.00).    (b) Revenues and Benefits to Oxbow. If Oxbow makes the Lima Investment:    (i) Oxbow will receive four percent (4%) of the Lima Project's pre-tax project cash flow after debt service and operation and maintenance (\"O&M\") expenses. The Lima Project Company's obligation to make such payment would be subject to satisfaction of the same lender covenants which will apply to distributions to equity investors in the Lima Project; and      3\n\n\n\n\n\n    (ii) Oxbow will receive two percent (2%) of those non-O&M revenues of Global Energy's affiliate, Gasification Engineering Corporation, Inc. (\"GEC\") related to the Lima Project (e.g., any of the $200 million EPC reserves/construction contingency which is not spent).    (iii) Oxbow will have a seat on the Board of Directors of GEC or any subsidiary or affiliate of GEC which is responsible for the engineering, procurement and construction (\"EPC\") contract for the Lima Project.    (c) Fuel Management and Supply Agreement. In addition, if Oxbow makes the Lima Investment, Oxbow and Global Energy will enter into a fuel management and supply agreement (the \"Fuel Management and Supply Agreement\") for all fuel to be utilized by the Lima Project, which would include the following material provisions:    (i) Oxbow will manage all fuel coke and Coal supply and logistics for the Lima Project.    (ii) Oxbow will be paid a management fee of One Million and No/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) per year, such fee to be paid irrespective of actual Coal or petroleum coke use by the Lima Project.    (iii) As fuel supply manager, Oxbow will receive a base commission of $0.12 per MMBTU consumed by the Lima Project, independent of fuel type (the \"Base Commission\"). As an incentive to obtain the lowest cost of fuel throughout the life of the Lima Project, the Lima Project Company would receive two-thirds (2/3) of any cost savings below $1.07 per MMBTU delivered to the project (such price, the \"Price Basis\"), escalated each year beginning in 2009 in accordance with increases in the Consumer Price Index, and Oxbow would receive one- third (1/3) of any such cost savings. Should the price of fuel delivered to the Lima Project be above the Price Basis, the commission will be reduced on a sliding scale according to the following formula:    C= BC+(PB-PI)*0.1094    Where:    C = commission  BC = Base Commission  PI = price invoiced per MMBTU  PB = Price Basis per MMBTU    However, the commission will never be less than $0.05 per MMBTU regardless of fuel price.

THE DIET CENTER.\n\n         1.1 Women.com will name an area, in which eDiets content will be published (such area, the \"Diet Center\"). Links (presented as Diet Center logos) to the Diet Center will be located on three Women.com channels (the Fitness Channel www.women.com/fitness; the Health Channel www.women.com/health; and the Food Channel www.women.com/food) and two subchannels within such channels to be determined in accordance with Exhibit B hereto. The first page of the Diet Center (the \"Gateway Page\") will have the look and feel of the Women.com Sites as specified in Exhibit A hereto. The Diet Center shall be branded with an icon that includes the eDiets logo. There will be no Women.com or eDiets registration required to enter and use the Gateway Page of the Diet Center. Women.com and eDiets will mutually agree upon the content and logo of the Gateway Page, including the display, appearance and placement of the Diet Center's logo, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including the specifications set forth on Exhibit A hereto, prior to the launch date of the Diet Center (the \"Launch Date\"). eDiets and Women.com shall work together in good faith in order to implement such design and development and the continued enhancement of the Diet Center.\n\n         1.2 Women.com shall store and maintain the Gateway Page on, and serve the Gateway Page from, server(s) located on Women.com's premises or the premises of Women.com's third party web host. eDiets shall store and maintain the Diet Center beneath the Gateway Page, and serve the Diet Center beneath the Gateway Page from, server(s) located on eDiets' premises or the premises of eDiets' third party web host.

If at any time during the Term of this Agreement, eDiets reasonably believes that the inclusion of such back buttons has a material negative effect upon the rate at which users of the Diet Center register to become members of eDiets or convert into registered participants of the services offered by eDiets on the Diet Center (the \"Negative Effect\"), eDiets may conduct a one (1) month test of the effect of such back buttons which may include the exclusion of the back button. If such test verifies the Negative Effect of the back button(s) to the Women.com Site, eDiets may remove any such back buttons.\n\n         1.3 Except as set forth in Section 1.2  [Women], eDiets will have sole responsibility for providing and maintaining at its own expense the Diet Center beneath the Gateway Page. eDiets and Women.com will work together regarding the on-going design and maintenance of the Diet Center.\n\n         1.4 Each party shall bear its own expenses related to its responsibilities under this Section 1.\n\n2.

In the event that eDiets fails, within five (5) days after submission by Women.com, to provide Women.com with necessary revisions thereto, such failure shall be deemed to be approval of Women.com's edits.
