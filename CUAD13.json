The parties wish to produce a series of recorded compilations and companion song books featuring praise and worship repertoires, which will be co-branded and co-marketed throughout the world. Now, therefore, the parties agree as follows:\n\n1.       Product Concept and Creation.\n\n      a.       Product description. The product to be created under the                   series trade name \"Songs 4 Worship\" will be a praise and                   worship continuity series, with each volume in the series                   containing approximately 22 songs.

In the event of a                   suspension owing to a \"force majeure,\" which suspension                   exceeds six (6) consecutive months, the non-suspending party                   may terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days written notice                   to other, but only if such \"force majeure\" does not affect a                   substantial portion of the United States recording industry or                   the suspension is not lifted by the suspending party within                   ten (10) days of the receipt of the written notice from the                   other party.\n\n10.

Pending the          determination and settlement of any such claim, demand or action, the          non-indemnifying party will have the right, at its election, to          withhold payment to you of any monies otherwise payable hereunder, in          an amount reasonably related to that claim, demand or action, and its          estimated costs and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys'          fees) in connection therewith.\n\n11.      Notices. The respective addresses for each party for all purposes          hereunder are set forth on page 1 hereof, unless and until notice of a          different address is received by the party being notified of a change          of address. All notices will be in writing and will either be served by          personal delivery (to an officer of each company), by mail or by          telegraph, in each case with all charges prepaid. Notices will be          deemed effective when personally delivered, mailed certified mail or          similar delivery requiring a signature upon delivery, all charges          prepaid, except for notice of change of address, which will be          effective only when received by the party notified.

Either party may, at its election, assign this Agreement or          any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations hereunder, in          whole or in part, to any person, firm or corporation owning or          acquiring all or a substantial portion of its assets, to any person,          firm or corporation that is related to it as an affiliate,\n\n                                    7\n\n10\n\n      subsidiary or otherwise, or to any person, firm or corporation into          which or with it might merge or consolidate.

If any part of this Agreement will be determined to be invalid                   or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or by                   any other legally constituted body having jurisdiction to make                   such determination, the remainder of this Agreement will                   remain in full force and effect.\n\n      d.

STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT Effective Date: April 17, 2017   THIS STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT (this \"Agreement\"), is entered into by and between Lion Biotechnologies, Inc., with a place of business located at 999 Skyway Road, Suite 150, San Carlos, CA 94070 (\"LBIO\"), and The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, with a place of business located at 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Houston, TX 77030 (\"MD Anderson\"), a member institution of The University of Texas System (\"System\"), as of the date set forth above (the \"Effective Date\"). MD Anderson and LBIO are hereinafter individually referred to as a \"Party\" and are collectively known as the \"Parties\".   WHEREAS, as a comprehensive cancer research, treatment, and educational center, MD Anderson undertakes research and experimental activities in a variety of disciplines; and   WHEREAS, the Parties hereby wish to establish a collaboration (\"Collaboration\") with respect to the performance of one or more research studies to be conducted pursuant to this Agreement (each such study, a \"Study\", and collectively the \"Studies\", and the activities to be performed with respect to the Studies collectively, the \"Research\").   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, LBIO and MD Anderson hereby agree to be legally bound as follows:   1. Governance.   1.1 Joint Steering Committee. The Parties will establish a joint steering committee (\"JSC\") of equal representation, comprised of three members from each Party, with the members of each Party collectively having one vote on all matters to be decided upon by the JSC. Each Party can appoint and replace its members in the JSC at its own discretion through timely written notice to the other Party. The Principal Investigators for each Study (as defined hereinafter) shall attend each JSC meeting, except in the event of exigent circumstances that do not permit such attendance.   1.2 JSC Meetings. The JSC will have meetings (either in person, by teleconference or via electronic means) at least quarterly. At least one meeting per year will be conducted in person or by videoconference (including the kick-off meeting), with the location alternating between a site a selected by LBIO and a site selected by MD Anderson. LBIO will choose the location of the first such in-person meeting. Subject to Section 1.4 below, the JSC will decide on matters by unanimous vote; provided, however, that no action may lawfully be taken at any meeting unless at least two members from each Party (including for this purpose any proxy member appointed as provided below) are present at the meeting. If a member of the JSC is unable to attend a meeting, he or she may appoint, in writing, a proxy to participate and vote in his or her stead.\n\n 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  1.3 JSC Responsibilities. The main task of the JSC will be to oversee the Collaboration. In order to achieve the objectives of the Collaboration, the JSC will oversee each Study under the Collaboration. The JSC will provide technical, scientific, clinical, and regulatory guidance regarding the Studies and will be responsible for monitoring progress of the Studies. In addition, the JSC will be responsible for coordinating resolution of problems arising in the Studies or in the Collaboration as a whole. Additional members can be invited by the JSC on a case by case basis should discussion of certain topics require so; provided, that such members will be subject to obligations of confidentiality and non-use at least as strict as those set forth in Section 5 below.   1.4 Dispute Resolution. Decisions regarding Study design, changes and/or additions to the initially-agreed Protocols must be unanimous, with each Party exercising one vote each, and in the absence of such unanimity the status quo shall be maintained. For all other matters before the JSC, a unanimous decision, with each Party exercising one vote, is required; provided, that, if unanimity cannot be achieved regarding such other matters, then LBIO's chief executive officer may make the decision on behalf of the JSC, provided that LBIO's chief executive officer will first make a good faith effort to consult with a designated executive at MD Anderson to resolve such matter.   2. Performance of Studies.   2.1 Studies.   (a) During the Term (as defined below), LBIO and MD Anderson may periodically agree to collaborate with respect to the performance of one or more Studies. In connection with each Study, the Parties shall execute, as applicable, a Study-specific clinical trial agreement or a pre-clinical work order where a clinical trial is not being conducted (each, a \"Study Order\"). Study Orders shall be numbered sequentially and, when executed, appended to this Agreement and made a part hereof. The first three Study Orders, when completed, will be incorporated into this Agreement as Exhibit I, Exhibit II, and Exhibit III, and the Studies that are the subject of such Study Orders are also referred to herein as the \"Initial Studies\". Each Study Order shall detail the specifics of the Study to be performed under such Study Order including (i) a detailed Study-specific protocol (\"Protocol\") that will be developed jointly by the Parties working together in good faith and (ii) any Study-specific resources or support to be provided by LBIO, including any financial consideration (\"Collaboration Funding\", but excluding financial support associated with the Initial Studies to the extent addressed in Section 4 of this Agreement). Any revisions or amendments to a Study Order or Protocol shall be implemented, if at all, solely in accordance with the terms of the relevant Study Order and shall be subject to the approval of the JSC. The Parties acknowledge and agree that MD Anderson will be the \"sponsor\" of the Initial Studies that are clinical studies, as defined at 21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 50.3(f) and 312.3(b), and will be the holder of the investigational new drug applications (INDs) submitted to the FDA (as defined hereinafter) for such Initial Studies.   (b) In the event of any conflict of any terms of this Agreement and the terms of a Study Order, the terms of this Agreement shall govern, unless the Study Order specifically and expressly supersedes this Agreement with respect to a specific term, and then only with respect to the particular Study Order and specific term. If there is any discrepancy or conflict between the terms contained in a Protocol and this Agreement and/or the relevant Study Order, the terms of the Protocol shall govern and control with respect to clinical matters and the terms of this Agreement and/or the relevant Study Order shall govern and control with respect to all other matters (e.g., legal and financial matters).\n\n 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  2.2 Investigators.   (a) Principal Investigator. Each Study Order will identify the individual that will serve as the \"Principal Investigator\" for the relevant Study at MD Anderson and shall be responsible for MD Anderson's administration and supervision of its portion of such Study. If the originally named Principal Investigator becomes unable or unwilling to continue a Study for any reason, MD Anderson shall propose a substitute Principal Investigator with comparable qualifications within two business days of MD Anderson becoming aware of such event. If the proposed candidate is not available or is not acceptable to LBIO, LBIO may terminate the applicable Study in accordance with Section 8.3(ii).   (b) MD Anderson and Principal Investigator may appoint one or more collaborating physicians (\"Sub-Investigators\") to participate in a Study. Such Sub-Investigators shall work under the supervision of, shall report to and be the sole responsibility of Principal Investigator, and Principal Investigator and MD Anderson shall each ensure that all Sub-Investigators undertake all activity related to the Study in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the applicable Study Order, and the Protocol.   (c) On a Study Order-by-Study Order basis, in the event that a Principal Investigator leaves or is removed from MD Anderson (or is otherwise unwilling or unavailable to direct the applicable Study in accordance with this Agreement and the applicable Study Order), then MD Anderson shall, as soon as practicable but in any event within two (2) business days of such event, provide written notice of such event to LBIO. Any subsequently appointed principal investigator must be approved, in writing in advance, by LBIO and such new principal investigator shall be required to agree to all the terms and conditions of the applicable Study Order and this Agreement and to sign each such document as evidence of such agreement (although failure to so sign will not relieve such new principal investigator from abiding with all the terms and conditions of the applicable Study Order and this Agreement). If LBIO does not approve of the new principal investigator, or the new principal investigator does not sign this Agreement, then LBIO may terminate the applicable Study Order in accordance with Section 8.3(ii).   2.3 Performance; Compliance with Law.   (a) MD Anderson shall, and shall cause each of its employees, agents, contractors, and subcontractors performing Research activities or other obligations under this Agreement, including the Principal Investigator (collectively, \"Representatives\") to, conduct such activities, and use, store and handle all materials used in the performance of activities under this Agreement and each Study Order, or cause the same to be done, in accordance with (i) all applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines, including, to the extent applicable, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\"FFCDA\"); the anti-kickback and related provisions of the Social Security Act; the Public Health Services Act; the regulations promulgated by the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"), including 21 C.F.R.

LBIO agrees to commit funding in an amount not to exceed $14,211,864.00 for the performance of the Studies during the Term (collectively, \"Initial Funding\"), with the Initial Funding specifically allocated as follows: (a) $[* * *] for an upfront payment, and a minimum of $[* * *] for enrollment and treatment of a minimum of 40 patients in the Study described in Exhibit I (i.e., the Minimum Enrollment Target as defined in Exhibit 1) or up to $[* * *] (an \"Individual Study Budget\") for enrollment and treatment of up to 60 patients in the Study described in Exhibit I (i.e., the Maximum Enrollment Target as defined in Exhibit 1); (b) $[* * *] (which shall also be considered an Individual Study Budget) for enrollment, manufacturing of product, and treatment of 30 patients in the Study described in Exhibit II; and (c) $[* * *] for the Study described in Exhibit III. LBIO shall pay the Initial Funding in accordance with Section 4.3. For clarity, the Initial Funding is Collaboration Funding. MD Anderson agrees that all costs of this Collaboration, with the sole exceptions of any costs to supply clinical-grade aldesleukin and 4-1BB agonist for use in the expansion of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (\"TILs\"), and in the case of aldesleukin, for use in the treatment of patients, are included in the Initial Funding. Subject to the foregoing exceptions, MD Anderson shall be solely responsible for any costs it incurs in performing the Studies that are in excess of the Initial Funding.   4.2 Collaboration Funding Generally. MD Anderson shall use the Collaboration Funding solely to conduct the applicable Study and MD Anderson shall be responsible for managing cash flow between payments. It is understood and agreed that the Collaboration Funding shall cover all administrative, IRB review, patient recruitment, and all other fees, costs and expenses of MD Anderson and any of its Representatives for the conduct of the Studies or the provision of equipment or services to facilitate the Studies, and that no other form of compensation shall be paid to MD Anderson in connection with the Studies except as otherwise may be specifically and mutually agreed upon by the Parties in writing.   4.3 Payments. LBIO shall pay the Initial Funding to MD Anderson as follows. An upfront payment of $[* * *] (the \"Upfront Payment\") shall be invoiced by MDACC on the Effective Date. The remainder of the Initial Funding shall be paid as follows:   (a) In the event that the Study Order covers the performance of a clinical trial, funding shall be invoiced based on Study patient enrollment as follows, based on the Maximum Enrollment Target as defined in each Study Order:\n\nMilestone (on Study Order-by-Study Order basis)\n\n Payment (% of the Individual Study  Budget) to be provided in  connection with such Study Order* Enrollment of [* * *]% of the target patient enrollment as set forth in the applicable Protocol  [* * *]%\n\nEnrollment of [* * *]% of the target patient enrollment as set forth in the applicable Protocol  [* * *]%\n\nEnrollment of [* * *]% of the target patient enrollment as set forth in the applicable Protocol  [* * *]%\n\nEnrollment of final patient as set forth in the applicable Protocol  [* * *]% Receipt by LBIO of both (a) the final clinical study report and (b) all raw clinical data (anonymized and without including any identifying information)\n\n [* * *]%\n\n  *With respect to Exhibit 1, the Individual Study Budget shall be the one associated with the Minimum Enrollment Target (as defined in Exhibit 1), and in the event that the Parties move to the Maximum Enrollment Target (as defined in Exhibit 1) then this table shall be applied to the incremental additional patients as if the incremental additional patients constitute their own protocol/budget. For example, if LBIO decides to add ten (10) additional patients to the clinical study in Exhibit 1, each patient will be accrued at $[* * *] per patient, and LBIO will be invoiced for percentage enrollment of these ten (10) patients based on the table above.\n\n 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (b) In the event that the Study Order covers activities other than the performance of a clinical trial, a payment schedule will be set forth in the relevant Study Order.   (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, LBIO may suspend payment if, in LBIO's reasonable opinion after review of the Reports (as defined below), MD Anderson has not been performing the Research diligently and in the manner agreed upon herein.   (d) Upon the occurrence of one of the milestones identified in the table in Section 4.3(a), or described in an applicable Study Order for a non-clinical Study according to Section 4.3(b), MD Anderson shall invoice LBIO for the related payment amount. In each case, invoices shall be itemized, including by reference to Study Order title, and otherwise shall include such supporting documentation as LBIO may reasonably request. LBIO shall pay all undisputed invoices within thirty (30) days of receipt of such invoice.   (e) If the Study described in Exhibit II is not commenced, the portion of the Upfront Payment that would have been applied to that Study ($[* * *]) will be credited by MD Anderson towards the Studies described in Exhibit I and Exhibit III.   (f) All terms and payments of compensation, benefits, and any other conditions of engagement, including payment of taxes, for any person working with Principal Investigator and any other support staff who may be used in the performance of a Study (including any Sub- Investigator) shall be solely a matter between MD Anderson and such individuals.

Each party   agrees that prior to disclosing any PROPRIETARY INFORMATION of the other   party to any such other person, it will obtain from such other person, a written\n\n\n\n- 21 -  TELKOM CONTRACT NO. 076C/01   acknowledgement that he will be bound by the same terms as specified in this   clause 7 with respect to the either party's PROPRIETARY INFORMATION.   7. 7.     TELKOM and SAP AFRICA acknowledge that any disclosure to third parties of   PROPRIETARY INFORMATION may cause immediate and irreparable harm to   the owner of the disclosed PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. Accordingly, each   party agrees to take all reasonable steps and the same protective precautions   and measures to protect the other party's PROPRIETARY INFORMATION from   disclosure to third parties as it would take with its own proprietary and confidential   information.   8.    MODIFICATIONS AND EXTENSIONS:   8. 1.     TELKOM may make modifications and extensions to the SOFTWARE for use on   the DESIGNATED UNIT(S) under the terms set forth in this clause 8.   8. 2.     In the event that TELKOM develops any extension or modification (hereinafter   referred to as \"TELKOM extension\" or \"TELKOM modification\") to the   SOFTWARE, TELKOM shall have all rights, title and interest in such TELKOM   extension or TELKOM modification subject to SAP AFRICA'S rights in the   SOFTWARE. TELKOM agrees, however, that such TELKOM extension or   TELKOM modification will be used solely in connection with TELKOM and its   AFFILIATES' business operations and that such TELKOM extension or TELKOM   modification will not be marketed, licensed or sublicensed, sold, assigned, or   otherwise transferred or made available to any third party or other entity, without   the express prior written consent of SAP AFRICA. TELKOM hereby grants SAP   AFRICA the right of first refusal to any licence to, or assignment of, such   TELKOM extension or TELKOM modification and TELKOM agrees not to dispose.\n\n\n\n- 22 -  TELKOM CONTRACT NO. 076C/01   of or license, its rights thereto to any third party for a consideration not less than,   and upon other terms not less favourable than those initially offered to SAP   AFRICA.   8. 3.   In the event that SAP AFRICA develops jointly with TELKOM for universal   application and jointly funds with TELKOM, any extension or modification to the   licensed SOFTWARE, then save as may otherwise be agreed upon in writing by   SAP AFRICA and TELKOM, such extensions or modifications will be the joint   property of SAP AFRICA and TELKOM provided that   8. 3. 1.    Neither SAP AFRICA nor TELKOM will grant to any third party, either   expressly or impliedly, any rights, title, interest in, or licences to, such jointly   developed modification or extension. It is recorded that TELKOM shall be   entitled to USE such modification and extension on the DESIGNATED   UNIT(S) at the DESIGNATED SITE(S) in accordance with the provisions of   this AGREEMENT.   8. 3. 2.    8. 4.   The parties hereto agree that the granting of any rights, title or interest to   TELKOM in any extension or modification (including TELKOM extensions and   TELKOM modifications) shall not be construed by the parties hereto or any court   of law to mean that SAP AFRICA has granted or given up any rights, title, or   interest in or to SAP AFRICA'S PROPRIETARY INFORMATION or any part   thereof.   8. 5.   TELKOM agrees that it will not modify any third party SOFTWARE provided in   terms of this AGREEMENT, unless expressly authorised in writing by such third   party vendor and SAP AFRICA.\n\n\n\n- 23 -  TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   8. 6.     During such time as SAP AFRICA provides maintenance service to TELKOM in   respect of the SOFTWARE, TELKOM shall not make modifications to the   SOFTWARE without the prior written consent of SAP AFRICA which shall not be   unreasonably withheld.   8. 7.     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein and without prejudice   to SAP AFRICA'S right of pre- emption provided for in clause 8. 2, should a party   (\"the acquiror\") wish to acquire for itself only, the rights (and accompanying   obligations) in and to the jointly developed and funded MODIFICATION OR   EXTENSION, then the acquiror shall pay to the other party (\"the divesting party\")   an amount equal to the market value of such modification or extension.   9.    MAINTENANCE   9. 1     SAP AFRICA shall provide maintenance services in respect of the SOFTWARE   in accordance with the provisions of this AGREEMENT and annexure 2 hereto   (\"Maintenance Service\").

Maintenance Service includes the delivery of   RELEASES and VERSIONS, support via telephone, the correction of defects,   SAP AFRICA'S remote support on-line SOFTWARE services, and those other   services as set out in annexure 2. It is conditional upon TELKOM receiving   Maintenance Service that TELKOM must make all required remote support and   connections to the DESIGNATED UNIT, at its expense, as reasonably requested   by SAP AFRICA. It is recorded that, unless the parties should agree otherwise,   such remote access shall be by a dial - up facility only.   9. 2     The Maintenance Services to be provided by SAP AFRICA shall not include any   services other than those contemplated in clause 9. 1 and those set out in\n\n\n\n- 24 -                                             TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   annexure 2. Maintenance Services will be offered only for the current VERSION   and RELEASE and the immediately preceding VERSION and RELEASE. SAP   AFRICA shall use its best endeavours to provide Maintenance Services in   respect of earlier VERSIONS and/or RELEASES provided that should SAP   AFRICA and its licensors incur material costs in supporting such prior   RELEASES and/or VERSIONS, then the parties shall negotiate with each other,   observing the principles of good faith, to agree upon additional maintenance fees   payable by TELKOM in respect of such prior RELEASES and/or VERSIONS.   9. 3    Upon TELKOM'S request and provided that TELKOM has paid the Maintenance   Fee due to SAP AFRICA, SAP AFRICA shall, deliver new RELEASES and   VERSIONS and related DOCUMENTATION to the DESIGNATED SITES at no *   extra cost to TELKOM. Maintenance Service does not include the delivery of any   SOFTWARE and DOCUMENTATION that SAP AFRICA offers as separate   products and/or which have not been licensed in terms of this AGREEMENT.   9. 4      All other maintenance, consulting or related services not referred to in this clause 9   and/or in annexure 2, shall be agreed upon separately in writing and shall be   subject to agreed additional charges.   Maintenance Fees and Payment   9. 5     As consideration for providing the maintenance services, TELKOM shall pay to   SAP AFRICA an annual fee, that shall be calculated as a percentage of the   agreed License Fee, expressed in USD, for the SOFTWARE as specified in   annexure 1 hereto. Such percentage is stipulated in the annexure 2 hereto   (\"the Maintenance Fee\"). TELKOM shall pay the Maintenance Fee annually in   advance, in ZAR, calculated at the ruling USD: ZAR rate of exchange on the\n\n\n\n- 25 -  TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   date of invoice and otherwise in accordance with the other terms of payment   set out in this AGREEMENT and annexure 2.   9. 6    SAP AFRICA shall be entitled, upon 3 months written notice, to increase the   Maintenance Fee by increasing the percentage upon which the Maintenance   Fee is calculated or, on another basis provided that any increase to the   Maintenance Fee, caused by a combination of increases arising from:   9. 6. 1       inflation; and/or   9. 6. 2       the percentage at which the Maintenance Fee is calculated; and/or   9. 6. 3       USD/ZAR exchange rate movements,   shall not be greater than the annual increase in the South African   Consumer Price Index for all areas for the immediately preceding year (\"the   CPI\"), as published by the Central Statistics Agency of South Africa, or its   successors. However, should the Maintenance Fee not be increased by   the full extent of the CPI for any one year then, future increases to the   Maintenance Fee shall not exceed the difference between the actual   increases to the maintenance fee and the cumulative effect of the annual   increases in the CPI, for the immediately preceding thirty six consecutive   months period.   9. 7    The Maintenance Services may be terminated by TELKOM in writing at   any time upon 3 (three) months prior written notice. Subject to any   accrued rights and obligations, SAP AFRICA shall be entitled to   terminate the provision of Maintenance Services in respect of the   SOFTWARE or any modules thereof in the event of:\n\n\n\n- 26 -                                             TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   9. 7. 1           an unremedied material breach of this AGREEMENT by TELKOM;   and/or   9. 7. 2             should SAP AFRICA, SAP AG or their respective licensors, cease, for   whatever reason, providing such Maintenance Services,   provided that in the latter case, SAP AFRICA and /or SAP AG shall procure   that COMMERCE ONE INC.. Inc. shall provide the Maintenance Service   and any related obligations of SAP Africa when providing Maintenance   Service in terms of this AGREEMENT including, its' obligations arising out   of annexure 3 Any Maintenance Fees paid in advance will be refunded to   TELKOM.   9. 8    Wherever in terms of this AGREEMENT, TELKOM is obliged or required   to provide remote access for whatever reason to SAP AFRICA, then   SAP AFRICA and its representatives, shall comply strictly with   TELKOM\"S internal policies, arrangements and procedures with regard   thereto.   9. 9    SAP AFRICA shall use its best endeavours to meet and comply with the   projected resolution times set out in annexure 2 hereto.   10.     WARRANTY   10. 1    SAP AFRICA warrants that the SOFTWARE will conform to the functional   specifications contained in the DOCUMENTATION on the date of installation of the   SOFTWARE and will perform, when in use without material alteration on the   DESIGNATED UNIT in accordance with the functional specifications set forth in   the DOCUMENTATION.\n\n\n\n- 27 -                                             TELKOM CONTRACT NO. 076C/01   10. 2    SAP AFRICA'S warranty aforesaid is subject to TELKOM providing SAP AFRICA   necessary access, including remote access, to the SOFTWARE and, if necessary,   to the DESIGNATED UNIT and to TELKOM not being in breach of any material   term of this AGREEMENT.   10. 3    TELKOM must specifically identify to SAP AFRICA, the nature of the perceived   SOFTWARE defect and specifically describe the conditions under which the   perceived defect occurs.

SAP AFRICA must exercise its option within 20 days of first becoming aware of the   defect.   11. 2   TELKOM'S remedies for other loss or damages shall be as set out in clauses   11. 34 and 11. 5 below.\n\n\n\n- 30 -                                             TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   11. 3   For the avoidance of doubt, it is recorded that SAP AFRICA will not be liable under   this AGREEMENT for:   11. 3. 1       the MODIFICATION or improvement of the SOFTWARE by TELKOM to fit   the particular requirements of TELKOM; or   11. 3. 2       the correction of any data errors resulting from MODIFICATIONS or   EXTENSIONS by TELKOM or its agents; or   11. 3. 3       the correction of any data errors as a result of misuse of the SOFTWARE by   TELKOM or its agents; or   11. 3. 4       preparation or conversion of data by TELKOM into the form required for use   with the SOFTWARE.   11. 4   Subject to, and without prejudice to the provisions of this clause 11. 1 and clause   10, SAP AFRICA'S liability for any loss or damages of whatever nature or however   arising, that may be suffered by TELKOM or AFFILIATE from USE or license of the   SOFTWARE and irrespective of the number of occurrences giving rise to such   liability, shall be limited to the aggregate of all License Fees paid by TELKOM to   SAP AFRICA in terms of this AGREEMENT, up until the date when such damages   are determined or agreed.   11. 5     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this AGREEMENT, a party   hereto (the \"defaulting party\") shall not be liable for any consequential damage or   loss of whatever nature and/or however caused, that may be suffered by the other   party (the \"innocent party\") other than for consequential loss or damages suffered   by the innocent party caused by the wilful or intentional acts or omissions of the\n\n\n\n- 31 -  TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   defaulting party or any person or entity in respect of whom the defaulting party may   be vicariously liable. However, it is recorded for the avoidance of doubt that if   TELKOM should suffer a loss of revenue as a consequence of the SOFTWARE   failing to conform or perform to its functional specifications, then SAP AFRICA's   revenue share fee shall be decreased accordingly.   11. 6   It is agreed that each provision of this AGREEMENT that provides for a limitation   of liability, or warranties or exclusion of damages, is intended by the parties to be   severable and independent of any other provision and to be enforced as such.   11. 7     FAILURE OF MARKETPLACE   11. 7. 1      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this AGREEMENT and in   particular, clause 11. 1, in instances where the module of the SOFTWARE   constituting a portion of the Marketplace known as MarketSet 2. 0 Platform, fails   and cannot be accessed or USED by TELKOM and BUSINESS THIRD PARTIES   on the DESIGNATED UNIT and/or such other DESIGNATED UNIT where the   SOFTWARE is installed for disaster recovery or back-up USE, and such failure is   caused solely by a failure in the SOFTWARE to perform in accordance with the   specifications set out in the DOCUMENTATION and should the Marketplace   remain unable to be accessed or USED by TELKOM and/or BUSINESS THIRD   PARTIES for a continuous period of 72 hours, commencing from the time when   such failure is logged as a Priority 1 error (as defined in annexure 2) with SAP   AFRICA as a SOFTWARE problem and SAP AFRICA is unable to provide a   solution or resolution within the said 72 hours, then TELKOM shall be entitled to   terminate this AGREEMENT and claim damages limited as provided for in clause   11. 4.\n\n\n\n- 32 -  TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   11. 7. 2       The remedy granted to TELKOM in terms of clause 11. 7. 1 shall only be available   until statistics with regard to the stability of the Marketset 2. 0 Platform has   reached a level that is acceptable to Telkom. Such acceptance shall be based on   market norms for the availability levels of Marketset software similar to or the   same as Marketset considered to be mission critical, which can be established via   independent market research, which shall be the responsibility and for the   account of SAP.

The Maintenance Fee shall be calculated at 17% of the License fee stipulated in          annexure 1 for the license of the SOFTWARE.   2.     MAINTENANCE SERVICES   SAP Africa (\"SAP\") endeavours to provide the highest quality support and to ensure system stability throughout the life cycle of the Software solution. TELKOM will benefit through a lower total cost of ownership and will, in the future, experience an optimal usage of system resources and protection of existing investments.            7 x 24h Support Worldwide   SAP Customer Support delivers help for software problems in a fast and competent manner. SAP provides a 7 x 24h Support availability for messages with 'very high' priority using the 'Follow-the-Sun' model. At any given time of day an expert will be at hand to provide advice.   All Support centres are linked through a unique Support infrastructure, ensuring that all information provided to SAP is on hand regardless where or when.\n\n\n\n- 58 -     TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   Software Maintenance   Software Maintenance includes the further improvement of the software, as well as the continuous adaptation of the software to new database and operating system versions.  Each new release contains solutions to all known software errors.   Delivery of Functional Enhancements and Updates to the R/3 Software   SAP and its Licensors continuously enhance and improve the Software to ensure that Licensees customers always have the latest technology and business functions (e. g. functionality supporting the introduction of the Euro). SAP ensures that customers always receive the latest release of the R/3 software as soon as it becomes available.    Integrated Support for SAP and Partner Products   SAP maintains Collaborative Support Agreements with SAP Partners who have provided Licensees with hardware, operating system and database platforms to ensure seamless support. Should a Licensee request SAP require the involvement of the respective partner, SAP has established interfaces and procedures to do so.    Access to 'SAP's Frontend (formerly: OSS)   SAP'sFrontend is a quick and user-friendly interface for communication between customers and SAP. Features include:   - Access to the Software Support Package repository for downloads   - Database access to individual problem solutions for downloads   - Knowledge Database access to a wealth of information on the use of the Software   - Electronic notification about important information (HotNews)   - Access to SAP's request handling process.   Support Services   The requirement for deriving the full benefit from SAP's Global Support Network is a remote connection from the customer's Software System to SAP's Frontend. This enables the efficient usage of SAP's portfolio of Remote Services and will enable customers to work with the SAP Support experts whenever required and in particular, at the start of their\n\n\n\n- 59 -     TELKOM CONTRACT NO. 076C/01   implementation. Also, a remote connection is a prerequisite for 7 x 24h support for priority 1 messages.   Under the TeamSAP Support maintenance agreement, SAP Support deals with problem messages pertaining to:   - An error in the software   - An error in the software causes subsequent errors   - There are problems when implementing corrections   - There is no training or documentation available   - The functions are not logical   - The software ergonomics has flaws   Messages of this nature are responded to in writing via SAP's Frontend.   Any other messages are termed consulting issues and may be processed by either SAP's Remote Consulting department, the customer's implementation consultants or SAP consultants. This service is, however, priced separately and is not within scope of the maintenance agreement. Messages of this nature usually concern:   -  Processing logic of the software, the business processes and customising (questions  regarding working with transactions, programs and screens, the contents of screens  and  pr in touts ,   e tc .   )   - Administration or tuning of the SAP System, of the database or the operating system   - Errors caused by a modification of the system   - A solution is clear from the short text or from the help text of the system error   Maintenance Service Levels   Optimum support with fast reaction times is the cornerstone of SAP's Support organisation. SAP's Support process uses a three-tier Support structure:    Local Support (in 50 countries worldwide)   Local Support Centres at SAP subsidiaries are the local contact points for customers. During usual working hours, the Local Support Centres handle all inquiries relating to support in the language of the respective country and, if necessary, forward them to the\n\n\n\n-60-    TELKOM CONTRACT NO. 076C/01    appropriate local partner or the nearest Regional Support Centre. Most inquiries are entered via SAP 's Frontend which offers all the advantages of automatic dispatching.    Regional Support (more than 400 Support professionals in four Regional Support Centres)   Regional Support Centres are located in Walldorf, Germany (Europe/Africa), Philadelphia, USA (Americas), Singapore (Asia-Pacific) and Tokyo, Japan (North East Asia). These Centres are responsible for processing support inquiries and also form part of the 7 x 24h support network. According to the 'FoIlow-the-Sun' principle, inquiries received outside normal working hours are automatically forwarded to the Regional Support Centre that is currently active. Another task is the co-ordination of regional partners in their co-operation with SAP customers.    Development Support (Europe, Americas, Asia)   SAP Africa's Local Support Centre supports all SAP customers in the Southern Africa/Sub- Sahara region. In the event of SAP Africa being unable to respond timeously or effectively, the support query will be elevated to COMMERCE ONE INC.. Inc. consultants, in which event, SAP Africa shall use its best endeavours to respond timeously in accordance with the service levels stipulated in the table below.   The Quality Management processes implemented throughout the SAP Support organisation are certified globally according to the international standard ISO 9002.   The workflow between the support levels is defined in an internal Support Level Agreement (SLA) and SAP's Support Process Monitoring team ensures that requests are forwarded smoothly between the support levels. SAP Africa, SAP AG and their respective licensors shall use their best endeavours and efforts to ensure that the below mentioned Initial Reaction Times and Projected Resolution Times (\"PRT\") are achieved in 80% of all cases;   Priority   Very High (1)   High (2)   Medium (3)   Low (4)   Initial Reaction Time   (IRT)   30 minutes   2 hours   4 hours   8 hours   Projected Resolution Time   (PRT)   1 day   3 days   7 days   1 4 days   Priority 1: d, h, min = days, hours, minutes in actual time Priority 2, 3, 4: d, h, min = days, hours, minutes during office hours\n\n\n\n- 61 -     TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   The initial reaction time (IRT) is the time elapsed between message receipt at SAP (\"Send to SAP\" in SAP Service System) and initial contact with the customer or change of the message status.   The Projected Resolution Time (PRT) is the time elapsed between IRT and providing a solution.   Priorities of messages are defined as follows:    Very High or Priority 1   A message with priority \"Very high\" is justified when critical restrictions in day-to-day operations are encountered. Critical tasks, especially time-critical jobs, cannot be performed, due to a total system shutdown or a malfunction in a main function of the production SAP system.   This message requires immediate processing, as the malfunction can result in serious losses.    High or Priority 2   A message with priority \"High\" is justified when serious restrictions in day-to-day operations are encountered. Necessary tasks cannot be performed due to a malfunction or failed function in the Software that is urgently required in the current situation.   The message requires rapid processing, because the continuing malfunction could cause a serious interruption in the entire production system.    Medium or Priority 3   A message with priority \"Medium\" is justified when restrictions in day-to-day operations are encountered. This is caused by a malfunction or failed functionality in the system.    Low or Priority 4   A message with priority \"Low\" is justified when day-to-day operations are not affected or only affected in a minor fashion. This is caused by a malfunction or failed functionality in the system that is not used daily or is only used rarely.   (Problem situations in test systems will normally result in a priority that is one level lower than the identical problem in a production system).\n\n\n\n- 62 -     TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   On the anniversary of this AGREEMENT, the parties shall enter into discussions and   negotiations for the purposes of reviewing the aforestated maintenance service level terms,   more particularly, the related commercial terms thereof including, the maintenance fee and/or   percentages; the response, processing and resolution times; the penalties that may be   payable by SAP Africa and/or its licensors for failing to comply with such times and other   aspects of the maintenance services. The parties acknowledge that the market for the   SOFTWARE in South Africa is limited and that therefor it may be difficult to ascertain market   conditions for the purposes of reviewing such commercial and related terms. Accordingly,   the parties shall take cognisance of market conditions in other countries where the   SOFTWARE is being used. Should the parties be unable to agree upon any such   amendments within 30 days from the anniversary date, then such dispute shall be referred   for determination by the Arbitration Foundation of Southern Africa (\"AFSA\") in accordance   with the rules of AFSA and to an arbitrator appointed by the Chairperson of AFSA upon   application by either party. The arbitrator shall upon request of either party, appoint a   suitably qualified expert to assist him in determining the dispute. Except in the case of   manifest error, the arbitrators' ruling shall be final and binding upon the parties but shall be   without prejudice to a party's other rights and obligations arising from the AGREEMENT.\n\n\n\n- 6 3 -    TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01     Customer Message Support   The process of customer message support is the interface between development and service. The process steps that impact upon the SLA are customer message recording, preliminary checking, search for relevant error notes (known problem solution), and problem analysis.   Life Cycle of a Customer Message   Refer to accompanying PDF for diagram    Telkom customers can access the SAP's Frontend or SAPNet-Web Frontend and create their own requests and messages. Customer requests and messages that are received in writing via fax (+27 11 2356004) are first processed by the support facility of the Local Support Centre and then recorded for further processing in SAP's internal customer support system. A request or message is automatically assigned to an administrator in the SAP support organization (Local Support and Regional Support for the Software) based on the components assigned to it.   Performing preliminary checks, searching for troubleshooting information   The processor first checks whether the problem report is complete, and whether an entry has already been made in the system containing a solution to the reported problem. This search is conducted semi-automatically in SAP's support system. If an entry is found containing a solution to the problem, then the person who had submitted the problem report is notified in writing via SAPNet and the problem is closed for SAP.   Problem Analysis   If, following preliminary analysis, the Local Support level decides that the problem must be handled by an expert in the respective component, the problem is passed on to the Regional\n\n\n\n- 64 -     TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   Support level. If the problem involves a program error or if the processor cannot find a solution despite intensive analysis, he or she transfers it to the Development Support level. The responsibility for Development Support lies with the user departments of the development areas.   If no relevant error note (known solution) exists, the customer shall provide SAP with sufficient test time and support, as an attempt is made to reproduce the reported problem and to determine whether it is a problem with the software (at SAP or in the customer's system, provided that the latter does not negatively affect the customer's operations). If this reproduction of the problem is not possible, the next time the problem occurs, additional analyses are performed to narrow down the source of the problem. In the meantime, the problem receives the status of \"customer action\" in the support system. If special handling by an expert is required, then it is relayed to Development Support.   Escalation Management   In the event of SAP's Support Management deciding that the standard support processes are insufficient to solve a critical customer situation (problems as described in point 2 above) a formal escalation process is invoked.   During this process, SAP will assign the required SAP personnel to the customer remotely (via a remote connection) and/or on site, as appropriate. These resources will be under the direct supervision of SAP's management and the customer will not incur any costs.   A formal de-escalation process, involving an assigned Customer Services Manager, will take place once the critical issue has been resolved.   During the implementation phase prior to the SOFTWARE being installed, SAP AFRICA and TELKOM will negotiate with each other to discuss and agree upon an appropriate detailed escalation process for the Maintenance Services that SAP AFRICA and its licensors will provide and that will apply during the said implementation phase and the \"go-live\" stage. The parties shall also determine an escalation process that is appropriate for TELKOM'S needs and business requirements when USING the SOFTWARE.\n\n\n\n-65-    TELKOM CONTRACTN0. 076C/01   THUS DONE AND SIGNED at  WOODMEAD  by SYSTEMS APPLICATIONS PRODUCTS   (AFRICA) (PROPRIETARY) LIMITED    on this 31st day of  March 2001    /S/                  /S/                                                   (who warrants his authority to so sign)   For:  TELKOM  SOUTH AFRICA LIMITED             (who warrants his authority to so sign)   /s/                                                                THUS DONE AND SIGNED at  Pretoria by the TELKOM SOUTH AFRICA LIMITED    on this 31st day of  March 2001 in the presence of the undersigned witnesses       AS WITNESSES     Signature         /S/        Signature         /S/\n\n\n\n- 66 -     TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   ANNEXURE 3   to   AGREEMENT   between   SYSTEMS APPLICATION PRODUCTS (AFRICA) (PTY) LTD   with   TELKOM SOUTH AFRICA LIMITED   1.

Mutual Obligations.\n\n     (a) The parties agree and acknowledge that, in addition to the rights granted or to be granted to the parties herein, certain other rights to software source code, object code and documentation, and trademarks and service marks related thereto, are described on Exhibit M.\n\n     (b) The parties acknowledge and agree that as of the Closing Date, the UK mainframe environment, consisting of mainframe computer hardware (\"Mainframe Hardware\") and certain third party software (\"OEM Software\"), currently consists of three (3) logical partitions (\"LPARs\"), two (2) of which are shared between Equifax and Certegy. The parties acknowledge and agree that certain OEM Software (\"MIPS-Based Software\") being used on the Mainframe Hardware contains limitations based upon the number of millions of instructions per second (\"MIPS\") performed; other OEM Software (\"CPU-Based Software\") being used on the Mainframe Hardware contains limitations based upon CPU group ratings. The parties also acknowledge and agree that they have previously determined the number of MIPS available, for each party, in excess of the current combined MIPS usage, in connection with the MIPS-Based Software (\"Projected MIPS\"), and in connection with the CPU-Based Software (\"Overhead MIPS\"), both as set forth on Exhibit N. With respect to the foregoing, the parties hereby agree as follows:\n\n          (i) Certegy agrees that it shall, no later than March 31, 2002, establish, or cause to be established, one or more new and separate LPAR(s) and that Certegy shall no longer share any LPAR with Equifax. Certegy shall be responsible for paying any and all additional software license fees, service fees, fees related to hardware, or other similar fees incurred to establish the new LPAR(s) and to migrate from the existing to the new LPAR(s). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if the deadline for LPAR separation is not met by Certegy prior to March 31, 2002, any costs or fees, including all\n\n\n\n\n\nfees, costs or expenses incurred as a result of\n\n                                       18\n\nincreased capacity or speed requirements or otherwise, incurred by either party due to the non-separation shall be borne by Certegy.\n\n          (ii) If either party, prior to or at the time of the complete separation of LPARs (described in subsection (i) above), exceeds its respective Projected MIPS for any year, and, thereafter, any of the MIPS-Based Software is required, under the terms of the respective software licenses, to be upgraded to allow usage of the additional MIPS, the party first exceeding its respective Projected MIPS (\"Triggering Party\") shall bear the full cost and expense of upgrading the MIPS-Based Software licenses (whether or not such party ultimately caused the MIPS limitations to be exceeded). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after an upgrade to a MIPS-Based Software license is purchased, if the non-Triggering Party exceeds its Projected MIPS during a respective year, such non-Triggering Party shall pay the Triggering Party an amount equal to the total cost to the Triggering Party of purchasing the upgrade multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of MIPS used by the non-Triggering Party that exceeds its original Projected MIPS, and the denominator of which is the total number of MIPS permitted or allowable pursuant to the MIPS-Based Software upgrade, but excluding the total number of MIPS permitted prior to the upgrade.\n\n          (iii) If either party, prior to or at the time of the complete separation of LPARs (described in subsection (i) above), exceeds its respective Overhead MIPS for any year, and, thereafter, the CPU-Based Software is required, under the terms of the respective software licenses, to be upgraded to allow usage of the additional MIPS, the party first exceeding its respective Overhead MIPS (\"CPU Triggering Party\") shall bear the full cost and expense of upgrading the CPU-Based Software licenses (whether or not such party ultimately caused the MIPS limitations to be exceeded). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after an upgrade to a CPU-Based Software license is purchased, if the other party (\"non-CPU Triggering Party\") exceeds its Overhead MIPS during a respective year, such non-CPU Triggering Party shall pay the CPU Triggering Party an amount equal to the total cost to the CPU Triggering Party of purchasing the upgrade multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of MIPS used by the non-CPU Triggering Party that exceeds its original Overhead MIPS, and the denominator of which is the total number of MIPS permitted or allowable pursuant to the CPU-Based Software upgrade, but excluding the total number of MIPS permitted prior to the upgrade.\n\n          (iv) The rules related to OEM Software upgrade requirements described in subsections (ii) and (iii) above shall apply in the same manner, before or after the completion of the LPAR separation, with respect to Mainframe Hardware upgrade requirements.\n\n          (v) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Certegy shall cease the use of any software or hardware that is shared between the parties no later than the date which is two (2) years following the Closing Date.\n\n     (c) The parties acknowledge that the Licensed Materials are \"intellectual property\" within the meaning of Section 101 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act and shall be subject to Section 365(n) thereof, all as set forth in the Intellectual Property Bankruptcy Protection Act, Public Law 100-506, 102 Stat. 2538.\n\n                                       19\n\n     (d) In full and complete payment of the licenses granted in this Agreement, the parties have made the payment described in the Distribution Agreement as set forth in the Distribution Agreement.\n\n     (e) Each party shall notify the other party of any involuntary attachment or other judicial process affecting the Licensed Materials.\n\n                                    ARTICLE V\n\n                                   THE CLOSING\n\n     Section 5.1. Equifax Deliverables.\n\n     On or before the Distribution Date, and effective as of the Closing Date, Equifax will, and/or will cause each member of the Equifax Group to, deliver to Certegy each of the following:\n\n     (a) Duly executed assignment and assumption agreements necessary for the assignment and transfer to, and the assumption by Certegy of, the Transferred Equifax Assets and Transferred Equifax Third Party Agreements;\n\n     (b) Duly executed assignment and assumption agreements necessary for the assignment and transfer to, and the assumption by Equifax of, the Equifax Liabilities; and\n\n     (c)  Such other agreements, leases, documents or instruments as the parties may agree are necessary or desirable in order to achieve the purposes of this Agreement.\n\n     Section 5.2. Certegy Deliverables.\n\n     On the Closing Date, Certegy will, and/or will cause each member of the\n\n\n\n\n\nCertegy Group to, deliver to Equifax each of the following:\n\n     (a) Duly executed assignment and assumption agreements necessary for the assignment and transfer to, and the assumption by Equifax of, the Transferred Certegy Assets and the Transferred Certegy Third Party Agreements;\n\n     (b) Duly executed assignment and assumption agreements necessary for the assignment and transfer to, and the assumption by Certegy of, the Certegy Liabilities; and\n\n     (c) Such other agreements, documents or instruments as the parties may agree are necessary or desirable in order to achieve the purposes of this Agreement.\n\n                                       20\n\n                                   ARTICLE VI\n\n                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES\n\n     Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or any Related Agreement, neither any member of the Equifax Group, nor any member of the Certegy Group, has given or is giving any representation or warranty regarding the assets or Liabilities retained, transferred, assumed or licensed as contemplated hereby or thereby, including without limitation, (i) title to the assets, (ii) validity of the Liabilities, (iii) any lien, claim or other encumbrance affecting the assets or Liabilities, or (iv) the value of the assets and the amount of the Liabilities. Except as may be expressly set forth in this Agreement or any Related Agreement, all assets and Liabilities were, or are being, transferred, assigned, licensed, assumed, or are being retained, on an \"AS IS,\" \"WHERE IS\" basis and the respective transferees, licensees and assignees will bear the economic and legal risks that any such conveyance (x) shall prove to be insufficient to vest in the transferee a title that is free and clear of any lien, claim or other encumbrance, or (y) shall not constitute an infringement of a third party's rights.\n\n                                   ARTICLE VII\n\n                                 INDEMNIFICATION\n\n     Section 7.1. Certegy Indemnification of the Equifax Group.\n\n     If the Distribution occurs, on and after the Distribution Date, Certegy shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each member of the Equifax Group, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively the \"Equifax Indemnitees\") from and against any and all damage, loss, liability and expense, (including without limitation, reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with any and all Actions or threatened Actions (collectively, \"Indemnifiable Losses\") incurred or suffered by any of the Equifax Indemnitees and arising out of, or due to, the failure of Certegy, or any other member of the Certegy Group, to timely pay, perform or otherwise discharge, any of the Certegy Liabilities or its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n                                       21\n\n     Section 7.2. Equifax Indemnification of the Certegy Group.\n\n     If the Distribution occurs, on and after the Distribution Date, Equifax shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each member of the Certegy Group and each of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively the \"Certegy Indemnitees\") from and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses incurred or suffered by any of the Certegy Indemnitees and arising out of, or due to, the failure of Equifax, or any other member of the Equifax Group, to timely pay, perform or otherwise discharge, any of the Equifax Liabilities or its obligations under this Agreement or any Related Agreement.\n\n     Section 7.3. Insurance and Third Party Obligations.\n\n     No insurer or any other third party shall be, by virtue of the foregoing indemnification provisions, (a) entitled to a benefit it would not be entitled to receive in the absence of such provisions, (b) relieved of the responsibility to pay any claims to which it is obligated, or (c) entitled to any subrogation rights with respect to any obligation hereunder.\n\n                                  ARTICLE VIII\n\n                           INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES\n\n     Section 8.1. Notice and Payment of Claims.\n\n     If any Equifax Indemnitee or Certegy Indemnitee (the \"Indemnified Party\") determines that it is or may be entitled to indemnification by a party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") under Article VII (other than in connection with any Action or claim subject to Section 8.2), the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party a written notice specifying, to the extent reasonably practicable, the basis for its claim for indemnification and the amount for which the Indemnified Party reasonably believes it is entitled to be indemnified. After the Indemnifying Party shall have been notified of the amount for which the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification, the Indemnifying Party\n\n\n\n\n\nshall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, pay the Indemnified Party such amount in cash or other immediately available funds (or reach agreement with the Indemnified Party as to a mutually agreeable alternative payment schedule) unless the Indemnifying Party objects to the claim for indemnification or the amount thereof. If the Indemnifying Party does not give the Indemnified Party written notice objecting to such claim and setting forth the grounds therefor within the same thirty (30) day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have acknowledged its liability for such claim and the Indemnified Party may exercise any and all of its rights under applicable law to collect such amount. Any amount owed under this Section 8.1 that is past due shall bear interest at a simple rate of interest per annum equal to the lesser of 1% per month or the maximum amount permitted by law.\n\n     Section 8.2. Notice and Defense of Third Party Claims.\n\n     (a) Promptly following the earlier of (i) receipt of notice of the commencement by a third party of any Action against or otherwise involving any Indemnified Party, or (ii) receipt of information from a third party alleging the existence of a claim against an Indemnified Party,\n\n                                       22\n\nwith respect to which indemnification may be sought pursuant to this Agreement (a \"Third Party Claim\"), the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party written notice thereof. The failure of the Indemnified Party to give notice as provided in this Section 8.2(a) shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure to give notice. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, the Indemnifying Party shall by giving written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, (i) acknowledge, as between the parties hereto, liability for and, at its option, elect to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim at its sole cost and expense, or (ii) object to the claim of indemnification set forth in the notice delivered by the Indemnified Party pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 8.2(a) setting forth the grounds therefor; provided that if the Indemnifying Party does not within the same thirty (30) day period give the Indemnified Party written notice acknowledging liability or objecting to such claim and setting forth the grounds therefor, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have acknowledged, as between the parties hereto, its liability for such Third Party Claim.\n\n     (b) Any contest of a Third Party Claim as to which the Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense shall be conducted by attorneys employed by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided that the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in such proceedings and to be represented by attorneys of its own choosing at the Indemnified Party's sole cost and expense. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle or compromise the claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party; provided that the Indemnifying Party may not agree to any such settlement pursuant to which any such remedy or relief, other than monetary damages for which the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible hereunder, shall be applied to or against the Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.\n\n     (c) If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of a Third Party Claim for which it has acknowledged liability for indemnification under Article VII, the Indemnified Party may require the Indemnifying Party to reimburse it on a current basis for its reasonable expenses of investigation, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in defending against such Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by the result obtained with respect thereto by the Indemnified Party; provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party in cash the amount for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to be indemnified (if any) within fifteen (15) days after the final resolution of such Third Party Claim (whether by settlement, compromise, or by the final nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise), or, in the case of any Third Party Claim as to which the Indemnifying Party has not acknowledged liability, within fifteen (15) days after the Indemnifying Party's objection has been resolved by settlement, compromise, or the final nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n     (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall either Equifax or Certegy, or any Member of their respective Group, have any liability, whether based on contract, tort (including, without limitation, negligence or strict liability), warranty or any other legal or equitable\n\n                                       23\n\ngrounds, for any punitive, consequential, indirect, exemplary, special or incidental loss or damage suffered by the other arising from or related to this Agreement, including without limitation, loss of data, profits, interest or revenue, or interruption of business, even if such party has been informed of or might otherwise anticipated or foreseen the possibility of such losses or damages; provided, however, that such limitations shall not apply to liabilities which may arise as the result of willful misconduct of a party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any damages awarded or obtained (whether by settlement, compromise or judgment) as a result of Third Party Claims shall be considered direct damages for purposes of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                   ARTICLE IX\n\n                                 CONFIDENTIALITY\n\n     Section 9.1. Exclusions.\n\n     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, \"Company Information\" does not include any information that before being divulged by the receiving party (a) has become generally known to the public through no wrongful act of the receiving party; (b) has been rightfully received by the receiving party from a third party without restriction on disclosure and without, to the knowledge of the receiving party, a breach of an obligation of confidentiality running directly or indirectly to the disclosing party; (c) has been approved for release to the general public by a written authorization of the disclosing party; (d) has been independently developed by the receiving party without use, directly or indirectly, of Company Information received from the disclosing party; or (e) has been furnished to a third party by the disclosing party without restrictions on the third party's rights to disclose the information.\n\n     Section 9.2. Confidentiality.\n\n     (a) Each party acknowledges, and shall cause each member of the Group to acknowledge, that it is in possession of significant confidential or proprietary information concerning the business, operations and assets of the members of the other Group.\n\n     (b) Each party shall, and shall ensure that each member of its Group shall, (i) receive and hold the Company Information of the other Group in trust and in strictest confidence; (ii) protect such Company Information from disclosure and in no event take any action causing, or fail to take the action necessary in order to prevent, any such Company Information to lose its character as Company Information; (iii) exercise at a minimum the same care it would exercise to protect its own highly confidential information; and (iv) not use, reproduce, distribute, disclose, or otherwise disseminate the Company Information of the other Group, (A) except as authorized pursuant to this Agreement or any Related Agreement, or (B) except pursuant to a requirement of a governmental agency or of law without similar restrictions or other protections against public disclosure; provided, however, with respect to disclosures pursuant to (B) above, the receiving party must first give written notice of such required disclosure to the disclosing party, take reasonable steps to allow the disclosing party to seek to protect the confidentiality of the Company Information required to be disclosed, make a reasonable effort to obtain a protective order requiring that the Company Information so disclosed be used only for the purposes for which disclosure is required, and shall disclose only that part of the Company Information\n\n                                       24\n\nwhich, in the written opinion of its legal counsel, it is required to disclose. In no event shall the receiving party exercise less than a reasonable standard of care to keep confidential the Company Information. Any and all reproductions of such Company Information must prominently contain a confidential legend.\n\n     (c) The receiving party may make disclosures of the Company Information of the disclosing party only to Representatives of the receiving party's Group (i) who have a specific need to know such information; and (ii) who the receiving party has obligated under a written agreement to hold such Company Information in trust and in strictest confidence and otherwise to comply with the terms and provisions of this Agreement or terms and conditions substantially similar to and implementing the same restrictions and covenants as those set forth in this Agreement. Certegy and Equifax agree, and shall ensure that each member of their respective Group agrees, to diligently monitor each such Representative, diligently enforce such agreements with its Representatives, and, upon request by the other party, promptly to furnish to the other party a certified list of the receiving party's Representatives having had access to such Company Information.\n\n     (d) The covenants of confidentiality set forth in this Agreement (i) will apply after the Closing Date to all Company Information disclosed to the receiving party before, on and after the Closing Date and (ii) will continue and must be maintained from the Closing Date through the termination of the relationship under this Agreement between Equifax and Certegy (A) with respect to Proprietary Information, the period during which the Proprietary Information constituting a part of the Company Information retains its status as a \"trade secret\" under applicable law; and (B) with respect to Confidential Information constituting a part of the Company Information, for the shorter of a period equal to three (3) years after the Closing Date, or until such Confidential Information no longer qualifies as confidential under applicable law.\n\n     Section 9.3. Employee Confidentiality Agreements.\n\n     The members of each Group have entered into confidentiality and non- disclosure agreements with their respective employees. To the extent that any employee during or after employment violates any such agreement and such violation is or may in the future be to the detriment of the other Group, at the written request of the affected party, the other party shall, or shall cause the appropriate members of its Group to, promptly bring and diligently pursue an action against such employee if and to the extent reasonable under the circumstances to preserve the value of the assets and Licensed Materials. The Group member employing the employee violating his/her confidentiality and non- disclosure agreement shall have the unilateral right to determine the forum for, the manner of proceeding in, and legal counsel for such action and shall be\n\n\n\n\n\nentitled to any damages or other relief against such employee awarded in such action to the extent related to such Group's assets or business or to the Licensed Materials. Such enforcement against and recovery by a Group member from its breaching employee shall not constitute a release or sole remedy for the members of the other Group injured by such breaching employee's actions, and such members of the other Group may bring a claim against the Group members employing the breaching employee for a breach of this Agreement. Each party shall bear all out-of-pocket costs of pursuing such action and the other party shall cooperate in connection therewith.\n\n                                       25\n\n     Section 9.4. Rights and Remedies.\n\n     (a) If either party, or any member of the Group, should breach or threaten to breach any of the provisions of this Agreement, the non-breaching party, in addition to any other remedies it may have at law or in equity, will be entitled to a restraining order, injunction, or other similar remedy in order to specifically enforce the provisions of this Agreement. Each party specifically acknowledges, and shall cause each member of its respective Group to acknowledge, that money damages alone would be an inadequate remedy for the injuries and damage that would be suffered and incurred by the non-breaching party as a result of a breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement. In the event that either party, or a member of such party's Group, should seek an injunction hereunder, the other party hereby waives, and shall cause each member of its Group to waive, any requirement for the submission of proof of the economic value of any Company Information or the posting of a bond or any other security. In the event of a dispute between the parties, the non-prevailing party shall pay all costs and expenses associated with resolving the dispute, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees.\n\n     (b) The receiving party shall notify the disclosing party immediately upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Company Information, or any other breach of this Agreement by the receiving party or any Representative of the receiving party's Group, and will cooperate with the disclosing party in every reasonable way to help the disclosing party regain possession of its Company Information and prevent its further unauthorized use or disclosure. The receiving party shall be responsible for the acts of any Representative of its Group that are in violation of this Agreement.\n\n     Section 9.5. Competitive Activities.\n\n     (a) Subject to the rights and obligations set forth in this Article IX, each party understands and acknowledges that the other party's Group may now market or have under development products that are competitive with products or services now offered or that may be offered by it and/or members of its Group, and the parties' communications hereunder will not serve to impair the right of either party, or any member of its respective Group, to independently develop, make, use, procure, or market products or services now or in the future that may be competitive with those offered by the other party's Group, nor require either party, and/or the members of its Group, to disclose any planning or other information to the other party.\n\n     (b) Neither party will be restricted in using, in the development, manufacturing and marketing of its products and services and its operations, any data processing or network management or operation ideas, concepts, know-how and techniques which are retained in the minds of employees who have had access to the other party's Company Information subject to the restrictions set forth in this Agreement.\n\n     Section 9.6. No Implied Rights.\n\n     Except as provided herein or in any Related Agreement, all Company Information is and shall remain the property of the disclosing party and/or the respective member of its Group. By disclosing Company Information to the receiving\n\n                                       26\n\nparty's Group, the disclosing party and/or the members of its Group do(es) not grant any express or implied rights or license to the receiving party's Group to or under any patents, patent applications, inventions, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret information, or other intellectual property rights heretofore or hereafter possessed by the disclosing party and/or the members of its Group.\n\n                                    ARTICLE X\n\n                              CONTINUED ASSISTANCE\n\n     Section 10.1. Continued Assistance and Transition.\n\n     (a) Following the Closing Date, Equifax shall, and shall cause each member of the Equifax Group to, cooperate in an orderly transfer of the Transferred Equifax Assets and the Transferred Equifax Third Party Agreements to Certegy or the respective Designated Certegy Member. From time to time, at Certegy's request and without further consideration, Equifax shall, and shall cause each member of the Equifax Group, as applicable, to execute, acknowledge and deliver such documents, instruments or assurances and take such other action as Certegy may reasonably request to more effectively assign, convey and transfer any of the Transferred Equifax Assets and the Transferred Equifax Third Party\n\n\n\n\n\nAgreements. Equifax will assist Certegy in the vesting, collection or reduction to possession of such Transferred Equifax Assets and Transferred Equifax Third Party Agreements.\n\n     (b) Following the Closing Date, Certegy shall, and shall cause each member of the Certegy Group to, cooperate in an orderly transfer of the Transferred Certegy Assets and Transferred Certegy Third Party Agreements to Equifax or the respective Designated Equifax Member. From time to time, at Equifax's request and without further consideration, Certegy shall, and shall cause each member of the Certegy Group, as applicable, to execute, acknowledge and deliver such documents, instruments or assurances and take such other action as Equifax may reasonably request to more effectively assign, convey and transfer any of the Transferred Certegy Assets and Transferred Certegy Third Party Agreements. Certegy will assist Equifax in the vesting, collection or reduction to possession of such Transferred Certegy Assets and Transferred Certegy Third Party Agreements.\n\n     Section 10.2. Records and Documents.\n\n     (a) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Equifax and Certegy shall each arrange for the delivery to the other of existing corporate and other documents (e.g. documents of title, source code, contracts, etc.) in its possession relating to the Transferred Assets, Transferred Third Party Agreements and assumed Liabilities.\n\n     (b) From and after the Closing Date, Equifax and Certegy shall each, and shall cause each member of its Group to, afford the other and its accountants, counsel and other designated Representatives reasonable access (including using reasonable efforts to give access to person or firms possessing such information) and duplicating rights during normal business hours to all records, books, contracts, instruments, computer data and other data and information in its possession relating to the assets, Liabilities, Licensed Materials, business and affairs of the other (other than data and information subject to any attorney/client or other privilege), insofar as such\n\n                                       27\n\naccess is reasonably required by the other, including without limitation, for audit, accounting and litigation purposes.\n\n     (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may destroy or otherwise dispose of any information at any time in accordance with the corporate record retention policy maintained by such party with respect to its own records.\n\n     Section 10.3. Litigation Cooperation.\n\n     Upon written request, Equifax and Certegy shall, and shall cause each member of its Group to, use reasonable efforts to cooperate in the evaluation and defense of third party Actions arising out of the business of the other party or of any member of the other party's Group prior to the Distribution Date in which the requesting party or any member of its Group may from time to time be involved, at the cost and expense of the requesting party. Such cooperation shall include, without limitation, making its Representatives available as witnesses or consultants to the extent that such persons may reasonably be required in connection with such third party Actions.\n\n                                   ARTICLE XI\n\n                                  MISCELLANEOUS\n\n     Section 11.1.

ARTICLE II DRILLING AND COMPLETING THE INITIAL WELL\n\n2.1   BP has commenced drilling operations for the Initial Well, and, except as provided elsewhere in this Agreement, BP shall continue drilling the Initial Well with due diligence to the Objective Zone and perform all logging and testing operations to which the Parties agree. Company shall pay 11.67% of the Drilling Costs of the Initial Well, regardless of whether the Initial Well is successfully drilled to the Objective Zone. BP has estimated that Drilling Costs will be approximately FOURTEEN MILLION, EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS ($14,862,000) (the \"Estimated Drilling Costs\") for the Initial Well. Company shall pay its share of Estimated Drilling Costs, being ONE MILLION, SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND, THREE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE DOLLARS ($1,734,395), at execution of this Agreement via wire transfer according to the wiring instructions set forth in Exhibit \"I\", but Company will pay its share of actual Drilling Costs in accordance with this Article II and Section 5.4.\n\n2.2  When and if Casing Point is reached in the Initial Well, BP shall give written notice to Company of such occurrence, and such notice shall state whether BP proposes to attempt to Complete the Initial Well as a producer, whether in the Objective Zone or in a shallower Zone, or to abandon the Initial Well as a dry hole. The notice shall be accompanied by all well information and data set forth in Exhibit \"D\" (the \"Well Information\"), unless such information has been previously furnished to Company.\n\n  (A) If BP reaches Casing Point and proposes to Complete the Initial Well as a producer, whether in the Objective Zone or in a shallower Zone, such notice shall also include a completion AFE. The completion AFE shall include, at a minimum, an estimate of Completion Costs for the Initial Well. Company shall have forty-eight (48) hours (exclusive of Saturday, Sunday and holidays) from receipt of the notice to elect, by written notice, whether it will participate in accordance with Section 2.3. BP shall not Complete the Initial Well until Company has notified BP in writing whether or not it will participate or until forty-eight (48) hours (exclusive of Saturday, Sunday and holidays) have elapsed since Company's receipt of BP's notice. Failure to respond within the time period allowed shall be deemed to be an election not to participate in the Completion of the Initial Well.\n\n  (B) If BP reaches Casing Point and proposes to abandon the Initial Well as a dry hole, (i) BP shall plug and abandon the Initial Well in accordance with Section 2.6, and (ii) Company shall have no right or option to takeover the Initial Well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3  If BP proposes to Complete the Initial Well and Company timely elects to participate in such Completion attempt in accordance with Section 2.2(A), Company shall pay 8.75% of the Completion Costs associated with the Initial Well and 8.75% of the cost of any newly acquired surface equipment associated with the Initial Well beyond the wellhead connections (including but not limited to stock tanks, separators, treaters, pumping equipment, piping, and metering devices).   2.4  If BP proposes to Complete the Initial Well and Company elects not to participate in such Completion attempt, or is deemed not to participate, BP may nonetheless continue with such operation and carry Company's proportionate part of Completion Costs. If the Completion attempt is ultimately not successful, BP shall abandon the Initial Well in accordance with Section 2.6 or propose to Complete the Initial Well in another Zone under the provisions of Section 2.2 (and Company shall be given another election to participate in such newly proposed Completion). If the Completion attempt results in the production of oil and/or gas in paying quantities, the Initial Well shall be operated by BP at the expense and for the account of BP and other parties who agreed to participate in the Completion attempt. By electing not to participate in any Completion attempt, or being deemed not to participate in any Completion attempt, Company shall be deemed to have relinquished to BP, and BP shall own and be entitled to receive, all of Company's interest in the Initial Well and share of production therefrom until the proceeds of the sale of such share, calculated at the well, or market value thereof if such share is not sold (after deducting applicable ad valorem, production, severance, windfall profits, and excise taxes, royalty, overriding royalty and other interests payable out of or measured by the production from the Initial Well accruing with respect to such interest until it reverts), shall equal the total of the following:\n\n  (A) twenty six and one-quarter percent (26.25%) of the Completion Costs associated with the Initial Well and twenty six and one-quarter percent (26.25%) of the cost of any newly acquired surface equipment beyond the wellhead connections (including but not limited to stock tanks, separators, treaters, pumping equipment, piping and metering devices) (i.e., 300% non-consent penalty on a non-promoted basis); and\n\n  (B) eight and three quarters percent (8.75%) of the cost of operation of the Initial Well commencing with first production and continuing until Company's interest shall revert to it in accordance with this Section 2.4 (i.e., 100% non-consent penalty on a non-promoted basis).\n\n2.5  Company shall bear its proportionate part, being eight and three quarters percent (8.75%), of any severance, production and gathering taxes and any other taxes imposed or measured by the volume or value of production from the Initial Well, including, but only by way of illustration, excise taxes and windfall profit taxes, whether enacted by federal, state or local authority.\n\n2.6  The Initial Well shall be plugged and abandoned in accordance with applicable regulations and at the cost, risk and expense of the parties who participated in the cost of drilling the Initial Well. Company's proportionate share of the cost, risk and expense to plug and abandon the Initial Well shall be eight and three quarters percent (8.75%).   ARTICLE III SUBSTITUTE WELLS\n\n3.1   If, prior to reaching Casing Point in the Initial Well, BP should encounter geological or mechanical conditions which render further operations impracticable or economically infeasible, in the sole reasonable opinion of BP, BP shall (i) give written notice of such occurrence to Company, and (ii) such notice shall state whether BP proposes to attempt to Complete the Initial Well in a shallower Zone or to abandon the Initial Well as a dry hole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (A) If BP proposes to Complete the Initial Well without reaching the Objective Zone, such notice shall also include a completion AFE. The completion AFE shall include, at a minimum, an estimate of Completion Costs for the Initial Well. Company shall have forty-eight (48) hours (exclusive of Saturday, Sunday and holidays) from receipt of the notice to elect, by written notice, whether it will participate in accordance with Section 2.3. BP shall not Complete the Initial Well until Company has notified BP in writing whether or not it will participate or until forty-eight (48) hours (exclusive of Saturday, Sunday and holidays) have elapsed since Company's receipt of BP's notice. Failure to respond within the time period allowed shall be deemed to be an election not to participate in the Completion of the Initial Well. If BP proposes to Complete the Initial Well and Company elects not to participate in such Completion attempt, or is deemed not to participate, BP may nonetheless continue with such operation and carry Company's proportionate part of Completion Costs in accordance with Section 2.4.\n\n  (B) If BP proposes to abandon the Initial Well as a dry hole, (i) BP shall plug and abandon the Initial Well in accordance with Section 2.6, and (ii) Company shall have no right or option to takeover the Initial Well.\n\n3.2  If BP does not drill the Initial Well to the Objective Zone, Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, for a period of one (1) year from the date the drilling rig used to drill the Initial Well is removed from the well site location for the Initial Well (the \"Rig Release Date\"), to participate in the drilling of a Substitute Well. BP shall have no obligation to drill a Substitute Well, and Company shall have no right to propose a Substitute Well. If and when BP elects to drill a Substitute Well, BP shall provide Company with an AFE for the Substitute Well. The AFE for the Substitute Well shall include, at a minimum, the surface and bottomhole location of the Substitute Well, the Objective Zone, and the estimated costs for the Substitute Well as a dry hole and as a producer. Company shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of such written notice to elect whether it shall participate in such Substitute Well. Failure to respond within the time period allowed shall be deemed to be an election not to participate in the Substitute Well.\n\n3.3  If BP proposes to drill a Substitute Well and Company timely elects to participate in such Substitute Well in accordance with Section 3.2, such Substitute Well shall be treated for all purposes herein as the Initial Well (including, but not limited to, Company's obligation to pay 11.67% of the Drilling Costs for such Substitute Well), except that the Objective Zone for such Substitute Well shall be governed by the AFE for such Substitute Well.\n\n3.4  If Company elects not to participate in a Substitute Well, or is deemed not to participate in a Substitute Well, this Agreement shall terminate except as provided in Sections 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, and 6.5.\n\nARTICLE IV EARNING RIGHTS\n\n4.1  When and if the Initial Well is drilled to the Objective Zone and successfully Completed as a well capable of producing oil and/or gas in paying quantities, BP shall assign to Company, by partial assignment in the form attached hereto as Exhibit \"E\"(the \"Partial Assignment\"), an eight and three quarters percent (8.75%) working interest in the Initial Well and an eight and three quarters percent (8.75%) interest in the BP Interests.   4.2  If the Initial Well is not drilled to the Objective Zone, for any reason, but the Initial Well is successfully Completed as a well capable of producing oil and/or gas in paying quantities, BP shall assign to Company, by partial assignment in the form of the Partial Assignment, an eight and three quarters percent (8.75%) working interest in the Initial Well and an undivided eight and three quarters percent (8.75%) interest in the BP Interests, but limited as to the geographic boundaries of the Unit in which the Initial Well is located and further limited as to those depths between the surface and the stratigraphic equivalent of the deepest Zone penetrated in the Initial Well (the \"Partial Interest\"). BP and Company shall conduct operations with respect to such Initial Well as if they have entered into the Operating Agreement until such well or a Substitute Well is drilled to and successfully Completed in the Objective Zone or until this Agreement is terminated; provided, however, if this Agreement is to be terminated without Company earning its proportionate share of the BP Interests in accordance with Section 4.1, then the Parties shall enter into an operating agreement in the form of the Operating Agreement except that the contract area of such operating agreement shall be limited to the Partial Interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE V JOINT OPERATIONS\n\n5.1   BP does not own but has a limited non-exclusive right to use the Data in accordance with the Seismic Use Agreements. Under the Seismic Use Agreements, BP may not sell, assign, copy, transfer, display, exhibit or in any way reveal the Data, except as authorized by and in compliance with the provisions of the Seismic Use Agreements. Therefore, Company's access to the Data shall be limited, and may be prohibited all together upon execution of this Agreement, unless Company obtains the consent or otherwise enters into a seismic license or seismic use agreement with the Data Owner. BP does not represent or warrant in any way, and expressly disclaims any representations or warranties, of any kind, express, implied or otherwise, that it owns the Data or otherwise has the right to provide all or any portion of the Data to Company.\n\n5.2  BP shall deliver to Company the Well Information derived from or attributable to the Initial Well and any Substitute Well and Additional Well, if such Well Information is acquired, obtained, or performed by BP.\n\n5.3   The Initial Well and each Substitute Well and Additional Well shall be under the exclusive control of BP and the operation thereof shall be conducted in a prudent and workmanlike manner. BP shall conduct all its activities under this Agreement as a reasonable prudent operator, in a good and workmanlike manner, with due diligence and dispatch, in accordance with good oilfield practice, and in compliance with applicable law and regulation, but in no event shall BP have any liability to Company for losses sustained or liabilities or obligations incurred except such as may result from BP's gross negligence or willful misconduct.\n\n5.4  Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, BP shall promptly pay and discharge expenses incurred in drilling the Initial Well and each Substitute Well and Additional Well pursuant to this Agreement and shall charge Company with its proportionate shares upon the expense basis provided in Exhibit \"C\" to the Operating Agreement, whether or not such Operating Agreement has been executed by the Parties. BP shall keep an accurate record, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, showing expenses incurred and charges and credits made and received.\n\n5.5  When and if the Initial Well is drilled to the Objective Zone and successfully Completed as a well capable of producing oil and/or gas in paying quantities, BP and Company shall enter into an operating agreement attached hereto as Exhibit \"F\" (the \"Operating Agreement\") covering the Contract Area. The Operating Agreement shall be executed contemporaneously with the Partial Assignment but shall be effective on October 1, 2006. The Operating Agreement shall apply to all Additional Wells. In the event of any conflict between the Operating Agreement and this Agreement, this Agreement shall govern.\n\n5.6  Unless Company elects by thirty (30) days' prior written notice to BP either to take in kind or to separately dispose of its share of oil, gas and other hydrocarbons, BP shall in good faith, to the extent it can do so, cause Company's share of production from the Initial Well and each Substitute Well and Additional Wells to be marketed and sold to either a Third Party or to an Affiliate of BP in a commercially reasonable manner, which terms shall not be less than on the same terms and conditions as BP's share of production from such wells are sold. It is recognized by the Parties that BP, or its predecessor, has provided at its cost or made arrangements with Third Parties to provide certain facilities beyond the wellhead (the \"Plants\") needed for producing, storing, separating, gathering, treating, processing and delivering production from the Initial Well and each Substitute Well and Additional Well. It is agreed that BP will continue to make the Plants (as they or any contractual arrangements related thereto may be modified, changed or upgraded) proportionately available to handle BP, Company and Third Party production from the Contract Area. It is understood that a proportionate share of the cost of maintaining and operating the Plants, including depreciation or rental in lieu of depreciation and actual Third Party costs, whether on a cash fee basis or on a retained volume basis, will be allocated to the Parties on a \"throughput\" basis (being that portion of such costs relating to the production volumes from the Initial Well or, if drilled, any Substitute Well or Additional Well, as each may bear to the total production volumes handled by the Plants, including any Third Party or BP volumes not produced from the Initial Well or, if drilled, any Substitute Well or Additional Well). Nothing herein shall be construed to impart, transfer or convey any ownership interest in the Plants to Company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.7  If any lands within the Contract Area (other than those lands covered by the Leases) contain an interest which is unleased or leased to a Third Party and such interest must be carried in order to conduct operations consistent with this Agreement (such Third Party interest being a \"Carried Interest\"), Company shall bear eight and three quarters percent (8.75%) of the Carried Interests in order to conduct such operations.\n\n5.8  At all times while this Agreement is in effect, Company shall carry insurance of the types and in the minimum amounts set forth in Exhibit \"G\". All such insurance set forth in Exhibit \"G\" shall specifically name BP as an additional insured or provide that the insurer shall waive all rights of subrogation against BP.\n\nARTICLE VI TERM AND TERMINATION\n\n6.1  Except as provided in Sections 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, and 6.5, this Agreement shall terminate one (1) year from the Rig Release Date, if such has not been terminated sooner pursuant to the provisions hereof.\n\n6.2  Notwithstanding Section 6.1, if the Initial Well is drilled to the Objective Zone and successfully Completed as a well capable of producing oil and/or gas in paying quantities, this Agreement shall continue for so long as the Operating Agreement remains in full force and effect.\n\n6.3   Notwithstanding Section 6.1, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect for so long as Company participates in the drilling of a Substitute Well in accordance with Section 3.2.\n\n6.4  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Company earns a Partial Interest in the Initial Well and the BP Interests pursuant to Section 4.2, the Parties shall first enter into an operating agreement in the form of the Operating Agreement, except that the contract area of such operating agreement shall be limited to the Partial Interest, prior to termination of this Agreement.\n\n6.5  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the expiration or termination of this Agreement shall not release any of the Parties from any obligation or liability which accrued prior to such expiration or termination (including the costs to plug and abandon the Initial Well and any Substitute Wells and Additional Wells) or which, by the terms hereof, is intended to survive such expiration or termination, including but not limited to Articles I, X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, and XVI and Sections 5.1 and 5.6, which terms shall survive indefinitely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE VII ASSIGNMENT; PREFERENTIAL RIGHTS\n\n7.1   The rights and obligations created by this Agreement may not be assigned by Company, in whole or in part, without first obtaining BP's written consent under this Agreement, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. If BP consents to an assignment by Company of all or part of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, it is nevertheless understood and agreed that any such consent shall not relieve Company of its primary liability for the performance of and compliance with the terms and provisions hereof, and shall not have the effect nor be construed to have the effect of waiving this limitation as to future, further, or additional assignments. Any assignment of the rights and obligations under this Agreement by Company without the consent of BP shall be voidable by BP.\n\n7.2  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other agreement, including the Operating Agreement, should Company desire to sell all or any part of its interest in the Initial Well, the BP Interests, or any Substitute Well or Additional Well, Company shall promptly give written notice to BP, with full information concerning its proposed disposition, which shall include the name and address of the prospective transferee (who must be ready, willing and able to purchase), the purchase price, a legal description sufficient to identify the property, and all other terms of the offer. BP shall then have an optional prior right, for a period of fifteen (15) days after receipt of such written notice, to purchase for the stated consideration on the same terms and conditions the interest which Company proposes to sell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE VIII NOTICE\n\n8.1  All notices and other communications required or desired to be given hereunder must be in writing and sent (properly addressed as set forth below) by (a) certified or registered U.S. mail, return receipt requested, with all postage and other charges fully prepaid, (b) hand or courier delivery, or (c) facsimile transmission.

ADMA agrees to assume the risks of loss to the Sanofi Pasteur Property and shall reimburse Sanofi Pasteur, at the dollar value, the Source Plasma in case of damage or loss.

If Metavante terminates any Service pursuant to this paragraph, Metavante agrees to assist Customer, without additional charge, in identifying an alternate provider of such terminated Service, and the Customer shall not be assessed a Termination Fee for such terminated service.\n\n7.3. Partial Termination by Customer. Except as may be provided in any Schedule, Customer agrees that, during the Term, Metavante shall be Customer's sole and exclusive provider of all Services included in Metavante's Integrated Banking Solution (deposit and loan processing services provided by Metavante as of the Commencement Date). If Customer breaches the foregoing covenant, the same shall constitute a partial termination of this Agreement, and Customer shall pay Metavante the Termination Fee for the affected Service, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty.\n\n8. TERMINATION/DEFAULT\n\n8.1. Early Termination. The terms and conditions set forth in this Section 8 shall govern the early termination of this Agreement (or any Service).\n\n8.2. For Cause. If either party fails to perform any of its material obligations (including Section 7.1 hereof) under this Agreement (a \"Default\") and does not cure such Default in accordance with this Section, then the non-defaulting party may, by giving notice to the other party, terminate this Agreement as of the date specified in such notice of termination, or such later date agreed to by the parties, and/or recover Damages. Except as provided in Section 4.1 C, a party may terminate the Agreement in accordance with the foregoing if such party provides written notice to the defaulting party and either (a) the defaulting party does not cure the Default within sixty (60) days of the defaulting party's receipt of notice of the Default, if the Default is capable of cure within sixty (60) days, or (b) if the Default is not capable of cure within sixty (60) days, the defaulting party does not both (i) implement a plan to cure the Default within sixty (60) days of receipt of notice of the Default, and (ii) diligently carry-out the plan in accordance with its terms. The parties acknowledge and agree that a failure to pay any amount when due hereunder shall be a Default that is capable of being cured within thirty (30) days. Except as provided in the Service Level Schedule, the parties acknowledge and agree that any error in processing data, preparation or filing of a report, form, or file, or the failure to perform Services as required hereunder shall be satisfactorily cured upon the completion of accurate re-processing, the preparation or filing of the accurate report, form, or file, or the re-performance of the Services in accordance with applicable requirements, respectively.\n\n8.3.

Termination for Convenience. Customer may elect to terminate this Agreement for any reason upon six months written notice to Metavante, provided Customer shall pay Metavante the \"Termination Fee\" defined and computed in accordance with the table below. The \"Termination Fee\" shall be paid prior to the Effective Date of Termination of the Agreement, as applicable. In addition to the foregoing, Customer shall pay to Metavante any amortized but unpaid one-time set-up fees, enhancement fees or implementation fees and all reasonable costs in connection with the disposition of equipment, facilities and contracts exclusively related to Metavante's performance of the Services under this Agreement.\n\nThe Termination Fee shall be an amount equal to a percentage of the Estimated Remaining Value as set forth below. The \"Estimated Remaining Value\" means the mathematical product of (a) the average monthly fee paid by Customer with respect to the Initial Services during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the Effective Date of Termination, multiplied by (b) the number of unexpired whole months remaining between the Effective Date of Termination and the expiration of the Initial Term. The Termination Fee shall be equal to the Estimated Remaining Value\n\n\u00a9 2006, Metavante Corporation\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if the Customer chose to terminate for convenience on an agreement with a Commencement Date of January 01, 2007 and provided written notice on July 15, 2009 for a termination date of January 15, 2010, the Estimated Remaining Value would be the average monthly fee during 2009 multiplied by 47 and the Termination Fee would be the Estimated Remaining Value.\n\n8.5. *The information in this paragraph is intentionally omitted because confidential treatment has been requested pursuant to Rule 24b- 2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The omitted information has been filed separately with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n8.6. Cease and Desist Order.

The omitted information has been filed separately with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n9.4. Statute of Limitations. No lawsuit or other action may be brought by either party hereto, or on any claim or controversy based upon or arising in any way out of this Agreement, after two(2) years from the date on which the party knew or reasonably should have known of an event for which a cause of action arose regardless of the nature of the claim or form of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise; provided, however, the foregoing limitation shall not apply to the collection of any amounts due Metavante under this Agreement.\n\n9.5. Tort Claim Waiver. In addition to and not in limitation of any other provision of this Article 9, each party hereby knowingly, voluntarily, and intentionally waives any right to recover from the other party, and Customer waives any right to recover from any Eligible Provider, any economic losses or damages in any action brought under tort theories, including, misrepresentation, negligence and/or strict liability, and/or relating to the quality or performance of any products or services provided by Metavante. For purposes of this waiver, economic losses and damages include monetary losses or damages caused by a defective product or service except personal injury or damage to other tangible property. Even if remedies provided under this Agreement shall be deemed to have failed of their essential purpose, neither party shall have any liability to the other party under tort theories for economic losses or damages.\n\n9.6. Liquidated Damages. Customer acknowledges that Metavante shall suffer a material adverse impact on its business if this Agreement is terminated prior to expiration of the Term, and that the resulting damages may not be susceptible of precise determination. Customer acknowledges that the Termination Fee is a reasonable approximation of such damages and shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and not a penalty.\n\n\u00a9 2006, Metavante Corporation\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.7. Essential Elements. Customer and Metavante acknowledge and agree that the limitations contained in this Article 9 are essential to this Agreement, and that Metavante has expressly relied upon the inclusion of each and every provision of this Article 9 as a condition to executing this Agreement.\n\n10.

Customer agrees to look solely to Metavante, and not to any Eligible Provider, for satisfaction of any claims Customer may have arising out of this Agreement or the performance or nonperformance of Services.

Under the plan, resellers market and promote MediaNet Group Technologies's software product range to their existing customer base and the general Internet community. By referring a customer to the MediaNet Group Technologies web site, the reseller receives a commission for customer's purchase of the MediaNet Group Technologies Brand-A-Port software.\n\nMARKETING AND PROMOTION\n\nResellers are expected to actively market and promote MediaNet Group Technologies Software to their existing customer base and visitors to their web site. Promotion by newsletters and e-mail to customers is encouraged, but we do not encourage spam e-mail and hence specifically ask resellers not to promote MediaNet Group Technologies Software or Applications via unsolicited e-mail.\n\nRESELLER LINK\n\nCustomers are identified as coming from a particular reseller by placing a link(s) on their web site, which contains a cookie (i.e.. small packet of code) which identifies the reseller. On acceptance into the program, MediaNet Group Technologies issues the reseller with the cookie and instructions on how to insert the cookie into their web site.\n\nWHAT PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR RESALE?\n\nProducts which can be resold, include: Brand-A-Port Gold (Generic Portal), Brand-A-Port Platinum Portal and Branded PictureJudge applications. MediaNet Group Technologies may offer additional products from time to time.\n\nCOMMISSION\n\nMediaNet Group Technologies tracks the customer sales coming from the reseller and at the end of every calendar month issues a check for 20% commission to the reseller on product sales and 10% the total amount of hosting/maintenance sales made. Commissions are only paid each month if the amount owing exceeds $100 US. MediaNet Group Technologies reserves the right to change the level of commission\n\n\n\n\n\nwith out notice. Commission is not paid on MediaNet Group Technologies's free-ware programs. (pricing and products subject to change without notice).\n\nCUSTOMER CONTACT\n\nOnce a customer has come from the reseller to the MediaNet Group Technologies web site, MediaNet Group Technologies deals with the customer directly, issuing the software from the MediaNet Group Technologies server and billing the customer. MediaNet Group Technologies handles all technical support and refund issues.\n\nREFUNDS\n\nIf a refund is issued to a customer who came from a reseller, the reseller's account is adjusted accordingly.\n\nTERMINATION\n\nThe Reseller Agreement can be terminated at any time at the discretion of either party.\n\nReseller Agreement                                     Initials ______   _______                                        6\n\nCOMPENSATION SCHEDULE\n\nThis Compensation Schedule is attached hereto and made a part thereof that certain Reseller Agreement of even date:\n\nReseller shall be entitled to receive compensation in the following manner:\n\nCOMPENSATION:\n\nBSP REWARDS PROGRAM: MediaNet shall, upon collection, remit to Member Provider _1_% of the net Rewards earned by Members through and provided directly by it, and _1_% of the net Member Rewards received and collected that is earned through Merchants, Companies, Organizations, Groups and individuals that have been contracted through Member Provider.\n\nBRAND-A-PORT OR BSP PORTAL SALES: MediaNet shall remit to Member Provider 20% of the price of each Portal sold directly by it.\n\nBSP MONTHLY HOSTING FEES: In addition, MediaNet shall remit to Member Provider an amount equal to 10% of the hosting fees paid by Buyers who purchase portals or host websites with MediaNet as a direct result of the activities of Member Provider, whether those activities are sold through the portal or independent of it.\n\nPAYMENT OF COMPENSATION (SUBJECT TO RECEIPT OF GOOD, VALID FUNDS)\n\nPORTAL SALES: MediaNet shall remit all sums due to Member Provider within 30 days of receipt of cleared funds.\n\nMONTHLY HOSTING FEES: In addition, MediaNet shall remit hosting fees to Member Provider in monthly installments on or before the 15th business day of each month.

Resellers must send us an E-mail with the company name, contact and title that you wish to register with the Company. Said contact must have the authority to make the decision relative to the Brand-A-Port and/or BSP programs.\n\n2. MNG will send an e-mail to the Reseller approving or disapproving the registration of the prospective client dependent upon whether or not there has been prior contact by the company, registration of the prospect by another Reseller or other factors as determined by the MNG.\n\n3. Upon approval by MNG, the Reseller will have 30 days to initiate and complete a proposal to said prospect. The proposal must be approved by MNG and receipt confirmed by the prospect.\n\n4. The Reseller will then have 5 months to bring the registered prospect to contract. If a contract is not consummated in the allotted time-frame, the prospect shall then revert back to MNG. Reseller may then re-register the prospect subject to the above criteria and/or other criteria in effect at the time.\n\nThe above criteria points are firm unless a special situation is approved by MNG in writing.\n\nWE BELIEVE THAT EACH REPRESENTATIVE AND RESELLER WILL SEE THE BENEFITS OF THIS PROGRAM AND THE PROTECTION IT AFFORDS THEM.\n\nAPPROVED AND ACCEPTED BY THE SIGNATORY PARTIES BELOW THIS __ OF ________, 200__.\n\nMediaNet Group Technologies, Inc.             ________________________\n\nAccepted by: __________________________    Accepted by:__________________                Chief Executive Officer               Title:\n\nReseller Agreement                                     Initials ______   _______                                        9"}]}, {"title": "DUOSTECHNOLOGIESGROUP,INC_04_21_2009-EX-10.1-STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Strategic Alliance Agreement", "answer_start": 53}], "id": "DUOSTECHNOLOGIESGROUP,INC_04_21_2009-EX-10.1-STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT__Document Name", "question": "The name of the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "System Associates, Inc.", "answer_start": 188}, {"text": "Rubicon", "answer_start": 332}, {"text": "Rubicon Software Group plc", "answer_start": 332}, {"text": "ISA", "answer_start": 321}], "id": "DUOSTECHNOLOGIESGROUP,INC_04_21_2009-EX-10.1-STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT__Parties", "question": "The two or more parties who signed the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "15 April, 2009", "answer_start": 118}], "id": "DUOSTECHNOLOGIESGROUP,INC_04_21_2009-EX-10.1-STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT__Agreement Date", "question": "The date of the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "15 April, 2009", "answer_start": 118}], "id": "DUOSTECHNOLOGIESGROUP,INC_04_21_2009-EX-10.1-STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT__Effective Date", "question": "The date when the contract is effective\u00a0", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "Unless terminated sooner, the term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and continue for three (3) years  thereafter (the \"Initial Term\") and shall automatically renew for additional one (1) year terms on the terms and conditions set forth herein (each a  \"Renewal Term\" and collectively, the \"Term\") unless either party gives the other Party Notice of its intention to terminate this Agreement ninety  (90) days before the end of the Initial Term or Renewal Term, if any.", "answer_start": 18727}], "id": "DUOSTECHNOLOGIESGROUP,INC_04_21_2009-EX-10.1-STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT__Expiration Date", "question": "On what date will the contract's initial term expire?", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "Unless terminated sooner, the term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and continue for three (3) years  thereafter (the \"Initial Term\") and shall automatically renew for additional one (1) year terms on the terms and conditions set forth herein (each a  \"Renewal Term\" and collectively, the \"Term\") unless either party gives the other Party Notice of its intention to terminate this Agreement ninety  (90) days before the end of the Initial Term or Renewal Term, if any.", "answer_start": 18727}], "id": "DUOSTECHNOLOGIESGROUP,INC_04_21_2009-EX-10.1-STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT__Renewal Term", "question": "What is the renewal term after the initial term expires?

The Contract Services shall be performed at the facilities and location reasonably  designated by ISA (with appropriate agreements in place to ensure reasonable reimbursement to Rubicon of out-of-pocket expenses). Upon  written request of ISA, Rubicon shall provide biweekly written reports describing the progress made in performing the Contract Services since the  preceding report, and the progress expected to be made in the next succeeding period.     3.2 ISA may, at any time, request reasonable additions, deletions, or revisions in the Contract Services by delivering a change order to  Rubicon.

All such Contract Services shall be executed  under the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable SOW (as revised by the change order). If any change order causes an  increase or decrease in the cost of the Services to be performed or scheduled completion date or expenses incurred or to be incurred by Rubicon,  an equitable adjustment will be made by mutual agreement.     3.3 From time to time and as agreed between ISA and Rubicon, Rubicon shall provide due diligence services regarding the software and  other technology issues of potential merger and acquisition, joint venture or other strategic partner companies (a \"Target Company\") that may be  identified by ISA (the \"Due Diligence Services\").

Rubicon's fees for such due diligence services (the \"Due Diligence Fees\") shall be at agreed upon rates which shall not  exceed the Day Rate. ISA agrees to reimburse Rubicon upon provision of valid receipts for Rubicon's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred  in the provision of the Due Diligence Services.     4. COMMERCIAL TERMS.     4.1 ISA Fees.

ISA confirms that its current intention is to try and procure that Rubicon's total gross revenues less VAT if  applicable relating to the provision of services to ISA Clients or to clients referred to Rubicon by ISA will exceed \u00a31million per annum. The Parties  acknowledge that any failure by ISA to procure such revenues for Rubicon will not constitute a breach of this Agreement and ISA will have no  liability for any such failure or otherwise in connection with this clause 4.3.     4.4 Payment terms. Each party shall account to the other on a monthly basis in respect of all sales and revenue received, and payments  shall be made within 30 days of receipt of a properly valid invoice.     4.5 Audits.

Rubicon acknowledges that neither it nor any other persons or entities will by virtue of  this Agreement acquire any ownership interest in the Intellectual Property of ISA, or the Intellectual Property rights inherent in or appurtenant to  any of the foregoing, or any associated goodwill and that its rights thereunder are strictly limited to those specifically granted in this Agreement.

It is agreed that the terms under which Rubicon agrees to work with ISA,  including the Day Rate, reflect and will reflect any value or potential value of Intellectual Property created by Rubicon on behalf of ISA.     5.2.2 Rubicon shall make full and prompt disclosure to ISA of all Works as they are made (whether or not conceived or made jointly  with others). To the extent copyrightable, all Works shall be deemed to be \"works for hire\" and ISA shall be deemed to be the author thereof under  the U.S. Copyright Act. With respect to Works that do not constitute \"works for hire,\"  Rubicon, its employees, contractors, consultants and  agents do hereby assign to ISA or its designee all of their respective right, title and interest in and to such Works and all related patents, patent  applications, copyrights and copyright applications and does hereby agree that these obligations are binding upon their respective assigns,  executors, administrators and other legal representatives. Rubicon, its employees, contractors, consultants and agents do hereby waive all claims  to moral rights to the Works. During the Term and continuing thereafter, Rubicon does hereby agree to take all such further reasonable actions on  its own behalf and with respect to its employees, contractors, consultants and agents, including without limitation, the execution and delivery of  copyright applications, patent applications, declarations, oaths, formal assignments, assignments of priority rights, and powers of attorney, which  ISA may deem necessary or desirable in order to protect its rights and interests in and to the Works. If ISA is unable, after reasonable effort, to  secure any necessary signature on any such documents, any executive officer of ISA shall be entitled as agent and attorney-in-fact to execute  such documents.     5.3 Rubicon's Intellectual Property. As between ISA and Rubicon, all right, title and interest in and to the Rubicon Offerings and, subject  to the provisions of Section 5.2, any other Intellectual Property of Rubicon, including, without limitation, as used by Rubicon or ISA hereunder, all  goodwill associated therewith and the copyright and all other Intellectual Property rights inherent in or appurtenant to the foregoing are and shall  be the sole property of Rubicon. ISA acknowledges that, except as otherwise set forth herein, neither it nor any other persons or entities will by  virtue of this Agreement acquire any ownership interest in such Intellectual Property, or the Intellectual Property rights inherent in or appurtenant  to any of the foregoing, or any associated goodwill and that its rights thereunder are strictly limited to those specifically granted in this  Agreement. ISA shall not contest ownership by Rubicon of any of the foregoing. No license, release or other right is granted by implication,  estoppel or otherwise by Rubicon to ISA or any of ISA's affiliates except for the rights and licenses expressly granted under this Agreement.  Except for the rights and licenses expressly granted herein, Rubicon reserves all rights to the Rubicon Service Offerings, including, without  limitation, translation rights, rights of modification and rights to source code.     6. TERM AND TERMINATION; WITHDRAWAL.     6.1 Term. Unless terminated sooner, the term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and continue for three (3) years  thereafter (the \"Initial Term\") and shall automatically renew for additional one (1) year terms on the terms and conditions set forth herein (each a  \"Renewal Term\" and collectively, the \"Term\") unless either party gives the other Party Notice of its intention to terminate this Agreement ninety  (90) days before the end of the Initial Term or Renewal Term, if any.     6.2 Termination.     6.2.1 For Cause. Either Party may serve Notice to the other Party to terminate this Agreement immediately in the event any material  breach of a material provision of this Agreement by such other Party remains uncured 30 days in the case of a breach of a payment obligation, or  45 days for all other material breaches, after notice of such breach was received by such other Party.     6.2.2 For Bankruptcy. Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon Notice to the other Party in the event the other  Party (a) permanently ceases operations, (b) becomes or is declared insolvent or bankrupt, (c) is the subject of any proceeding related to its  liquidation or insolvency (whether voluntary or involuntary) that is not dismissed within 90 calendar days or (d) makes an assignment for the  benefit of creditors.     6.2.3 For Contesting Intellectual Property Rights. Either Party may terminate this Agreement upon ten Business Day's Notice to  the other Party in the event the other Party contests or challenges to a material degree any of the other Party's Intellectual Property rights referred  to in Sections 5.1, and 5.3, respectively.     7. NON-COMPETITION.     7.1 During the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on the later of (i) the end of the Initial Term and (ii) the date falling two  years after completion of the most recent services provided by Rubicon under clause 7 (the \"Non-Competition Period\") and in the ISA Geographic  Area, as defined below, Rubicon agrees not to in any capacity, engage or have a financial interest in any ISA Competing Business, as defined  below, or provide managerial, supervisory, administrative, or financial services relating to any ISA Competing Business, including making available  any information or funding to any such ISA Competing Business. Further, during the Non-Competition Period, Rubicon shall not solicit any\n\n\n\n\n\nemployee of ISA or any employee of any ISA Client. If a court determines that the foregoing restrictions are too broad or otherwise unreasonable  under applicable law, including with respect to time or space, the court is hereby requested and authorized by the Parties to revise the foregoing  restrictions to include the maximum restrictions allowable under applicable law. Rubicon acknowledges, however, that the Parties have negotiated  this Section and that the time limitations, the limitation on activities and the geographic limitations are reasonable in light of the circumstances  pertaining to ISA and this transaction. \"ISA Competing Business\" means any person or entity of any type whatsoever engaged in the business of providing data centre audit and data centre optimization services. \"ISA Geographic Area\" means worldwide.     7.2 During the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on the later of (i) the end of the Initial Term and (ii) the date falling two  years after completion of the most recent services provided by Rubicon under clause 7 (the \"Non-Competition Period\")  and in the Rubicon  Geographic Area, as defined below, ISA agrees not to in any capacity, engage or have a financial interest in any Rubicon Competing Business, as  defined below, or provide managerial, supervisory, administrative, or financial services relating to any Rubicon Competing Business, including  making available any information or funding to any such Rubicon Competing Business. Further, during the Non-Competition Period, ISA shall not  solicit any employee of Rubicon or any employee of any Rubicon Client. If a court determines that the foregoing restrictions are too broad or  otherwise unreasonable under applicable law, including with respect to time or space, the court is hereby requested and authorized by the Parties  to revise the foregoing restrictions to include the maximum restrictions allowable under applicable law. ISA acknowledges, however, that the Parties have negotiated this Section and that the time limitations, the limitation on activities and the geographic limitations are reasonable in light of the circumstances pertaining to Rubicon and this transaction. \"Rubicon Competing Business\"  means any person or entity of any type  whatsoever engaged in the business of providing software development services for clients. \"Rubicon Geographic Area\" means Europe.     7.3 In the event that ISA wishes to carry out any software development work of any nature during the Non-Competition Period, it will  notify Rubicon of the same and allow Rubicon the opportunity to pitch for such work.        8. CONFIDENTIALITY.     8.1 Confidentiality Obligations. Except as permitted elsewhere under this Agreement, each Party agrees (a) to take Reasonable Steps (as  defined below) to receive and maintain the Confidential Information of the other Party in confidence, (b) to take Reasonable Steps (as defined  below) not to disclose such Confidential Information to any third parties other than with the written consent of the disclosing Party and (c) to  promptly notify the other Party upon learning of any law, rule, regulation or court order that purports to compel disclosure of any Confidential  Information of the other Party and to reasonably cooperate with the other Party in the exercise of the other Party's right to protect the  confidentiality of such Confidential Information, including, but not limited to, seeking to dispute the cause of such disclosure and/or to receive confidential treatment for the Confidential Information disclosed as a result of such cause. Neither Party shall use all or any part of the Confidential  Information of the other Party for any purpose other than to perform its obligations, or the exercise of such Party's rights and licenses, under this  Agreement. Each Party shall (i) limit access to any Confidential Information of the other Party received by it to its employees, contractors,  consultants and agents who have a need-to-know in connection with the performance of such Party's obligations, or the exercise of such Party's rights, under this Agreement; and (ii) advise such employees, contractors, consultants and agents of the confidential nature thereof and of the  obligations set forth in this Agreement and similarly bind them in writing. Each Party shall be responsible for any breaches of the obligations of  confidentiality and restricted use set forth herein by any employee, contractor, consultant or agent to whom such Party disclosed any Confidential  Information of the other Party. As used herein, \"Reasonable Steps\" means using at least the same degree of care that the receiving Party uses to  protect its own Confidential Information, and, in any event, no less than reasonable care.      8.2 Exclusions. Nothing contained herein shall prevent a Party from disclosing Confidential Information pursuant to any applicable law or  by a governmental order, decree, regulation, rule, process or court order; provided, however, that such Party complies with the notice provisions  of Section 8.1(c) to the extent permissible under applicable laws, rules, regulations or court orders. Such disclosure shall not of itself alter the  status of such information hereunder for all other purposes as Confidential Information.     8.3 Provisions of this Agreement. Each Party agrees that the provisions of this Agreement shall be treated as Confidential Information  and that no reference shall be made thereto without the prior written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld) except (a) to its accountants, banks, financing sources, lawyers and other professional advisors, provided that such parties undertake in  writing (or are otherwise bound by rules of professional conduct) to keep such information strictly confidential, (b) in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement, (c) in connection with a merger, acquisition or proposed merger or acquisition, or (d) pursuant to joint press  releases prepared in good faith or (e) as permitted under Section 8.2. The Parties will consult with each other, in advance, with regard to the terms  of all proposed press releases, public announcements and other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.     8.4 Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement, all Confidential Information shall be returned to the disclosing Party or destroyed  unless otherwise specified or permitted elsewhere under this Agreement or as otherwise mutually agreed upon by the Parties. The confidentiality  obligations contained in this Section 8 shall survive termination of this Agreement for a period of three years.     8.5 Injunction. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Section 8 are reasonable and necessary to protect the  other Party's interests in its Confidential Information, that any breach of the provisions of this Section 8 may result in irreparable harm to such  other Party, and in such event the exact amount of damages is now and will be difficult to ascertain and the remedies at law for any such failure  would not be reasonable or adequate. Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Section 8 by a Party  hereto, the other Party, in addition to any other relief available to it at law, in equity or otherwise, shall be entitled to seek temporary and permanent  injunctive relief restraining the breaching Party from engaging in and/or continuing such conduct, without the necessity of proving actual  damages or posting a bond or other security.

(b) Disaster Out If prior to the Closing Time there should develop, occur or come into effect or existence any event, action, state, condition or major financial occurrence of national or international consequence or any law or regulation which, in the opinion of any of the Agents, seriously adversely affects, or involves, or will seriously adversely affect, or involve, the financial markets or the business, operations or affairs of the Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, then such Agent shall be entitled, at its option and in accordance with Section 10(e), to terminate its obligations under this Agreement by written notice to that effect given to the Corporation at any time at or prior to the Closing Time. (c) Material Change or Change in Material Fact Out If, after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Time, there shall occur any material change or change in a material fact which, in the reasonable opinion of any of the Agents, would be expected to have a significant adverse effect on the business, affairs, prospects or financial condition of the Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or the market price or value of the securities of the Corporation, then such Agent shall be entitled, at its option, in accordance with Section 10(e), to terminate its obligations under this Agreement by written notice to that effect given to the Corporation any time at or prior to the Closing Time.

Each Agent may waive, in whole or in part, or extend the time for compliance with, any terms and conditions without prejudice to its rights in respect of any other terms and conditions or any other or subsequent breach or non- compliance, provided that any such waiver or extension shall be binding upon an Agent only if such waiver or extension is in writing and signed by the Agent. 20\n\n(e) Exercise of Termination Rights The rights of termination contained in Sections 10(a), (b), (c) and (d) may be exercised by any of the Agents and are in addition to any other rights or remedies any of the Agents may have in respect of any default, act or failure to act or non- compliance by the Corporation in respect of any of the matters contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise.

A notice of termination given by an Agent under Section 10(a), (b), (c) or (d) shall not be binding upon any other Agent who has not also executed such notice. 11.

(2) Notwithstanding Subsection 11(a) (1), the indemnification in Subsection 11(a)(1) does not and shall not apply to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment that has become non- appealable shall determine that (a) the Agents and their respective affiliates have been negligent or have committed any fraudulent or illegal act in the course of the professional services rendered to the Corporation, and (b) such expenses, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions were caused or incurred by the gross negligence, fraud or wilful misconduct of the Agents. (3) If any matter or thing contemplated by this Section 11 shall be asserted against any Indemnified Party in respect of which indemnification is or might reasonably be considered to be provided, such Indemnified Party will notify the Corporation in writing as soon as possible of the nature of such claim (provided that omission to so notify the Corporation will not relieve the Corporation of any liability that it may otherwise have to the Indemnified Party hereunder, except to the extent the Corporation is materially prejudiced by such omission) and the Corporation shall be entitled (but not required) to assume the defence of any suit brought to enforce such claim; provided, however, that the defence shall be through legal counsel reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Party and that no settlement may be made by the Corporation or such Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the other, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. 22\n\n\n\n\n\n(4) In any such claim, such Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain other legal counsel to act on such Indemnified Party's behalf, provided that the fees and disbursements of such other legal counsel shall be paid by such Indemnified Party, unless: (a) the employment of such counsel has been authorized by the Corporation; or (b) the Corporation has not assumed the defence and employed counsel thereof promptly after receiving notice of such claim; or (c) the named parties to any such claim include both the Indemnified Party and the Corporation, and the Indemnified Party has been advised by legal counsel thereto that representation of both the Corporation and the Indemnified Party by the same legal counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them; or (d) there are one or more defences available to the Indemnified Party which are different from and in addition to those available to the Corporation, provided that the Corporation shall not be responsible for the fees or expenses of more than one legal firm in any single jurisdiction for all of the Indemnified Parties. (5) To the extent that any Indemnified Party is not a party to this Underwriting Agreement, the Agents shall obtain and hold the right and benefit of this Section 11 in trust for and on behalf of such Indemnified Party. (6) The Corporation hereby consents to personal jurisdiction in any court in which any claim that is subject to indemnification hereunder is brought against the Agents or any Indemnified Party and to the assignment of the benefit of this Section 11 to any Indemnified Party for the purpose of enforcement provided that nothing herein shall limit the Corporation's right or ability to contest the appropriate jurisdiction or forum for the determination of any such claims. (7) The rights of the Corporation contained in this Section 11 shall not enure to the benefit of any Indemnified Party if the Agents were provided with a copy of any amendment or supplement to this Agreement which corrects any untrue statement or omission or alleged omission that is the basis of a claim by a party against such Indemnified Party and that is required, under the Applicable Securities Laws, to be delivered to such party by the Agents. (8) The Corporation shall not be liable under this Section 11 for any settlement of any claim or action effected without its prior written consent. 23\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Notification of Claims If any matter or thing contemplated by Section 11(a) (any such matter or thing being referred to as a \"Claim\") is asserted against any person or company in respect of which indemnification is or might reasonably be considered to be provided, such person or company (the \"Indemnified Party\") will notify the Corporation as soon as possible of the nature of such Claim (but the omission so to notify the Corporation of any potential Claim shall not relieve the Corporation from any liability which they may have to any Indemnified Party and any omission so to notify the Corporation of any actual Claim shall affect the Corporation's liability only to the extent that the Corporation is materially prejudiced by that failure). The Corporation shall assume the defence of any suit brought to enforce such Claim, provided, however, that (i) the defence shall be conducted through legal counsel acceptable to the Indemnified Party, acting reasonably, and (ii) no settlement of any such Claim or admission of liability may be made by the Corporation without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, acting reasonably, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act, by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party. (c) Right of Indemnity in Favour of Others With respect to any Indemnified Party who is not a party to this Agreement, the Agents shall obtain and hold the rights and benefits of this Section 11 in trust for and on behalf of such Indemnified Party. (d) Retaining Counsel In any such Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain one separate counsel to act on his or its behalf, provided that the fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party unless: (i) the Corporation and the Indemnified Party shall have mutually agreed in writing to the retention of the other counsel; (ii) the named parties to any such Claim (including any added third or impleaded party) include both the Indemnified Party and the Corporation and the Indemnified Party shall have been advised in writing by counsel to the Indemnified Party that the representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to an actual or potential conflict of interest between the Corporation and the Indemnified Party; or (iii) the Corporation shall not have retained counsel within seven Business Days following receipt by the Corporation of notice of any such Claim from the Indemnified Party; provided that the Corporation shall not be responsible for the fees or expenses of more than one legal firm in any single jurisdiction for all of the Indemnified Parties. 24\n\n\n\n\n\n12. Contribution (a) Rights of Contribution In order to provide for a just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity provided in Section 11 would otherwise be available in accordance with its terms but is, for any reason, held to be unavailable to or unenforceable by the Agents or enforceable otherwise than in accordance with its terms, the Corporation and the Agents shall contribute to the aggregate of all claims, expenses, costs and liabilities and all losses (other than loss of profits) of a nature contemplated by Section 11 in such proportions so that the Agents shall be responsible for the portion represented by the percentage that the aggregate Agents' Fee hereunder bears to the aggregate offering price of the Offered Shares being sold by the Corporation and the Corporation shall be responsible for the balance, whether or not they have been sued together or sued separately, provided, however, that (i) the Agents shall not in any event be liable to contribute, in the aggregate, any amounts in excess of the aggregate Agents' Fee actually received by the Agents from the Corporation under this Agreement; (ii) each Agent shall not in any event be liable to contribute, individually, any amount in excess of such Agents' portion of the aggregate Agents' Fee actually received from the Corporation under this Agreement; and (iii) no party who has engaged in any fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, wilful misconduct or negligence shall be entitled to claim contribution from any person who has not engaged in such fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, wilful misconduct or negligence. (b) Rights of Contribution in Addition to Other Rights The rights to contribution provided in this Section 12 shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other right to contribution which the Agents may have by statute or otherwise at law. (c) Right of Contribution in Favour of Others With respect to this Section 12, the Corporation acknowledges and agrees that the Agents are contracting on their own behalf and as agents for their affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents. For purposes of this Section 12, each person, if any, who controls an Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the U.S. Securities Act or Section 20 of the U.S. Exchange Act and each Agents' affiliates and selling agents shall have the same rights to contribution as such Agent and each person, if any, who controls the Corporation within the meaning of Section 15 of the U.S. Securities Act or Section 20 of the U.S. Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Corporation. The Agents' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 12 are several in proportion to the percentages of Agents' Fee set forth opposite their respective names in Section 5(a) hereof and not joint. 25\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Remedy Not Exclusive The remedies provided for in this Section 12 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any party at law or in equity. 13. Severability If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be void or unenforceable in whole or in part, it shall be deemed not to affect or impair the validity of any other provision of this Agreement and such void or unenforceable provision shall be severable from this Agreement. 14. Expenses (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be completed, all expenses of or incidental to the issue, sale and delivery of the Offered Shares and all expenses of or incidental to all other matters in connection with the offering of the Offered Shares shall be borne by the Corporation including, without limitation, all fees and disbursements of all legal counsel to the Corporation (including U.S., foreign and local counsel), all fees and disbursements of the Corporation's accountants and auditors, all expenses related to road shows and marketing activities, all printing costs incurred in connection with the offering of the Offered Shares, including certificates, if any, representing the Offered Shares, all filing fees, all fees and expenses relating to listing the Offered Shares on any exchanges, all transfer agent fees and expenses, and all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Agents incurred in connection with the offering of the Offered Shares, including without limitation the fees of Canadian counsel to the Agents which shall not exceed $50,000 (not including applicable taxes and disbursements and $10,000 USD plus tax and disbursements for U.S. Counsel), and any advertising, printing, courier, telecommunications, data search, presentation, travel and other expenses incurred by the Agents together with all related taxes (including, without limitation, provincial sales taxes and HST). (b) All expenses payable by the Corporation to the Agent in accordance with this Agreement shall be payable whether or not the Offering is completed. 15. Survival of Representations and Warranties The representations, warranties, obligations and agreements of the Corporation contained in this Agreement and in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with the purchase and sale of the Offered Shares shall survive the payment by the Agents for the Offered Shares, if any, and the distribution of the Offered Shares, and shall continue in full force and effect unaffected by the termination of the Agents' obligations and shall not be limited or prejudiced by any investigation made by or on behalf of the Agents in connection with the distribution of the Offered Shares. 26\n\n\n\n\n\n16.

Detto shall promptly notify PivX of any infringements of PivX's Property Rights that come to Detto's attention. PivX shall have the exclusive right to institute infringement or other appropriate legal action against alleged infringers of its Property Rights.

PivX shall provide Detto with at least forty-five (45) days written notice of any increase in the Per Copy Fees.\n\n3.3 PAYMENT. All payments to PivX shall be made within thirty (30) days after the receipt by Detto of the PivX's invoice. Detto shall pay PivX a late charge on outstanding amounts due equal to one and one-half percent (1.50%) per month or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is less. All payments shall be made in United States Dollars, free of any withholding tax and of any currency control or other restrictions to PivX. PivX shall have the right, at reasonable times and on reasonable notice, to inspect and audit the books and records of Detto to verify the accuracy of any statements. In the event that such an inspection discloses any error of any amount, the parties shall by appropriate payment promptly adjust for the error. If Detto fails to make payments when due, PivX shall be entitled to, in its sole discretion, to take any one or more of the following: (a) place Detto on credit hold, in which case, PivX may cease to fulfill Detto's orders to any new Third Parties; (b) rescind Detto's right to sell or distribute any additional Qwik-Fix Pro or Documentation hereunder; and (c) to require that Detto direct all future payments, for licenses sold in the past or in the future, from the Third Parties directly to PivX or a lock box or\n\n\n\n\n\nan account designated by PivX for such purpose, to be applied by PivX to the payment default (and interest thereon) until such defaults have been satisfied. All amounts received by PivX hereunder shall be nonrefundable except for any payments received or held under PivX's control pursuant to clause \"c\" of the last sentence after Detto's payment default has been satisfied.\n\n3.4 TAXES, TARIFFS, FEES.

Should any tax or levy be made, Detto agrees to pay such tax or levy and indemnify PivX against any claim for such amount. Detto represents and warrants to PivX that all Qwik-Fix Pro acquired hereunder is for redistribution in the ordinary course of Detto's business, and Detto agrees to provide PivX with appropriate resale certificate numbers and other documentation satisfactory to the applicable taxing authorities to substantiate any claim of exemption from any such taxes or fees.\n\n3.5 SHIPMENT AND DELIVERY. PivX shall electronically deliver Qwik-Fix Pro to Detto. Detto shall inspect all software delivered to it, upon receipt and shall, within 10 days of receipt, give written notice to PivX of any claim of damage or missing portions. Should Detto fail to give such notice, or fail to obtain an extension of such 10-day period from PivX, the packages shall be deemed to be accepted by Detto. PivX will reasonably accommodate Detto's request to replace its master copy of software that becomes corrupted or damaged. Detto shall contractually require its Third Parties to report any claim of damage or shortages for Qwik-Fix Pro shipped to them within thirty (30) days of the Third Parties receipt of such package (or the time required by applicable law, if longer). PivX shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet delivery dates requested by Detto, but in no event shall PivX be liable for its failure to meet such dates. In the event that PivX shall be unable to meet Detto's requested ship dates, PivX shall advise Detto of the change in or actual delivery schedule.\n\n                                       3\n\n3.6 SECURITY INTEREST.

To secure its rights hereunder, PivX shall have the right to file one or more UCC financing statements and to make such other filings as PivX shall deem appropriate. Detto shall cooperate with PivX with respect to all such filings. Upon PivX's demand, Detto agrees to execute promptly any financing statement, security agreement, chattel mortgage, applications for registration and/or similar documents, and to take any other action deemed necessary for registration or otherwise deemed necessary or desirable by PivX in order to perfect PivX's security interest hereunder.

Additionally, if an injunction or order issues restricting the use or distribution of any of Qwik-Fix Pro or Documentation, or if PivX determines that Qwik-Fix Pro or Documentation are likely to become the subject of a claim of infringement or violation of any proprietary right of any third party, PivX shall in its discretion and, at its option (a) procure the right to continue using, reproducing, and distributing Qwik-Fix Pro and Documentation; (b) replace or modify Qwik-Fix Pro and Documentation so that they become noninfringing, provided such modification or replacement does not materially alter or affect the specifications for or the use or operation of Qwik-Fix Pro; require return of Qwik-Fix Pro to PivX and refund any licensing fees relating to the future use of Qwik-Fix Pro.\n\n4.3 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. EXCEPT FOR PIVX'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 4.2, IN NO EVENT SHALL PIVX'S OR ITS LICENSORS' LIABILITY TO DETTO OR ANY THIRD PARTY ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY PIVX HEREUNDER DURING THE PREVIOUS SIX (6) MONTHS. IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY OR PIVX'S LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO ANOTHER PARTY OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR LOSS OF DATA, COSTS OF PROCUREMENTS OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES OR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES UNDER ANY CAUSE OF ACTION, EVEN IF\n\n\n\n\n\nSUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF AN ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY PROVIDED HEREIN.\n\n                                       4\n\n4.4 INDEMNIFICATION. Detto shall indemnify and hold PivX harmless from and against any and all damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) which PivX incurs as a result of any claim based on any breach of any representation or warranty, covenant or agreement by Detto under this Agreement or any breach of this Agreement by Detto; provided: (i) that PivX promptly gives written notice of any claim to Detto; (ii) at Detto's expense, PivX provides reasonable assistance which Detto may reasonably request for the defense of the claim; and (iii) Detto has the right to control the defense or settlement of the claim, provided, however, that PivX shall have the right to participate in, but not control, any litigation for which indemnification is sought with counsel of its own choosing, at its own expense.\n\n5.

This Agreement may be terminated by either party in the event of a material breach of this Agreement by the other party that is not cured within thirty (30) days of the other party's receipt of written notice of such breach. If a material breach is cured within a thirty (30) day cure period this Agreement shall remain in effect as if no material breach had occurred. This Agreement shall terminate automatically without notice and without further action by the other party in the event that the other party becomes insolvent, which means it becomes unable to pay its debts in the ordinary course of business as they come due, or makes an assignment of this Agreement for the benefit of creditors.\n\n5.3 EFFECT OF TERMINATION.

No modification, amendment, or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing signed by both parties. The failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or remedy under this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of any such right, power or remedy.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3 NOTICES. All notices shall be given in writing and shall be considered effective when (a) personally delivered, (b) upon confirmed receipt if sent by electronic mail or facsimile; or (c) two (2) days after posting if sent by overnight registered private carrier (e.g. DHL, Federal Express, etc.).\n\n6.4 ASSIGNMENT. Detto may not assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without PivX's prior written consent. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns.\n\n6.5 FORCE MAJEURE. PivX will not incur any liability to Detto or any other party on account of any loss or damage resulting from any delay or failure to perform all or any part of this Agreement (except for payment obligations) to the extent such delay or failure is caused, in whole or in part, by events, occurrences, or causes beyond the control, and without the negligence of, the parties. Such events, occurrences, or causes include, without limitation, acts of God, telecommunications outages, Internet outages, power outages, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war, floods, earthquakes, fires, and explosions.\n\n6.6 GENERAL. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such provision shall be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent allowed by law and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

(the \"Agent\") as follows:\n\nSection 1. The Offering. The Bank, in accordance with its plan of conversion adopted by its Board of Directors (the \"Plan\"), intends to convert  from a federally-chartered mutual savings bank to a federal stock savings bank (the \"Conversion\"), and issue all of its issued and outstanding  capital stock to the Company. The Conversion will be accomplished pursuant to federal law and the rules and regulations of the Office of Thrift  Supervision (the \"OTS\").

It is anticipated that shares not subscribed for in the Subscription and Community Offering may be offered to certain  members of the general public on a best efforts basis through a selected dealers agreement (the \"Syndicated Community Offering\") (the  Subscription Offering, Community Offering and Syndicated Community Offering are collectively referred to as the \"Offering\"). It is acknowledged  that the purchase of Shares in the Offering is subject to the maximum and minimum purchase limitations as described in the Plan and that the  Company may reject, in whole or in part, any orders received in the Community Offering or Syndicated Community Offering.\n\nIn connection with the Conversion and pursuant to the terms of the Plan as described in the Prospectus, immediately following the consummation  of the Conversion, subject to the approval of the Bank's depositors and compliance with certain conditions as may be imposed by regulatory  authorities, the Company will contribute $100,000 and 100,000 shares of Common Stock to the Athens Federal Foundation (the \"Foundation\") such  shares hereinafter being referred to as the (\"Foundation Shares\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"Commission\") a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-   )  (the \"Registration Statement\"), containing a prospectus relating to the Offering, for the registration of the Shares under the Securities Act of 1933  (the \"1933 Act\"), and has filed such amendments thereof and such amended prospectuses as may have been required to the date hereof. The term  \"Registration Statement\" shall include any documents incorporated by reference therein and all financial schedules and exhibits thereto, as  amended, including post-effective amendments. The prospectus, as amended, on file with the Commission at the time the Registration Statement  initially became effective is hereinafter called the \"Prospectus,\" except that if any Prospectus is filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c)  of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the \"1933 Act Regulations\") differing from the prospectus on file at the time  the Registration Statement initially became effective, the term \"Prospectus\" shall refer to the prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) from  and after the time said prospectus is filed with the Commission.\n\nIn accordance with Title 12, Part 563b of the Code of Federal Regulations (the \"Conversion Regulations\"), the Bank has filed with the OTS an  Application For Conversion on Form AC (the \"Form AC\"), including the Prospectus and the Conversion Valuation Appraisal Report prepared by  Keller & Company, Inc. (the \"Appraisal\") and has filed such amendments thereto as may have been required by the OTS. The Form AC has been  approved by the OTS and the related Prospectus has been authorized for use by the OTS. In addition, the Company has filed with the OTS its  Application H-(e)l-S (the \"Holding Company Application\") to become a savings and loan holding company under the Home Owners' Loan Act, as  amended (\"HOLA\") and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the \"Control Act Regulations\").\n\nSection 2. Retention and Compensation of Agent. Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company and the Bank hereby appoint  the Agent as their exclusive financial advisor and marketing agent (i) to utilize its best efforts to solicit subscriptions for Common Shares and to  advise and assist the Company and the Bank with respect to the Company's sale of the Shares in the Offering and (ii) to participate in the Offering  in the areas of market making and in syndicate formation (if necessary).\n\nOn the basis of the representations, warranties, and agreements herein contained, but subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the  Agent accepts such appointment and agrees to consult with and advise the Company and the Bank as to the matters set forth in the letter  agreement, dated June 9, 2009, between the Bank and the Agent (a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A) (the \"Engagement Letter\"). It is  acknowledged by the Company and the Bank that the Agent shall not be required to purchase any Shares or be obligated to take any action which  is inconsistent with all applicable laws, regulations, decisions or orders.\n\nThe obligations of the Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate upon termination of the Offering, but in no event later than 45 days after  the completion of the Subscription Offering (the \"End Date\"). All fees or expenses due to the Agent but unpaid will be payable to the Agent in  next day funds at the earlier of the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) or the End Date. In the event the Offering is extended beyond the End  Date, the Company and the Agent may agree to renew this Agreement under mutually acceptable terms.\n\nIn the event the Company is unable to sell a minimum of    Shares within the period herein provided, this Agreement shall terminate and the  Company shall refund to any persons who have subscribed for any of the Shares the full amount which it may have received from them plus  accrued interest, as set forth in the Prospectus; and none of the parties to this Agreement shall have any obligation to the other parties hereunder,  except as set forth in this Section 2 and in Sections 7, 9 and 10 hereof. In the event the Offering is terminated for any reason not attributable to the  action or inaction of the Agent, the Agent shall be paid the fees due to the date of such termination pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and (d) below.\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Agent shall receive the following compensation for its services hereunder:\n\n(a) A management fee of $30,000 payable in four consecutive monthly installments of $7,500 each commencing with the execution of the  Engagement Letter. This fee shall be deemed to have been earned when due and shall be non-refundable.\n\n(b) A success fee upon completion of the Offering of 1.125% of the aggregate purchase price of the Common Shares sold in the Subscription  Offering and Community Offering excluding shares purchased by the Bank's officers, directors, or employees (or members of their immediate  family), any ESOP, tax-qualified or stock-based compensation plans (except IRAs) or similar plan created by the Bank or the Company for some or  all of its directors or employees, or contributed to any charitable foundation established by the Bank in connection with the Conversion. In no  event shall the success fee paid for the sale of Common Stock in the Subscription and Community Offering be less than $200,000. The management  fee will be applied against the first success fee.\n\n(c) If any of the Common Shares remain available after the Subscription Offering, at the request of the Company, the Agent will seek to form a  syndicate of registered broker-dealers (\"Selected Dealers\") to assist in the sale of such Common Shares on a best efforts basis, subject to the  terms and conditions set forth in the selected dealers agreement. The Agent will endeavor to distribute the Common Shares among the Selected  Dealers in a fashion which best meets the distribution objectives of the Bank and the Plan. The Agent will be paid a fee not to exceed 5.5% of the  aggregate Purchase Price of the Shares sold in the Syndicated Community Offering. The Agent will pass onto the Selected Dealers who assist in  the Syndicated Community Offering an amount competitive with gross underwriting discounts charged at such time for comparable amounts of  stock sold at a comparable price per share in a similar market environment. Fees with respect to purchases effected with the assistance of Selected  Dealers other than the Agent shall be transmitted by the Agent to such Selected Dealers. The decision to utilize Selected Dealers will be made by  the Company upon consultation with the Agent.\n\n(d) The Company and the Bank shall reimburse the Agent for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including costs of travel, meals and lodging,  photocopying, telephone, facsimile and couriers. The Company and the Bank will reimburse the Agent for the fees and expenses of the Agent's  counsel which will not exceed $50,000. The Company will bear the expenses of the Offering customarily borne by issuers including, without  limitation, regulatory filing fees, SEC, \"Blue Sky,\" and FINRA filing and registration fees; the fees of the Company's accountants, attorneys,  appraiser, transfer agent and registrar, printing, mailing and marketing and syndicate expenses associated with the conversion; and the fees set  forth under this Section 2; and any fees for Blue Sky legal work.\n\nFull payment of the Agent's actual and accountable expenses, advisory fees and compensation shall be made in next day funds on the earlier of  the Closing Date or a determination by the Bank to terminate or abandon the Offering. The payment of such expenses assume no unusual  circumstances or delays, or a re-solicitation in connection with the subscription and community offering. The Company and the Bank acknowledge  that such expense cap may be increased by mutual consent, including in the event of a material delay in the Offering which would require an  update of the financial information in tabular form to reflect a period later than that set forth in the original filing.\n\nSection 3. Sale and Delivery of Shares. If all conditions precedent to the consummation of the Conversion, including without limitation, the sale of  all Shares required by the Plan to be sold, are satisfied, the Company agrees to issue, or have issued, the Shares sold in the Offering and to release  for delivery certificates for such Shares on the Closing Date against payment to the Company by any means authorized by the Plan; provided,  however, that no funds shall be released to the Company until the conditions specified in Section 8 hereof shall have been complied with to the  reasonable satisfaction of the Agent and its counsel. The release of Shares against payment therefor shall be made on a date and at a place  acceptable to the Company, the Bank and the Agent. Certificates for shares shall be delivered\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndirectly to the purchasers in accordance with their directions. The date upon which the Company shall release or deliver the shares sold in the  Offering, in accordance with the terms herein, is called the \"Closing Date.\"\n\nSection 4.

At the time the Registration Statement, including the Prospectus contained therein  (including any amendment or supplement), became effective, at the Applicable Time (as defined in Section 4(c) hereof) and at the Closing Date, the  Registration Statement complied and will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations and  the Registration Statement, including the Prospectus contained therein (including any amendment or supplement thereto), and any information  regarding the Company contained in Sales Information (as such term is defined in Section 9(a) hereof) authorized by the Company for use in  connection with the Offering, did not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or  necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and at the time any Rule 424 (b) or (c) Prospectus is filed with the Commission and at the Closing Date referred to in Section 2 hereof, the Prospectus (including any amendment  or supplement thereto) and any information regarding the Company contained in Sales Information (as such term is defined in Section 9(a) hereof)  authorized by the Company for use in connection with the Offering will contain all statements that are required to be stated therein in accordance  with the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary  in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that the  representations and warranties in this Section 4(a) shall not apply to statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with written  information furnished to the Company by the Agent or its counsel expressly regarding the Agent for use in the Prospectus under the caption \"The  Conversion and Stock Offering \u2014 Marketing Arrangements\" or statements in or omissions from any Sales Information or information filed  pursuant to state securities or blue sky laws or regulations regarding the Agent.\n\n(b) At the time of filing the Registration Statement relating to the offering of the Shares and at the date hereof, the Company was not, and is not, an  ineligible issuer, as defined in Rule 405 of the 1933 Act Regulations. At the time of the filing of the Registration Statement and at the time of the use  of any issuer free writing prospectus, as defined in Rule 433(h) of the 1933 Act Regulations, the Company met the conditions required by Rules 164  and 433 of the 1933 Act Regulations for the use of a free writing prospectus. If required to be filed, the Company has filed any issuer free writing  prospectus related to the offered Shares at the time it is required to be filed under Rule 433 of the 1933 Act Regulations and, if not required to be  filed, will retain such free writing prospectus in the Company's records pursuant to Rule 433(g) of the 1933 Act Regulations and if any issuer free  writing prospectus is used after the date hereof in connection with the offering of the Shares the Company will file or retain such free writing  prospectus as required by Rule 433 of the 1933 Act Regulations.\n\n(c) As of the Applicable Time, neither (i) the Issuer-Represented General Free Writing Prospectus(es) issued at or prior to the Applicable Time and  the Statutory Prospectus, all considered together (collectively, the \"General Disclosure Package\"), nor (ii) any individual Issuer-Represented  Limited-Use Free Writing Prospectus, when considered together with the General Disclosure Package, included any untrue statement of a material  fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were  made, not misleading. The preceding sentence does not apply to statements in or omissions from any Prospectus included in the Registration  Statement relating to the offered Securities or any Issuer-Represented Free\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting Prospectus based upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Agent specifically for use therein. As  used in this paragraph and elsewhere in this Agreement:\n\n1. \"Applicable Time\" means each and every date when a potential purchaser submitted a subscription or otherwise committed to purchase  Securities.\n\n2. \"Statutory Prospectus\", as of any time, means the Prospectus relating to the offered Shares that is included in the Registration Statement  relating to the offered Shares immediately prior to the Applicable Time, including any document incorporated by reference therein.\n\n3. \"Issuer-Represented Free Writing Prospectus\" means any \"issuer free writing prospectus,\" as defined in Rule 433(h) of the 1933 Act  Regulations, relating to the offered Shares in the form filed or required or, if not required to be filed, in the form retained in the Company's records  pursuant to Rule 433(g) under the 1933 Act Regulations. The term does not include any writing exempted from the definition of prospectus  pursuant to clause (a) of Section 2(a)(10) of the 1933 Act, without regard to Rule 172 or Rule 173 of the 1933 Act Regulations.\n\n4. \"Issuer-Represented General Free Writing Prospectus\" means any Issuer-Represented Free Writing Prospectus that is intended for general  distribution to prospective investors.\n\n5. \"Issuer-Represented Limited-Use Free Writing Prospectus\" means any Issuer-Represented Free Writing Prospectus that is not an Issuer- Represented General Free Writing Prospectus. The term Issuer-Represented Limited-Use Free Writing Prospectus also includes any \"bona fide  electronic road show,\" as defined in Rule 433 of the 1933 Act Regulations, that is made available without restriction pursuant to Rule 433(d)(8)(ii)  of the 1933 Act Regulations or otherwise, even though not required to be filed with the Commission.\n\n6. \"Permitted Free Writing Prospectus\" means any free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 405 of the 1933 Act Regulations that is consented to  by the Company, the Bank and the Agent.\n\n(d) Each Issuer-Represented Free Writing Prospectus, as of its date of first use and at all subsequent times through the completion of the Offering  and sale of the offered Shares or until any earlier date that the Company notified or notifies the Agent (as described in the next sentence), did not,  does not and will not include any information that conflicted, conflicts or will conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement,  including any document incorporated by reference therein that has not been superseded or modified. If at any time following the date of first use  of an Issuer-Represented Free Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer-Represented  Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement relating to the offered Shares or  included or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the  statements therein, in the light of the circumstances prevailing at that subsequent time, not misleading, the Company has notified or will notify  promptly the Agent so that any use of such Issuer-Represented Free-Writing Prospectus may cease until it is amended or supplemented and the  Company has promptly amended or will promptly amend or supplement such Issuer-Represented Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct  such conflict, untrue statement or omission.

No order has been issued by the OTS or the FDIC preventing or\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsuspending the use of the Prospectus or the proxy statement, and no action by or before any such government entity to revoke any approval,  authorization or order of effectiveness related to the Offering is pending or threatened. At the time of the approval of the Form AC, including the  Prospectus (including any amendment or supplement thereto) by the OTS and at all times subsequent thereto until the Closing Date, the Form AC,  including the Prospectus (including any amendment or supplement thereto), will comply in all material respects with the Conversion Regulations,  except to the extent waived or otherwise approved by the OTS. The Form AC, including the Prospectus (including any amendment or supplement  thereto), does not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make  the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that the representations and  warranties in this Section 4(e) shall not apply to statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information  furnished to the Company by the Agent or its counsel expressly regarding the Agent for use in the Prospectus contained in the Form AC under  the caption \"The Conversion and Stock Offering \u2014 Marketing Arrangements.\"\n\n(f) The Company has filed the Holding Company Application with the OTS and the Holding Company Application is accurate and truthful. The  Company has received written notice from the OTS of its approval of the acquisition of the Bank, such approval remains in full force and effect and  no order has been issued by the OTS suspending or revoking such approval and no proceedings therefor have been initiated or threatened by the  OTS.

No approval of any other regulatory or  supervisory or other public authority is required in connection with the distribution of the Prospectus and any supplemental sales literature that  has not been obtained and a copy of which has been delivered to the Agent. The Company and the Bank have not distributed any offering  material in connection with the Offering except for the Prospectus and any supplemental sales material that has been filed with the Registration  Statement and the Form AC and authorized for use by the Commission and the OTS. The information contained in the supplemental sales material  filed as an exhibit to both the Registration Statement and the Form AC does not conflict with information contained in the Registration Statement  and the Prospectus.\n\n(h) The Plan has been adopted by the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank and, at the Closing Date, will have been approved by the  members of the Bank, and the offer and sale of the Shares will have been conducted in all material respects in accordance with the Plan, the  Conversion Regulations except to the extent waived or otherwise approved by the OTS, and all other applicable laws, regulations, decisions and  orders, including all terms, conditions, requirements and provisions precedent to the Offering imposed upon the Company and the Bank by the  OTS, the Commission, or any other regulatory authority and in the manner described in the Prospectus.

(ii) arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in any of the  foregoing documents or information a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the  circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (iii) arise from any theory of liability whatsoever relating to or arising from or based  upon the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement  thereto), the General Disclosure Package, any Issuer-Represented Limited-Use Free Writing Prospectus, the Form AC (or any amendment or  supplement thereto) the Holding Company Application (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information  or other documentation distributed in connection with the Conversion; provided, however, that no indemnification is required under this  paragraph (a) to the extent such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue material statement or  alleged untrue material statement in, or material omission or alleged material omission from, the Registration Statement (or any amendment or  supplement thereto), preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the General Disclosure Package, any Issuer- Represented Limited-Use Free Writing Prospectus, the Form AC, the Holding Company Application, any Blue Sky Application or Sales  Information made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company, by the Agent or its counsel regarding  the Agent, and provided, that it is agreed and understood that the only information furnished in writing to the Company, by the Agent regarding  the Agent is set forth in the Prospectus under the caption \"The Conversion and Stock Offering \u2014 Marketing Arrangements\"; and, provided  further, that such indemnification shall be limited to the extent prohibited by the Commission, the OTS, the FDIC and the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System.\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) The Agent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Bank, their directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls  the Company or the Bank within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim,  damage or expense whatsoever (including but not limited to settlement expenses), joint or several, which they, or any of them, may suffer or to  which they, or any of them may become subject under all applicable federal and state laws or otherwise, and to promptly reimburse the Company,  the Bank, and any such persons upon written demand for any expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by  them, or any of them, in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any actions, proceedings or claims (whether commenced or  threatened) to the extent such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions: (i) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged  untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Form AC (or any  amendment or supplement thereto), the Holding Company Application, the preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement  thereto), any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information, (ii) are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in any of the foregoing  documents a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which  they were made, not misleading, or (iii) arise from any theory of liability whatsoever relating to or arising from or based upon the Registration  Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Form AC (or  any amendment or supplement thereto), the Holding Company Application, or any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information or other  documentation distributed in connection with the Offering; provided, however, that the Agent's obligations under this Section 9(b) shall exist only if and only to the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement was made in, or such material fact or alleged material fact was  omitted from, the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or  supplement thereto), the Form AC (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Holding Company Application, any Blue Sky Application or  Sales Information in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company or the Bank, by the Agent or its counsel  regarding the Agent, and provided, that it is agreed and understood that the only information furnished in writing to the Company or the Bank, by  the Agent regarding the Agent is set forth in the Prospectus under the caption \"The Conversion and Stock Offering \u2014 Marketing Arrangements.\"\n\n(c) Each indemnified party shall give prompt written notice to each indemnifying party of any action, proceeding, claim (whether commenced or  threatened), or suit instituted against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall  not relieve it from any liability which it may have on account of this Section 9 or otherwise. An indemnifying party may participate at its own  expense in the defense of such action. In addition, if it so elects within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, an indemnifying party, jointly  with any other indemnifying parties receiving such notice, may assume defense of such action with counsel chosen by it and approved by the  indemnified parties that are defendants in such action, unless such indemnified parties reasonably object to such assumption on the ground that  there may be legal defenses available to them that are different from or in addition to those available to such indemnifying party. If an indemnifying  party assumes the defense of such action, the indemnifying parties shall not be liable for any fees and expenses of counsel for the indemnified  parties incurred thereafter in connection with such action, proceeding or claim, other than reasonable costs of investigation. In no event shall the  indemnifying parties be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (and any special counsel that said firm may  retain) for each indemnified party in connection with any one action, proceeding or claim or separate but similar or related actions, proceedings or  claims in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.\n\nSection 10. Contribution. In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in  Section 9 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Company, the Bank or the Agent, the  Company, the Bank and the Agent shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(including any investigation, legal and other expenses incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or  proceeding, but after deducting any contribution received by the Company, the Bank or the Agent from persons other than the other parties  thereto, who may also be liable for contribution) in such proportion so that the Agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage  that the fees paid to the Agent pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement (not including expenses) bears to the gross proceeds received by the  Company from the sale of the Shares in the Offering, and the Company and the Bank shall be responsible for the balance. If, however, the  allocation provided above is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by  such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative fault of the Company and the Bank on the one hand  and the Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions,  proceedings or claims in respect thereto), but also the relative benefits received by the Company and the Bank on the one hand and the Agent on  the other from the Offering (before deducting expenses). The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the  untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by  the Company and the Bank on the one hand or the Agent on the other and the parties' relative intent, good faith, knowledge, access to information  and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Bank and the Agent agree that it would not be just and  equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10 were determined by pro-rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not  take into account the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 10. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result  of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, proceedings or claims in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 10 shall be  deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any  such action, proceeding or claim. It is expressly agreed that the Agent shall not be liable for any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense or be  required to contribute any amount pursuant to Section 9(b) or this Section 10 which in the aggregate exceeds the amount paid (excluding  reimbursable expenses) to the Agent under this Agreement. It is understood that the above stated limitation on the Agent's liability is essential to  the Agent and that the Agent would not have entered into this Agreement if such limitation had not been agreed to by the parties to this  Agreement. No person found guilty of any fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to  contribution from any person who was not found guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Company, the Bank and the  Agent under this Section 10 and under Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company and the Agent may otherwise have. For  purposes of this Section 10, each of the Agent's, the Company's or the Bank's officers and directors and each person, if any, who controls the  Agent or the Company or the Bank within the meaning of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Agent on  the one hand, or, the Company or the Bank on the other hand. Any party entitled to contribution, promptly after receipt of notice of  commencement of any action, suit, claim or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against  another party under this Section 10, will notify such party from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party shall  not relieve the party from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it may have hereunder or otherwise than under this Section  10.\n\nSection 11. Survival of Agreements, Representations and Indemnities. The respective indemnities of the Company, the Bank and the Agent, the  representations and warranties and other statements of the Company, the Bank and the Agent set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement and  the provisions relating to contribution shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any  investigation made by or on behalf of the Agent, the Company, the Bank or any controlling person referred to in Section 9 hereof, and shall  survive the termination of this Agreement and the issuance of the Shares, and any successor or assign of the Agent, the Company and the Bank,  and any such controlling person shall be entitled to the benefit of the respective agreements, indemnities, warranties and representations.\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 12. Termination. The Agent may terminate this Agreement by giving the notice indicated below in this Section 12 at any time after this  Agreement becomes effective as follows:\n\n(a) If any domestic or international event or act or occurrence has materially disrupted the United States securities markets such as to make it, in  the Agent's reasonable opinion, impracticable to proceed with the offering of the Shares; or if trading on the NYSE shall have suspended (except  that this shall not apply to the imposition of NYSE trading collars imposed on program trading); or if the United States shall have become involved  in a war or major hostilities; or if a general banking moratorium has been declared by a state or federal authority which has a material effect on the  Company on a consolidated basis; or if a moratorium in foreign exchange trading by major international banks or persons has been declared; or if  there shall have been a material adverse change in the financial condition, results of operations or business of the Bank, or if the Bank shall have  sustained a material or substantial loss by fire, flood, accident, hurricane, earthquake, theft, sabotage or other calamity or malicious act, whether or  not said loss shall have been insured; or if there shall have been a material adverse change in the financial condition, results of operations or  business of the Bank.\n\n(b) In the event the Company fails to sell the required minimum number of the Shares by the date when such sales must be completed, in  accordance with the provisions of the Plan or as required by the Conversion Regulations, and applicable law, this Agreement shall terminate upon  refund by the Company to each person who has subscribed for or ordered any of the Shares the full amount which it may have received from such  person, together with interest as provided in the Prospectus, and no party to this Agreement shall have any obligation to the other hereunder,  except as set forth in Sections 2(a) and (d), 7, 9 and 10 hereof.\n\n(c) If any of the conditions specified in Section 8 shall not have been fulfilled when and as required by this Agreement, unless waived in writing, or  by the Closing Date, this Agreement and all of the Agent's obligations hereunder may be cancelled by the Agent by notifying the Company of  such cancellation in writing or by telegram at any time at or prior to the Closing Date, and any such cancellation shall be without liability of any  party to any other party except as otherwise provided in Sections 2(a), 2(d), 7, 9 and 10 hereof.\n\n(d) If the Agent elects to terminate this Agreement as provided in this Section, the Company and the Bank shall be notified promptly by telephone  or telegram, confirmed by letter.\n\nThe Company or the Bank may terminate this Agreement in the event the Agent is in material breach of the representations and warranties or  covenants contained in Section 5 and such breach has not been cured after the Company or the Bank has provided the Agent with notice of such  breach.\n\nThis Agreement may also be terminated by mutual written consent of the parties hereto.\n\nSection 13. Notices. All communications hereunder, except as herein otherwise specifically provided, shall be mailed in writing and if sent to the  Agent shall be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc., Investment Banking, 10 South Wacker Drive,  Suite 3400, Chicago, Illinois 60606, Attention: Harold T.

It is understood and agreed that this Agreement is  the exclusive agreement among the parties hereto, and supersedes any prior agreement among the parties and may not be varied except in writing  signed by all the parties.\n\nSection 15. Closing. The closing for the sale of the Shares shall take place on the Closing Date at such location as mutually agreed upon by the  Agent and the Company and the Bank. At the closing, the Company and the Bank shall deliver to the Agent in next day funds the commissions,  fees and expenses due and owing to the Agent as set forth in Sections 2 and 7 hereof and the opinions and certificates required hereby and other  documents deemed reasonably necessary by the Agent shall be executed and delivered to effect the sale of the Shares as contemplated hereby  and pursuant to the terms of the Prospectus.\n\nSection 16.

Term and Termination     7.1 Term     Unless earlier terminated as provided below, this IP Agreement shall extend until the last date of expiration of the SRAM  Intellectual Property rights licensed under this IP Agreement.     7.2 Termination     (a) Should either Party fail to observe faithfully and materially perform each of the material obligations assumed by it in this IP  Agreement for thirty (30) days after its attention has been directed to any such breach by notice in writing from the other Party, the non-breaching  Party shall, at its option, have the right to terminate the license granted by it under this Agreement, such termination to be effected by serving  notice in writing upon the breaching Party to that effect on or after the expiration of such period of thirty (30) days.     (b) Should PURCHASER assert against SONY a claim based on its Patents and/or Intellectual Property, SONY shall, at its option,  have the right to terminate the license granted by SONY hereunder, such termination to be effected by serving notice in writing upon  PURCHASER to that effect not less than thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such termination.     (c) Should SONY or any SONY Affiliate assert against PURCHASER a claim based on its Patents and/or Intellectual Property,  PURCHASER shall, at its option, have the right to terminate the license granted by PURCHASER hereunder, such termination to be effected by  serving notice in writing upon SONY to that effect not less than thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such termination.     7.3 Insolvency     The licenses granted to a Party under Section 3 hereof shall automatically terminate should such Party become adjudicated  insolvent by reason of failure to pay its debts when due, enter into bankruptcy proceeding for its liquidation, voluntarily or involuntarily, or make  any assignment for the benefit of any one or more creditors.     7\n\n\n\n\n\n     7.4 Continuing Obligations     Termination of the licenses granted hereunder shall not affect any liability of either of the Parties previously accruing under this  IP Agreement.     8. Representations and Warranties     SONY hereby makes the following representations and warranties to PURCHASER, each of which shall be true and correct as of  the date hereof and as of the Closing Date, and shall be unaffected by any investigation heretofore or hereafter made:     8.1 Power and Authority     SONY has the right and power to enter into this IP Agreement and to transfer the Transferred Patents and to grant the license  set forth in Section 3.1.     8.2 Essential Patents     The Transferred Patents listed on Exhibit A comprise the Patents, both U.S. and foreign, owned or claimed by SONY or any  SONY Affiliate, that are essential to the conduct of the Business as conducted by SONY.     8.3 Ownership     All of the Transferred Patents are owned solely by SONY. No Transferred Patent is jointly owned by SONY and any other  Person, nor is it owned or jointly owned by any SONY Affiliate.     8.4 Validity and Enforceability     Each of the Transferred Patents (excluding applications) is subsisting, and, to the Knowledge of SONY, valid and in full force  and effect (except with respect to applications), and has not expired or been cancelled or abandoned. All necessary documents and certifications in  connection with each Transferred Patent (excluding applications) have been filed with the relevant patent, copyright or other authorities in the  United States and foreign jurisdictions, as the case may be, for the purposes of avoiding abandonment, prosecuting and maintaining of      8\n\n\n\n\n\n     Transferred Patents (excluding applications). Except for actions of the relevant jurisdiction's patent and trademark office or other government  intellectual property office (\"Office Actions\"), SONY has not, to the Knowledge of SONY, received written notice of any pending or threatened  (and at no time within the two years prior to the Effective Date has there been pending any) action before any court, governmental authority or  arbitral tribunal in any jurisdiction challenging the use, ownership, validity, enforceability or registerability of any of the Transferred Patents.  Rejections of pending applications before a national patent, trademark or intellectual properly office will not constitute such written notice. Except  for Office Actions and broad Patent portfolio cross license agreements that SONY has signed with third parties (\"Portfolio Cross Licenses\"),  neither SONY nor any Affiliate of SONY is, to the Knowledge of SONY, a party to any settlements, covenants not to sue, consents, decrees,  stipulations, judgments or orders resulting from actions which permit third parties to use any Transferred Patents or any other SRAM Intellectual  Property included in the Transferred Assets. SONY has the sole right to enforce all of the Transferred Patents and the other SRAM Intellectual  Property rights of SONY included in the Transferred Assets.     8.5 Sufficiency     To the Knowledge of SONY, SONY and each of SONY's Affiliates owns, or has valid rights to use, all the SRAM Intellectual  Property material to the conduct of the Business, including, without limitation, the design, development, manufacture, marketing, use, distribution,  import, supply, provision and sale of SRAM Products.     8.6 Non-infringement by the Business     As of the Effective Date, SONY has not received written notice of any pending or threatened (and at no time within the two  years prior to the date of this Agreement has there been, to the Knowledge of SONY, pending any) action alleging that the activities or the  conduct of the Business dilutes (solely with respect to trademark rights), misappropriates, infringes, violates or constitutes the unauthorized use  of, or will dilute (solely with respect to trademark rights), misappropriate, infringe upon, violate or constitute the unauthorized use of the  Intellectual Property of any third party, nor, to the Knowledge of SONY, does there exist any basis therefor. Except for Office Actions pertaining to  the Transferred Patents and Patent licenses      9\n\n\n\n\n\n     granted by SONY under Portfolio Cross Licenses, neither SONY nor any of SONY's Affiliates is, to the Knowledge of SONY, party to any  settlement, covenant not to sue, consent, decree, stipulation, judgment, or order resulting from any action which (i) restricts SONY's or any of its  Affiliate's rights to use any SRAM Intellectual Property in connection with the Business, (ii) restricts the Business in order to accommodate a third  party's Intellectual Property rights or (iii) requires any future payment by SONY or any SONY Affiliate.     8.7 Infringement by a Third Party     To the Knowledge of SONY, no third party is misappropriating, infringing, or violating any SRAM Intellectual Property material  to the conduct of the Business that is owned by or exclusively licensed to SONY or any SONY Affiliate, and no Intellectual Property or other  proprietary right, misappropriation, infringement or violation actions have been brought against any third party by SONY or any SONY Affiliate in  connection with the Business.     8.8 Intellectual Property Development     To the knowledge of SONY:     (a) Each Person who is or has been employed by SONY or any Affiliate of SONY at any time at or prior to the date hereof in  connection with the development of any SRAM Intellectual Property or technology material to the Business, or is or has provided consulting  services to SONY or any Affiliate of SONY in connection with the development of any SRAM Intellectual Property or technology material to the  Business at any time at or prior to the Effective Date, has signed an agreement containing appropriate confidentiality terms.     (b) Except in the exercise of SONY's business judgment, other than under an appropriate confidentiality or nondisclosure  agreement or contractual provision relating to confidentiality and nondisclosure, there has been no disclosure to any third party of material  confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets of SONY or any Affiliate of SONY related to any SRAM Product. All current and former  employees of SONY and each Affiliate of SONY who have made any material contributions to the development of any SRAM Product have signed  an invention assignment agreement that assigns ownership to SONY or have performed that work in the course, and within the scope, of their  employment.     10\n\n\n\n\n\n     (c) All consultants and independent contractors currently or previously engaged by SONY or its Affiliates who have made any  material contributions to the development of any SRAM Product (including, without limitation, all consultants and independent contractors who  have designed, written, or modified any firmware or software code contained in any SRAM Product) have entered into a work-made-for-hire  agreement or have otherwise assigned to SONY or a Affiliate of SONY (or a third party that previously conducted any business that forms any  part of the Business currently conducted by SONY and that has subsequently assigned its rights in such SRAM Product to SONY) all of their  right, title and interest (other than moral rights, if any) in and to the portions of such SRAM Product developed by them in the course of their work  for SONY or any Affiliate.     (d) Other than the employees, consultants and contractors referred to in this Section 8.8, no other Person has made or currently  is making any material contributions to the development of any SRAM Product.     8.9 Material Intellectual Property Agreements     Except for the SRAM Contracts assigned to and assumed by PURCHASER under the Asset Purchase Agreement and the  Portfolio Cross Licenses, there are no contracts, licenses or agreements between SONY or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any other  Person, on the other hand, with respect to any SRAM Intellectual Property material to the conduct of the Business, including any agreements with  respect to the manufacture or distribution of the SRAM Products.     8.10 Royalties     To the Knowledge of SONY, except for obligations under the SRAM Contracts assigned to and assumed by PURCHASER under  the Asset Purchase Agreement, neither SONY nor any Affiliate of SONY has any obligation to pay any third party any royalties or other fees for  the continued use of Intellectual Property which is specifically applicable to SRAM Products, and PURCHASER will not be obligated under any  contract or agreement to pay any royalties or other fees associated with SRAM Intellectual Property arising from the consummation of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement.     11\n\n\n\n\n\n     8.11 No Loss of Rights     The consummation by SONY of the transactions contemplated hereby will not result in any violation, loss or impairment of  ownership by SONY or any SONY Affiliate of, or impair or restrict the right of PURCHASER to use, any Transferred Patents or any other SRAM  Intellectual Property included in the Transferred Assets, and will not require the consent of any governmental authority or third party with respect  to any of Transferred Patents or any other SRAM Intellectual Property included in the Transferred Assets.     8.12 Transferability     All Transferred Patents will be fully transferable, alienable or licensable by PURCHASER from and after the Closing without  restriction and without payment of any kind to any third party other than requirements under applicable laws to file documents with and pay fees  to patent offices. There are no Liens on any of the Transferred Patents. (For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge that SONY's  licensees under Portfolio Cross Licenses already hold licenses to the Transferred Patents and do not need a license from PURCHASER to practice  the Transferred Patents.)     8.13 No SRAM Product Warranty Issues     To the Knowledge of SONY, each SRAM Product currently offered for sale by SONY (or its Affiliates, as the case may be)  conforms with all SONY datasheet specifications, except with respect to warranty claims made in the ordinary course of business. (For the  avoidance of doubt, epidemic failures or any substantial repeated failures of those products to comply with specifications that have not been  resolved are not in the ordinary course of business). SONY has not received written notice from any customer, reseller, OEM customer or  governmental authority alleging any such material non-conformance.     8.14 Disclaimer     NOTHING IN THIS IP AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE A REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY BY EITHER PARTY  OF THE VALIDITY OF ANY PATENT.

MusclePharm will promptly provide all information reasonably requested by Lender and/or its valuation firm in connection with the preparation and delivery of such report. MusclePharm shall not take any position for tax purposes inconsistent with such fair market value as so determined without the consent of Lender; provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude MusclePharm from utilizing a different method of calculating the fair market value of the Compensation Shares for financial accounting purposes if MusclePharm's Chief Financial Officer, audit committee and independent auditors shall determine in good faith that such alternative calculation of the fair market value of the Compensation Shares is required under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.   (c) In connection with the issuance of the Compensation Shares, but without limitation of Section 8(a) or the other terms and conditions in this Agreement, Lender hereby makes the following representations to MusclePharm regarding the Compensation Shares:   (i) Lender understands that, as of the date hereof, none of the Compensation Shares have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\"Securities Act\"), by reason of a specific exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act, the availability of which depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the investment intent and the accuracy of Lender's representations as expressed herein. Lender is acquiring all of the Compensation Shares for its own account, not as a nominee or agent, for investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution or public offering thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act.   (ii) Lender understands that all of the Compensation Shares will constitute \"restricted securities\" under the federal securities laws, inasmuch as it is being acquired from MusclePharm or such other company in one or more transactions not involving a public offering and that under such laws the Compensation Shares may not be resold without registration under the Securities Act or an exemption therefrom. The certificates representing the Compensation Shares will be endorsed with a legend to such effect. Lender has been informed and understands that (i) there are substantial restrictions on the transferability of the Compensation Shares, and (ii) no federal or state agency has made any finding or determination as to the fairness for public investment, nor any recommendation nor endorsement, of the Compensation Shares.   (iii)  Lender, or Lender's business and financial advisors, have substantial experience in evaluating and investing in private transactions of securities in companies similar to MusclePharm and such other company and Lender acknowledges that it can protect its own interests. Lender, or such advisors, have such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its acceptance of all of the Compensation Shares of MusclePharm as compensation or otherwise.\n\n\n\nSource: MUSCLEPHARM CORP, 10-K/A, 2/8/2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (iv) Lender is an \"accredited investor\" within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.   (v) Lender understands that all books, records, and documents of MusclePharm relating to it have been and remain available for inspection by him or his business and financial advisors upon reasonable notice. Lender confirms that all documents requested have been made available, and that it or such advisors have been supplied with all of the information concerning MusclePharm that has been requested. Lender confirms that it or such advisors have obtained sufficient information, in its and their judgment to evaluate the merits and risks of receipt of the Compensation Shares as compensation or otherwise. Lender confirms that it has had the opportunity to obtain such independent legal and tax advice and financial planning services as it has deemed appropriate prior to making a decision to enter this Agreement. In making each such decision, Lender has relied exclusively upon its experience and judgment, or that of such advisors, upon such independent investigations as it, or they, deemed appropriate, and upon information provided by MusclePharm in writing or found in the books, records, or documents of MusclePharm.   (vi) Lender is aware that the economic ownership of the Compensation Shares is highly speculative and subject to substantial risks. Lender is capable of bearing the high degree of economic risk and burdens of this venture, including, but not limited to, the possibility of a complete loss, the lack of a sustained and orderly public market, and limited transferability of the Compensation Shares, which may make the liquidation thereof impossible for the indefinite future.   (vii) The offer to issue the Compensation Shares as compensation to Lender was directly communicated to Lender or its business or financial advisors by such a manner that it or such advisors were able to ask questions of and receive answers from MusclePharm or a person acting on its behalf concerning this Agreement. At no time was Lender presented with or solicited by or through any leaflet, public promotional meeting, television advertisement, or any other form of general advertising.   (viii)  None of the following information has ever been represented, guaranteed, or warranted to Lender, expressly or by implication by any broker, MusclePharm, or agent or employee of the foregoing, or by any other person:   (1) The approximate or exact length of time that Lender will be required to remain as a holder of any of the Compensation Shares;   (2) The amount of consideration, profit, or loss to be realized, if any, as a result of owning any of the Compensation Shares; or   (3)  That the past performance or experience of MusclePharm, its officers, directors, associates, agents, affiliates, or employees or any other person will in any way indicate or predict economic results in connection with the plan of operations of MusclePharm or the return on any of the Compensation Shares.\n\n\n\nSource: MUSCLEPHARM CORP, 10-K/A, 2/8/2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (d) MusclePharm represents, warrants and covenants to Lender that:   (i) It has the full right, power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder; (ii) it has acquired all rights necessary to perform this Agreement and exploit the Licensed Products as contemplated herein; (iii) the Licensed Products, any element thereof, or any advertising, promotional or publicity materials supplied by Licensee or third parties hereunder will not contain any language or material which is obscene, libelous, slanderous or defamatory; and (iv) the use of the Licensed Product and the Lender's Name and Appearance rights as contemplated herein will not violate or infringe the copyright, trademark, or other rights of any third party.

California Business and Professions Code Sections 20000 through 20043 provide rights to you concerning termination or non-renewal of a franchise. If the Master Franchise Agreement contains provisions that are inconsistent with the law, the law will control.\n\n 2. The Master Franchise Agreement provides for termination upon bankruptcy. This provision may not be enforceable under Federal Bankruptcy Law (11 U.S.C.A. Sec. 101 et seq. ).\n\n 3. The Master Franchise Agreement contains covenants not to compete which extend beyond the termination of the agreement. These provisions may not be enforceable under California law.\n\n 4. Section 31125 of the California Corporation Code requires the franchisor to provide you with a disclosure document before asking you to agree to a material modification of an existing franchise.\n\n 5. Neither the franchisor, any person or franchise broker in Item 2 of the Disclosure Document is subject to any currently effective order of any national securities association or national securities exchange, as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.A. 79a et seq., suspending or expelling such persons from membership in such association or exchange.\n\n 6. The Master Franchise Agreement requires non-binding mediation. The mediation will occur in New York with the costs being borne by equally by the parties. Prospective franchisees are encouraged to consult private legal counsel to determine the applicability of California and federal laws (such as Business and Professions Code Section 20040.5 and Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281) to any provisions of a franchise agreement restricting venue to a forum outside the State of California.\n\n 7. The Master Franchise Agreement requires application of the laws of New York. This provision may not be enforceable under California law.\n\n 8. You must sign a general release if you renew or transfer your franchise. California Corporation Code 31512 voids a waiver of your rights under the Franchise Investment Law (California Corporations Code 31000 through 31516). Business and Professions Code 20010 voids a waiver of your rights under the Franchise Relations Act (Business and Professions Code 20000 through 20043).\n\n 9. THE CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE INVESTMENT LAW REQUIRES THAT A COPY OF ALL PROPOSED AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE SALE OF THE FRANCHISE BE DELIVERED TOGETHER WITH THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT.\n\n 10. The Master Franchise Agreement contains a liquidated damages clause. Under California Civil Code Section 1671, certain liquidated damages clauses are unenforceable.\n\n 11.

Products may only be returned by Distributor when accompanied by a return material authorization number issued by STAAR. Shipping expenses for Products returned by Distributor will be prepaid by Distributor. STAAR shall pay for the return or replacement shipment to Distributor of Products repaired or replaced under the Warranty. For Products returned for repair or replacement that are not covered under Warranty, STAAR's standard repair charges shall be applicable in addition to all shipping expenses. The above Warranty is contingent upon proper installation, use and maintenance of the Products and does not apply to Products which have been misused, mishandled, adulterated, repaired or modified without STAAR's written approval.

Without limiting Distributor's obligations under law, as between Distributor and STAAR, the decision of whether or not to recall any Product shall be made solely by STAAR. Distributor shall notify all customers who received the recalled Product and shall record all receipts of Product returned under any recall. Distributor shall maintain copies of recall notification letters and maintain distribution logs that detail where each Product was shipped by Distributor.\n\n6\n\nSource: STAAR SURGICAL CO, 10-Q, 8/1/2018\n\n\n\n\n\n10.3 Distributor shall fully document and inform STAAR in writing of any Complaints or other matters addressed in this Section 10.

Distributor shall respect such property rights of STAAR and comply with all local laws and regulations in respect thereof. Distributor shall also assist STAAR, at STAAR's request, in taking any steps necessary to defend such rights, and any reasonable expenses incurred in this regard by Distributor shall be reimbursed by STAAR. 11.3 Distributor shall at all times keep STAAR apprised of all Regulatory Requirements and any changes thereto and, on an annual basis, shall report to STAAR in writing of any such changes and confirm in such report that there have been no changes in any Regulatory Requirements other than as specified in the annual report. 11.4 Copies of all permits, licenses, sponsorships and registrations referred in Sections 11.1 and 11.2 shall be promptly forwarded to STAAR. 12.

The Software is protected by the U.S. Copyright. Act and by international copyright treaties. All Software, including documentation and any subsequent updates provided by Company to Distributor, is licensed only for use on the single Product on which the Software is first installed. Unauthorized copying of the Software is expressly forbidden, and Distributor agrees not to distribute copies of the Software to nonlicensed parties.

Thus, Distributor agrees that, in addition to any other remedy it may have, STAAR shall be entitled to enforce the specific performance of the obligations of Distributor under this Section and to seek both temporary and permanent injunctive relief (to the extent permitted by law) without the necessity of proving actual damages. Distributor shall be responsible for any breach of the provisions for this Section by any employee, agent or representative of Distributor. 13.
