Avoiding Cluster Administration Pitfalls on 19 November 2013. \nMQ Clustering was introduced in v5.1 and customers have adopted the clustering method of messaging for ease of admin. and workload balance. Certain rules apply for config and admin, which if not followed, cause adverse effects. This session discusses ways to avoid MQ Cluster administration mistakes. \n\nCONTENT\nAsk the Experts sessions are conducted in a question and answer format.

Should any special steps be taken when joining a multi-instance QM to a cluster? 37:24 Slide 17, Workload Balancing, how to troubleshoot imbalanced workload among the cluster? 39:26 Pertaining to HIPER APAR IV25030, would you only demote or refresh the full repositories if you're seeing this corruption? 43:27 Recently my servers moved data centers, when the queue managers and repositories came up in the new data center, their IP addresses were changed. What would be the best way to recover? 46:17 We run Queue Managers on a High Availability server, meaning that they may be started on different hosts. Can you explain why the Queue Managers shold not be shut down? 52:14 Clearing out the SYSTEM.CLUSTER.TRANSMIT.QUEUE, is there an updated Support Pack? 58:37 Imbalanced workload among Queue Managers in remote clusters, would destination sequence factors affect the load balancing? 01:03:41 We are running MQ 7.0.1.10 on Solaris 10 and run into an issue that a new qmgr on another server can not join this cluster; the repository manager process keeps dying and messages in SYSTEM.CLUSTER.COMMAND.QUEUE are queing up. What could cause this issue? 01:06:43 Aside from the stranded messages, will other messages behind them also be hung pending delivery to other queue managers? 01:07:20 Is the administration error missing on slide 21? 01:07:43 Is there an updated support pack to remove stranded messages from SYSTEM.CLUSTER.TRANSMIT.QUEUE - the one referencd is for MQ V5.3? 01:08:48 what fixpack level would be EXPOSED to the problem in IV25030? 01:09:43 Slide 21: Create a new channel to a full repository queue manager. Is this done on the queue manager with the partial repository? 01:10:12 When adding Partial Repositories to a cluster, what are the considerations for which Full Repository we should aim the manual CLUSSNDR at? Is it fine to aim all Partial Repositories' manual CLUSSNDRs to one Full Repository? The partial will immediately create automatic cluster senders to both fulls anyway, so is it irrelevant which FR the partial aims its manual CLUSSNDR at? 01:11:29 I have two QM ids (with same QM) showing in full repos. Old QM id still exists even after the QM is taken out of cluster. All i need to is to reset the cluster to remove the QM id every time. How do i make the old QM ID (with the same QM) to go automatically? 01:12:35 Are there any best practices or considerations you can post with regards to DR setups? For instance, when bringing up Full Repo's in DR mode (for testing purposes). Should we rely solely on network seperation, etc.? 01:13:46 Closing remarks 01:14:51 End of Call \nPanel of Experts: Andy Emmett WebSphere MQ Distributed L3 Support Yana Johnson WebSphere MQ Distributed L2 Support Valerie Lampkin WebSphere MQ Distributed L2 Support William (Bill) Moss Websphere MQ Distributed L2 Support Miguel Rodriguez WebSphere MQ Distributed L2 Support \n\n\nPRESENTATION\n[http://www.ibm.com/i/v16/icons/weblecture.gif]WSTE-11192013-AskTheExperts-MQ_Clustering_Gotchas.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27039756&aid=2]WSTE-11192013-AskTheExperts-MQ_Clustering_Gotchas.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27039756&aid=1] \n\n\n\nGet Adobe Reader [http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html] to view PDF\n\n\nAUDIO\n[http://www.ibm.com/i/v16/icons/aud.gif]To replay the recording of this conference call, click on Download Audio [http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/websphere/techexchange/November-19-2013-Emmett-Johnson-Lampkin-Moss-Rodriguez.mp3] (audio in MP3 format).

For example by configuring an SSLPEER rule on the SVRCONN channel to match the Distinguished Name in the certificate of the WebSphere Application Server, and establishing trust in the issuer of that certificate. \n * A custom, or 3rd party supplied, WebSphere MQ Security Exit\n   A security exit can be written for MQ that performs username and password authentication against a repository, such as the local operating system on the MQ server, or an LDAP repository.\n   When using a security exit for authentication it is important that SSL/TLS transport security is still configured, to ensure passwords are not sent in plain text.\n\n\nMCA user ID (MCAUSER) configured on the Server Connection (SVRCONN) channel If an MCAUSER is configured on the SVRCONN channel that the application server is using to connect, and no security exit or mapping Channel Authentication Record is installed, then this overrides the username provided by the application server. \n\nIt is common practice for many customers to set an MCAUSER on every SVRCONN channel, and use mutual SSL/TLS authentication exclusively for authentication. \n\nDefault behaviour when no credentials are supplied in the application server \n\nIf no credentials are supplied by the application on the createConnection call, and neither of the component managed or container managed security systems described below are configured, then WebSphere Application Server provides a blank username to MQ. This causes MQ to authorise the client based on the userid that the MQ listener is running under. In the majority of cases this is 'mqm' on UNIX/Linux systems and 'MUSR_MQADMIN' on Windows. \n\nAs these are administrative MQ users, they will be blocked by default in WebSphere MQ V7.1 and higher, with a AMQ9777 error logged in the error logs of the queue manager. \n\nContainer-managed security for outbound connections \n\nThe recommended way to configure the username and password passed to MQ by the application server for outbound connections, is to use container-managed security. Outbound connections are those created using a Connection Factory, rather than a Listener Port or Activation Specification. \n\nUsernames of 12 characters or less are passed to MQ by the appliaction server. Usernames longer than 12 characters in length will be truncated, either during authorisation (on UNIX), or in the MQMD of messages that are sent. \n\nContainer-managed security means that the deployment descriptor, or EJB 3.0 annotations, of the application declare a resource reference with authentication type set to Container. \n\nThen when the application looks up the Connection Factory in JNDI, it does so indirectly via the resource reference. For example an EJB 2.1 application would perform a JNDI lookup as follows, where \"jms/MyResourceRef\" has been declared as a resource reference in the deployment descriptor: \n\nConnectionFactory myCF = (ConnectionFactory)ctx.lookup(\"java:comp/env/jms/MyResourceRef\") \n\nAn EJB 3.0 application might declare an annotated object property on the bean as follows:\n@Resource(name = \"jms/MyResourceRef\", \nauthenticationType = AuthenticationType.CONTAINER)\nprivate javax.jms.ConnectionFactory myCF; \n\nWhen the application is deployed by an administrator, they bind this authentication alias to an actual Connection Factory that has been created in JNDI, and assign it a J2C authentication alias on deployment. \n\nIt is the username and password contained in this authentication alias that is then passed to MQ/JMS by the application server when the application connects. This approach puts the administrator in control of which username and password is used by each application, and prevents a different application from looking up the connection factory in JNDI directly to connect with the same username and password. \n\nA default container-managed authentication alias can be supplied on the configuration panels in the administrative console for MQ connection factories. This default will only be used in the case that an application uses a resource reference configured for container-managed security, but the administrator has not bound it to an authentication alias during deployment. A screen shot is provided below:\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21636093&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21636093&aid=1] \n\nDefault component-managed authentication alias for outbound connections \n\nFor cases where it is impractical to change the application to use container-managed security, or to change it to supply a username and password directly on the createConnection call, it is possible to supply a default. \n\nThis default is called the \"component-managed authentication alias\" and cannot be configured via the administrative console (since WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0 when it was removed from the panels MQ connection factories). The below scripting samples show how to configure it using wsadmin: \n\n * JACL:\n   wsadmin>set cell [ $AdminConfig getid \"/Cell:mycell\" ]\n   \n   mycell(cells/mycell|cell.xml#Cell_1)\n   \n   wsadmin>$AdminTask listWMQConnectionFactories $cell\n   \n   MyCF(cells/mycell|resources.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104)\n   \n   wsadmin>$AdminTask modifyWMQConnectionFactory MyCF(cells/mycell|resources.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104) { -componentAuthAlias myalias }\n   \n   MyCF(cells/mycell|resources.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104) \n * Jython:\n   wsadmin>cell = AdminConfig.getid(\"/Cell:mycell\")\n   \n   wsadmin>AdminTask.listWMQConnectionFactories(cell)\n   \n   'MyCF(cells/mycell|resources.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104)'\n   \n   wsadmin>AdminTask.modifyWMQConnectionFactory('MyCF(cells/mycell|resos urces.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104)', \"-componentAuthAlias myalias\")\n   \n   'MyCF(cells/mycell|resources.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104)'\n\n\nAuthentication alias for inbound MDB connections using an activation specification For inbound connections using an activation specification an authentication alias can be specified by the administrator when deploying the application, or a default authentication alias can be specified on the activation specification via the administrative console. \n\nAuthentication alias for inbound MDB connections using a listener port \n\nFor inbound connections using a listener port, the value specified in the \"Container-managed authentication alias\" setting of the connection factory (seen in the above screenshot) is used. \n\nOn zOS, first the \"Container-managed authentication alias\" is checked and used if set, then the \"Component-managed authentication alias\" is checked and used it set.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe simplest steps to resolve the 2035 MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED errors in a development environment, where full transport security is not required, are as follows: \n\n 1. Choose a user that you want WebSphere Application Server to be authenticated as. Typically the user chosen should have authority relevant to the context of the operations required by the application running in WebSphere Application Server and no more. For example, 'mqm' or other super user is not appropriate. \n 2. If this user is an MQ administrative user, then relax the Channel Authentication Record (CHLAUTH) security in MQ V7.1 or higher, so that administrative connections are not blocked on the SVRCONN channel you wish to use. An example MQSC command to do this for a SVRCONN channel called 'WAS.CLIENTS' is provided as follows:\n    SET CHLAUTH('WAS.CLIENTS') TYPE(BLOCKUSER) USERLIST(ALLOWANY) \n 3. Configure the SVRCONN channel to set the MCA user ID (MCAUSER) to the user you have chosen. An example MQSC command to configure a SVRCONN channel to use 'myuser' as the MCA user ID is provided as follows:\n    ALTER CHL('WAS.CLIENTS') CHLTYPE(SVRCONN) MCAUSER('myuser')\n\n\nThe following additional considerations are important for production environments: For all production environments where transport security is required, SSL/TLS security must be configured between the application server and MQ. \n\nIn order to configure SSL/TLS transport security, you must establish the appropriate trust between the MQ queue manager and WebSphere Application Server. The application server, who initiates the SSL/TLS handshake, must always be configured to trust the certificate provided by the MQ queue manager . If the application server is configured to send a certificate to the MQ queue manager, then the queue manager must also be configured to trust it. \n\nIf trust is not correctly configured on both sides, you will encounter 2393 MQRC_SSL_INITIALIZATION_ERROR reason codes after enabling SSL/TLS on the connection. \n\nIf you do not have a security exit that performs username and password authentication, then you should configure mutual SSL/TLS authentication on your Server Connection channel to cause the queue manager to require a trusted certificate is provided by the application server. To do this you set \"SSL Authentication\" to \"Required\" in the MQ Explorer or SSLCAUTH(REQUIRED) via MQSC. \n\nIf you do have a security exit that performs username and password authentication installed in your MQ server, then configure your application to supply a username and password for validation by that security exit. The details of how to configure the username and password passed to MQ by the application server are described above in the \"Diagnosing the problem\" section. \n\nAll Server Connection channels that do not have SSL/TLS security applied should be disabled. Example MQSC commands to disable the SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN channel are provided as follows (these assume no user exists on the MQ server called 'NOAUTH'):\nALTER CHL(SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN) CHLTYPE(SVRCONN) MCAUSER('NOAUTH')\nSTOP CHL(SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN) \n\nDetails of how to configure the private certificate and trust of a MQ queue manager, and to enable SSL security on a Server Connection channel, see the following locations in the MQ information center: \n\n * To configure the certificates and trust of the MQ queue manager see the following topic:\n   Configuring SSL on queue managers [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.mq.explorer.doc%2Fe_ssl_channels.htm] \n * To configure the Server Connection channel, used by applications running in the application server to connect to MQ, see the following topic:\n   Configuring SSL channels [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.mq.explorer.doc/e_ssl_channels.htm]\n\n\nDetails of how you configure trust within WebSphere Application Server, and whether the application server sends a certificate to MQ for authentication, are in the following locations in the WebSphere Application Server information center:  * To create or modify an SSL Configuration containing the appropriate SSL/TLS configuration for connecting to MQ, see the following t", "document_id": "swg21636093"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Is the Requisite Pro (ReqPro) feature/plugin supported with a 64-bit install of RAD/RSA(4WS) 851?

This produces the aforementioned warning messages every 30 seconds in the profile_root/logs/server_name/systemout.log.\n\nThe root ID used to start Websphere Application Server can not find the Java system pref file. \n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nFor non-root, you can confirm this issue by trying to start WebSphere using the \"root\" ID. Review the Websphere_Home/profiles/<profile_name>/logs/<failing server_name/systemout.log to verify that you no longer see the warning messages. \n\n\nFor root, verify if the /etc/.java/.systemPrefs exists\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nFor non-root : \n\nCreate a User_Home directory for this non-root user and restart WebSphere Application Server. If this does not resolve the issue use the following 2 suggestions below : \n\nNOTE : The \"dot\" in front of the directories below represent that these are \"hidden\" directories. So the \"dot\" must be in front of the directory name to go into the directory or to access them. \n\n1. Try giving 755 permission for /home/wasadmin/.java/.userPrefs \n\n2. Add \"-Djava.util.prefs.userRoot=/home/wasadmin/preps\" as a SDK generic jvm argument \n\n\nTo set the argument on the SDK: \n\n 1. In the administrative console, click Servers > Server Types > WebSphere application servers , and select the server that you want to add the generic argument to.. \n 2. Then, in the Server Infrastructure section, click Java and process management > Process definition > Java virtual machine. \n 3. Specify -Djava.util.prefs.userRoot=/home/wasadmin/preps for the Generic JVM Arguments property, and click OK . \n 4. Click Save to save your changes. \n 5. Restart the application server.\n\n\nFor root :  1. Create a Java system pref directory\n    sudo mkdir -p /etc/.java/.systemPrefs \n 2.

"context": "de as a 64bit platform and the agents are 32bit and so it does not show the expected list of agents.\n\n\nCAUSE\nThe causes for the three scenarios depends on wrong prerequisite levels packaged into ITM for VE 7.2.0.3 for NMA agent, and on unexpected architecture recognized by the installer when trying to install the agent on the target node, if this one is a Linux x86-64.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe issues should be corrected at Installer level, APAR IV84919 has been opened to fix them. \n\nAnyway, since the correction involves the installation component, it will not be available until next release, when the Installation package will be built again. \n\nUntil then, you can bypass the issue with some manual steps. \n\n--------------- \n\n1) If the import of agent bundle using command tacmd addbundles fails with message: \n\nUnable to find bundle prerequisite: ci 06.22.04.000 li6263\n\nthis occurs because some agents, particularly N4 agent, have old prerequisites for shared components (ax, ui, gs,jr) that are not part of the ITM_for_VE bundle. \n\nThere is actually a workaround to correctly import the bundle in the depot, but it will not be of any help because remote installation of N4 agent will then fail due to the problem described in item number 2. \n\nIt can be anyway useful to know the workaround as it can be applied to other agents for which remote installation instead correctly works.\n\nYou must verify if the prerequisites mentioned in the error message are already present in your depot by using command tacmd viewdepot.\nBeside of the one mentioned in the error message, you must be sure that also the other wanted prerequisites are already present in the depot.\n\nN4 agent has the following prerequisites:\n\nProduct Code : n4 \nDeployable : True \nVersion : 062200000 \nDescription : Monitoring Agent for Network Devices \nHost Type : li6263 \nHost Version : li6263,lx8266 \nPrerequisites: ci:062204000 la:ipaddr05400 gs:074027000 jr:051201000 \nui:062204000 ax:062204000\n\nIf all of them are already in the depot, then you can run the tamcd addbundles using flag \"-n\" (ignore prerequisites), this will allow to correctly import the agent bundle.\n\nIf you do not have the wanted prerequisite levels, you have two possible options:\n\na) retrieve and add them into depot from other ITM installation packages\nb) modify the agent dsc files and change the level of the components required by the agent to match the level delivered with the bundle.\n\nFor example, ITM for Virtual Environment 7.2.0.3 delivers CI component at level 06.30.05.000, so if we consider N4 agent, you may need to change the file n4li6263.dsc in the rows:\n\n<PrereqProdCode>ci</PrereqProdCode>\n\n<PrereqVersion>\n\n<Version>06</Version>\n\n<Release>22</Release>\n\n<Mod>04</Mod>\n\n<Level>000</Level>\n\n\nto \n\n\n<PrereqProdCode>ci</PrereqProdCode>\n\n<PrereqVersion>\n\n<Version>06</Version>\n\n<Release>30</Release>\n\n<Mod>05</Mod>\n\n<Level>000</Level> \n\n \n\nThe same for other components in case they are also missing from your depot. \n\nThe dsc files are into <installation_media>/ITMfVE_Agents/unix folder. \n\nRepeat the tacmd addbundles command and it should now work fine. \n\nAs previously said, please consider that this scenario may occur also for agents different than N4, and the workaround is applicable also for them. \n\nOf course the target dsc file name changes accordingly to the agent type and related architecture. \n\n \n\n2) The above workaround can help in case the issue is only related to backleveled prerequisite packages. \n\nAnyway, once you applied it, if the target node for the N4 agent is a Linux x86-64, you will anyway not be able to install it remotely.\nThe remote deploy of N4 agent on a Linux X86_64 fails because the installer recognizes the target node as a 64bit while the agent comes with a different architecture (li6263). \nThe quickest workaround in this case is to install the agent locally.\n\n3) If you try to install the ITM for VE agents locally on a Linux x86_64, the usual installation procedure does not work for the same reason of point 2. \nThe installer recognizes the target node as a 64bit platform and the agents are 32bit. \nSo the installer menu will show no available agents to be installed.\n\nYou need to proceed as follow:\n\na) Run the local installation of N4 agent on target machine and proceed as usual when you are prompted with Installer initial questions.\nb) Select Other operating systems when you are showed this panel\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21983839&aid=1]

Unix Error Code 24. \n * Truncated Core Dumps / Heap Dumps\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n \n\nIs it possible to display the current ulimit settings? The command ulimit -Xa will display all current settings that are set for the current login session, where X represents the hard (H) or soft (S) limits to be displayed. By default, if no value is supplied for X, soft limits will be displayed. However if a process is already running, it may have a different ulimit configurations than the current shell that you run the ulimit -a command in.\n\n\n\n\nHow are ulimts set? Soft vs. Hard limits Soft limits are the current setting for a particular limit. They can be increased only to the current hard limit setting. \n\nHard limits are the maximum limit that can be configured. Any changes to these require root access. \n\n \n\nTemporary Settings (for current session) \n\n * \n * ulimit -[H|S]limit_name limit_value\n\n\nTemporary settings are set via the command line using the ulimit command. The limit_name must be present in the command (see the chart below). These settings are only temporary for the current session and will be lost once the session is over or the terminal window is closed. \n\nThis syntax can be used within shell scripts. Any processes spawned from these shell scripts will also have the temporary settings for the lifetime they are running. \n\nBy default, the soft limit will be changed (as changing the hard limit needs root access). Use -H (for hard limits) or -S (for soft limits) to change specific hard or soft limits. \n\nNOTES: \n\nOn HP-UX, if you receive an error when setting a particular limit, and you have altered that particular hard limit, you may need to check and see if it had exceeded the kernel parameters. You can use kctune to check (and alter) these if necessary; check your HP-UX documentation for more information. \n\nFor Solaris, settings in the \"/etc/system\" configuration file also allow configuring of some kernel-wide limits. \n\n \n\nGlobal Settings \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21469413&amp;aid=1] Any changes to these global configuration limits files should be performed by your system administrator. Instructions on how to edit the files can be found on the manpage or in the commented section of the configuration file, as they can vary between versions of UNIX or Linux. \n\n \n\nThe format of the file, which differs slightly on versions of AIX and Linux, allows individual limits per users or groups, as well as set hard and soft limits. The limits defined in this configuration file are set globally. \n\n \n\nChanges made to any limits file take effect after launching a new login shell (such as bash -l), or if the user logs out and logs back in to the system. \n\n \n\nNOTES: \n\nOn Solaris and HP-UX, changes made to your shell's profile configuration (.profile or .login) should also take effect on the next login shell launched, or when your user logs back in using the specific shell. \n\nFor kernel-wide settings, which usually require a restart of the operating system to take effect, HP-UX has the kctune command, while Solaris has the /etc/system configuration file. \n\n \n\nSpecifics for each Operating System:\nThe most up-to-date information on the limits can be found in the man page for \"ulimit\".\n\n\n\nAIX \nGlobal settings are generally set in the file /etc/security/limits, although there may be different limit files for LPARs and WPARs. \n\n \n\nPlease note that this table may not represent all ulimit items as they can vary between operating system versions. Consult the ulimit man page or the limits file for further information.\n\n\n\nCommand Line limit_name * /etc/security/limits Description ulimit -c [value] core\ncore_hard Core file size in 512 byte blocks. ulimit -d [value]\n(K bytes) data\ndata_hard Data segment size of processes in kilobytes. ulimit -f [value] fsize\nfsize_hard File size limit in 512 byes blocks. ulimit -n [value] nofiles\nnofiles_hard Max number of open files and/or sockets per process. ulimit -m [value]\n(K bytes) rss\nrss_hard The memory size of the process in kilobytes. ulimit -r [value] threads\nthreads_hard Max number of threads per process. ulimit -s [value]\n(K bytes) stack\nstack_hard The stack segment size in kilobytes. ulimit -t [value]\n(seconds) cpu\ncpu_hard Max per process CPU time (in seconds). ulimit -u [value] nproc\nnproc_hard Specifies the limit of the number of processes per user. * Values are in 512 byte blocks unless otherwise specified, check your man page for further information \n\n\nHP-UX \n\nThere is no global settings file on HP-UX.

The problem persists even after checking the correct license file is in the right location. \n\nSYMPTOM\nRunning the configuration command \"PDJrteCfg -action config\": \n\nExample 1. ( TDI 7.1.1 ):\n/opt/IBM/TDI/V7.1.1/jvm/jre/bin/java\n-Dpd.home=/opt/isam8/pdjrte -classpath \n/opt/isam8/pdjrte/java/export/pdjrte/PD.jar com.tivoli.pd.jcfg.PDJrteCfg\n-action config -java_home /opt/IBM/TDI/V7.1.1/jvm/jre -host <Policy Server host name> \n-port 7135 -config_type full\n\nExample 2. ( WAS 8.5.5 ):\nexport PATH=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/jre/bin:$PATH\nexport JAVA_HOME=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java\njava -Dpd.home=/opt/PolicyDirector/ -cp /opt/PolicyDirector/java/export/pdjrte/PD.jar com.tivoli.pd.jcfg.PDJrteCfg -action config -java_home /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/jre -host <Policy Server host name> -port 7135 -domain Default -config_type full -cfgfiles_path /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/tivoli/tam -alt_config\n\n\n\nBoth examples fail with the output:\nSecurity Access Manager License fileset not correct.\n\n\nCAUSE\nThe version of the PD.jar does not match the license file.\n\n\n\nENVIRONMENT\nThe issue was reported in following environment: \n\nSolaris 10\nTDI 7.1.1\npdjrte-8.0.1-3.zip\n\nThe problem was recreated by support using components and versions mentioned below:\n\nRHEL 6.0\nWAS 8.5.5\nPDJrte-PD-7.0.0-0.x86_64.rpm\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nNotice! This document assumes that all prequisites of an operating system and the Java runtime environment are correctly implemented and are at the correct level in relation to the ISAM Runtime for Java version. \n\n \n\n1) Verify the license file. \n\nExample command:\ncat /opt/PolicyDirector/.configure/PDlic.txt\n\n\nExample output:\nAccess Manager License fileset version 7.0.0.0\n\n\n2) Verify the version of the PD.jar used in the configuration command. \n\nExample command:\nunzip -p /opt/PolicyDirector/java/export/pdjrte/PD.jar META-INF/MANIFEST.MF |grep \"Implementation-Version\" \n\nExample output:\nImplementation-Version: 7.0.0.0\n\n\n3) Verify from which location the PD.jar is loaded. \n\nUse Java command option -verbose:class with the \"PDJrteCfg -action config\" command. \n\nExample command:\n/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/jre/bin/java -verbose:class-Dpd.home=/opt/PolicyDirector/ -cp /opt/PolicyDirector/java/export/pdjrte/PD.jar com.tivoli.pd.jcfg.PDJrteCfg -action config -java_home /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/jre -host <Policy Server host name> -port 7135 -domain Default -config_type full -cfgfiles_path /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/tivoli/tam -alt_config\n\n\nExample output ( exerpt of the output ):\n...\nclass load: com.tivoli.pd.jcfg.IPDJrteCfg from: file:/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/jre/lib/ext/PD.jar\nclass load: com.tivoli.pd.jutil.IPDPathConstants from: file:/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/jre/lib/ext/PD.jar\nclass load: com.tivoli.pd.jcfg.IPDJrteCfgConstants from: file:/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/jre/lib/ext/PD.jar\nclass load: com.tivoli.pd.jcfg.PDJrteCfg from: file:/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/jre/lib/ext/PD.jar\nclass load: com.tivoli.pd.jutil.PDPrintStream from: file:/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/jre/lib/ext/PD.jar\n...\n\n\n4) Compare the location of the PD.jar defined versus what has been used. \n\nThe Java command option -cp defines the classpath used with the \"PDJrteCfg -action config\" command: \n\n-cp /opt/PolicyDirector/java/export/pdjrte/PD.jar. \n\nAs per the output above classes are loaded from different location than what was defined by the classpath option: \n\n/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/jre/lib/ext/PD.jar \n\n \n\n5) Check the PD.jar version that was used while running the \"PDJrteCfg -action config\" command. \n\nExample:\nunzip -p /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/jre/lib/ext/PD.jar META-INF/MANIFEST.MF |grep \"Implementation-Version\" \n\nOutput:\nImplementation-Version: 6.1.0.7\n\n\nA mismatch between the PD.jar file ( 6.1.0.7 ) and the license file ( 7.0.0.0 ) versions is causing the \"Access Manager License Fileset not correct\" error message.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nIn this case it is important to understand in which order class files are loaded by the class loaders when a java application is executed. The Java classes are loaded in the following order: \n\n1. Bootstrap class loader ( $JAVAHOME/jre/lib/rt.jar ) \n\n2. Extension class loader ( $JAVAHOME/jre/lib/ext/*.jar ) \n\n3. System class loader ( $CLASSPATH ) \n\n \n\nIn effect, these three search paths are joined to form a simple class path. In the example of \"PDJrteCfg -action config\" command above the Java command line option -cp was given. Intention was to override the \"full classpath\" and use the correct version of the PD.jar file. Based on the Java rules -cp option does override the CLASSPATH environment variable but -cp option does not affect the bootstrap or extension class loaders. The classpath ( defined either by the CLASSPATH environment variable or by the -cp option ) is searched only if a class to be loaded hasn't been found by the bootstrap or extension class loaders. In the example case classes were loaded by the extension class loader and therefore an old version of the PD.jar file was used.

When you log on to additional namespaces, if your trusted credentials associated with the primary account contain logon information for that namespace, then those trusted credentials are updated. NOTE: Do not use the All namespaces option if users authenticate into secondary namespaces as different users.\n\n\nA user's trusted credentials for a namespace will only be renewed once per day. \n\nIt is NOT possible to use SSO with the feature 'Automatically Renew Trusted Credentials' found in Cognos BI. The reason for this is due to the following: \n\n\"A trusted credential is special because the namespace credentials it stores must be usable at any time, not depending on any timestamp. This rules out SSO tickets like Kerberos tokens or SAP tokens as they will expire after a short time and will become unusable. A suitable trusted credential therefore usually is a pair consisting of a user name and a password. However, for SSO based authentication to IBM Cognos BI, there is no password available to the namespace that can be stored into the trusted credential. Therefore, this feature will only work for basic authentication, when the user provides a user name and password to the login screen.\" RELATED INFORMATION\n Proven Practices: Securing the IBM Cognos 10 BI Environ [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/data/library/cognos/security/cognos_bi_platform/page602.html]\nCognos Analytics 11 Equivalent Technote [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21998776]", "document_id": "swg21591076"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "ITNM 4.2 FP3 is available, if yes then where we can download?.

To avoid this problem, the generic JVM argument [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365] -Xgc:preferredHeapBase=<address> [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/understanding/mm_compressed_references.html] can be used to ensure the Java heap is allocated above the 4GB address space. This will leave more room for the Class Pointer and Monitor/Lock memory. \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * This will locate the Java heap starting at the 4GB mark thus leaving the lower 4GB for the other processes.\n\n\nIncrease Maximum Heap Size to Force Heap Allocation Above the 4GB mark \n\nAnother way to ensure that the heap is allocated above the 4GB mark (Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0 and later) is to set a maximum heap size equal to or greater than 4GB. For example -Xmx4G will ensure that the heap will have to be allocated above the 4GB mark. This will not work in earlier versions of the JVM since these earlier versions allowed the heap to straddle the 4GB mark, placing part of the memory above and some below (fixed as part of APAR IV37797) . \n\n \n\nFurther Investigation \n\nIf after setting -Xgc:preferredHeapBase=<address> or -Xmx4G a NOOM is still encountered (Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0 and later), then further investigation is required at the application level. Look to decrease the size and usage of the applications Class Pointers and Monitors/Locks. Additionally, there are some WebSphere Application Server troubleshooting methods that may help reduce the native memory footprint. See: IBM Troubleshooting native memory issues [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21373312].\n\nReserving Low-Memory Space with -Xmcrs\n\nIf there is still free memory in the system when a Native OutOfMemory (NOOM) occurs, then the problem may be a shortage of memory in the low-memory region (under 4GB). Even if the Java heap is located above this boundary, other data associated with Java objects can be located in the low-memory region.\n\nThe OS memory allocator will deal out low-memory freely, thus memory resources in the lower boundary may run out. Later when the JVM tries to allocate memory for an artifact which is required to be allocated in low-memory (because the JVM has only reserved a 32bit pointer for it) it fails and throws an OutOfMemoryError.\n\nStarting in Java 6.0.16.3, Java 6.1.8.3, Java 7.0.8.10, Java 7.1.2.10, there is a parameter -Xmcrs [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_6.0.0/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/appendixes/cmdline/xmcrs.html] which allows the JVM to increase the amount of low memory it reserves on startup. With this setting, as long as the low-memory usage by the JVM does not exceed the -Xmcrs value, NOOM in the lower boundary will be avoided.\n\nTo set this parameter, first decide what a reasonable value for your lower memory requirements may be. Reasonable value is unique to each environment so there is not a general recommendation.\n\n\n * -Xmcrs<reasonable_value_for_lower_memory>\n\n * \n * NATIVEMEMINFO subcomponent dump routine\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=2]\n * \n\n\nDisabling Compressed References with -Xnocompressedrefs As a last resort, if the native memory still can not be contained under the 4GB mark, you can set -Xnocompressedrefs [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/appendixes/cmdline/Xnocompressedrefs.html] as a generic JVM argument. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365] Using -Xnocompressedrefs will remove the use of compressed references and therefore remove the lower 4GB memory restriction on the Class Pointers and Monitors/Locks. This will however, result in a significant increase in Java heap memory requirements. It is not uncommon for 70% more heap space to be required. Due to the increased memory requirements it is strongly advised that the Java heap size is adjusted to a larger value and garbage collection is monitored and retuned as required.\n\nAdditionally, some benchmarks show a 10-20% relative throughput decrease when disabling compressed references: \"Analysis shows that a 64-bit application without CR yields only 80-85% of 32-bit throughput but with CR yields 90-95%. Depending on application requirements, CR can improve performance up to 20% over standard 64-bit.\" See:ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf].\n\nBefore using -Xnocompressedrefs as a solution, first rule out the possibility of a native memory leak. Since using -Xnocompressedrefs will allow the the native memory to grow unbounded, a leak in native memory will lead to process size growth eventually leading to a process that needs to be paged out. The paging will incur performance overhead which will eventually lead to an unstable environment. Therefore careful consideration must be used when selecting -Xnocompressedrefs as a solution.\n\n\nMemory Map Considerations \n\nThe below figure is a generalization of how the JVM handles addresses in each section of the memory map based on heap size and compressed references (CR). Please note that at each stage beyond having all of the Java memory contained below the 4GB mark, there will be performance consequences: \n\n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp", "document_id": "swg21660890"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Is it recommended to use symbolic links when installing Omnibus 8.1 fixpacks?", "id": "TRAIN_Q040", "answers": [{"answer_id": 48231908, "document_id": "swg21628092", "question_id": "TRAIN_Q040", "text": "You install IBM Installation Manager by using symbolic links at the root level for the agent data location or the installation location or for both locations and after a system change or system restart you cannot start Installation Manager or you cannot use Installation Manager to update or uninstall products.", "answer_start": 134, "answer_end": 445, "answer_category": null}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "RN1.6.3; RN1.6.3.1; RN1.7; RN1.7.1; RN1.7.2; SRX; 1628092; RATLC02668456; IPL; Symlink TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n You install IBM Installation Manager by using symbolic links at the root level for the agent data location or the installation location or for both locations and after a system change or system restart you cannot start Installation Manager or you cannot use Installation Manager to update or uninstall products. \n\nCAUSE\nWhen you install Installation Manager, the values for the agent data directory, the Installation Manager binaries, and the installation directories for products are stored internally as absolute paths with all the symbolic links resolved. If a symbolic link is used as part of the path for any of these directories or binaries, the symbolic link is replaced with its target value.\nSimilarly, when a product is installed with Installation Manager, the values for the installation location and shared resources directory are stored internally as absolute paths with all symbolic links resolved. \n\nIf the symbolic links change their values, the absolute path names for directories that are used by Installation Manager might change. When the Installation Manager starts, it will initialize itself using the data in the agent data location. However, the stored values for the paths to the agent data directory, Installation Manager binaries, or product installation locations do not point to the new locations. Installation Manager might fail to start, or might be unable to update or uninstall products that are installed.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nWhen choosing locations for the agent data directory, the Installation Manager binaries, shared resources directory, and the installation directories for products, do not use paths that include symbolic links. \n\n\nIf Installation Manager is using paths that no longer exist, create the old paths manually and mount the affected file systems at the original locations that are used by Installation Manager.

For example, data typically stored in /opt/IBM/ITM/config and /opt/IBM/ITM/logs can be redirected to /var/IBM/ITM/config and /var/IBM/ITM/logs. This new file system location is designated by the user at installation time, and it is referred to as CANDLEDATA. A conversion utility is provided to implement CANDLEDATA for existing installations. \n\nThe CANDLEDATA mechanism is available with ITM 6.30.05.00. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow CANDLEDATA Works \n\nThe CANDLEDATA mechanism is implemented primarily using symbolic links. This means most of the underlying code in ITM is unaware of CANDLEDATA. This also means the CANDLEDATA mechanism is limited to Linux and UNIX platforms. \n\nThe rest of this section shows examples of links where CANDLEHOME=/opt/IBM/ITM and CANDLEDATA=/var/IBM/ITM. You can define different locations for your own installation. \n\n \n\nBase Directory Links \n\nThe following local data directories are always linked from CANDLEHOME to CANDLEDATA:\n\n\n * /opt/IBM/ITM/InstallITM -> /var/IBM/ITM/InstallITM\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/config -> /var/IBM/ITM/config\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/kt1v3depot -> /var/IBM/ITM/kt1v3depot\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/localconfig -> /var/IBM/ITM/localconfig\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/logs -> /var/IBM/ITM/logs\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/patchlogs -> /var/IBM/ITM/patchlogs\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/tables -> /var/IBM/ITM/tables\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/tmaitm6/agentdepot -> /var/IBM/ITM/tmaitm6/agentdepot\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/tmp -> /var/IBM/ITM/tmp\n\nThese directories and links are automatically generated by ITM when the system is installed or converted to use CANDLEDATA. \n\n \n\nGeneral Agent Directory Links \n\nIn addition to the base set of directory links, most agents have general links for TEMA data:\n\n\n * /opt/IBM/ITM/ATTRLIB -> /var/IBM/ITM/ATTRLIB\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/<platform>/<pc>/tables/ATTRLIB -> /var/IBM/ITM/ATTRLIB/<pc>\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/EIFLIB -> /var/IBM/ITM/EIFLIB\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/<platform>/<pc>/tables/EIFLIB -> /var/IBM/ITM/EIFLIB/<pc>\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/hist -> /var/IBM/ITM/hist\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/<platform>/<pc>/hist -> /var/IBM/ITM/hist/<pc>\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/psit -> /var/IBM/ITM/psit\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/<platform>/<pc>/psit -> /var/IBM/ITM/psit/<pc>\n\n\nThese directories and links are automatically generated by ITM when the agent is converted to use CANDLEDATA.  \n\nSpecial Agent Directory Links \n\nSome agents have links that are specific to that agent. For example, the LZ and UX agents create the following link for the Watchdog component to store local data:\n\n\n * /opt/IBM/ITM/kca -> /var/IBM/ITM/kca\n\n\nThese directories and links are automatically generated by ITM when the agent is converted to use CANDLEDATA.  \n\nCANDLEDATA <-> CANDLEHOME Directory Links \n\nThe CANDLEHOME and CANDLEDATA directories also have cross references to each other:\n\n\n * /opt/IBM/IBM/registry/CANDLEDATA -> /var/IBM/ITM\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM <- /var/IBM/ITM/CANDLEHOME\n\n\nThese links are all automatically generated by ITM when the system is installed or converted to use CANDLEDATA.  \n\nConfiguration Variables exploited by CANDLEDATA \n\nIn addition to symbolic links, some individual components have special configuration settings to redirect agent-specific data to CANDLEDATA. ITM redirects data using the following configuration variables:\n\n\n * CTIRA_SIT_PATH\n * \n * CANDLEHOME/\n * <platform>/<pc>/psit\n * \n * \n * KCA_IP_DIR\n * \n * CANDLEHOME/kca\n * \n * \n * KCAWD_WRITE_DIR \n * \n * CANDLEHOME/kca\n * \n * \n\nNotes:  1. While the variables point to CANDLEHOME/xxx, the directory links cause the local data to be written to the corresponding CANDLEDATA/xxx. \n 2. If you use configuration overrides that set these configuration variables, you'll need to review how those overrides work in an environment configured to use CANDLEDATA. In most cases, you'll want to remove your overrides.\n\n\nConfiguration Variables affected by CANDLEDATA\nThe symbolic links established by ITM for CANDLEDATA assume standard agent configuration. If you've modified any of the following, data will be continue to be redirected to the location you specified instead of the CANDLEDATA directory:\n. \n\n * ATTRLIB\n * \n * CTIRA_HIST_DIR\n * \n * EIFLIB\n * \n * \n\nWhen converting an existing CANDLEHOME, ITM migrates any data in the original directories before linking them to CANDLEDATA. If you've modified any of the following, you must consider whether you need to change the setting and migrate the data manually: \n.  * CTIRA_SIT_FILE\n * \n * \n\nBy default, all of the following configuration variables direct data to /opt/IBM/ITM/localconfig. ITM migrates data from /opt/IBM/ITM/localconfig to /var/IBM/ITM/localconfig and then links the two. If you've modified any of these, you must consider whether you need to change the setting and migrate the data manually: \n.  * CTIRA_THRESHOLDS \n * \n * IRA_EVENT_EXPORT_SNMP_TRAP_CONFIG\n * \n * \n * IRA_LOCALCONFIG_DIR\n * \n * \n * IRA_PRIVATE_SITUATION_CONFIG\n * \n * \n * IRA_SERVICE_INTERFACE_DEFAULT_PAGE\n * \n * \n * IRA_SERVICE_INTERFACE_DIR\n * \n * \n * KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS \n\n\n\n\n\nKnown Restrictions\n\n\n 1.

You can set up the environment for both HTTP and HTTPS, however HTTP access is not supported. \n\nCAUSE\nFor security reasons, HTTP access is disabled by default and is not supported. \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nBefore you begin\n\n\nAfter installing Dashboard Application Services Hub and before beginning this procedure, log in to the console to ensure that it has connectivity and can start successfully. \n\nAbout this task \n\nConfiguring for HTTP and HTTPS console access involves editing theweb.xmlfile of Web components. Use this procedure to identify and edit the appropriate Web XML files. \n\nImportant: These steps are provided for information purposes only, as setting up the environment for HTTP access is not supported. \n\nProcedure \n\n1. Change to the following directory:JazzSM_WAS_Profile/config/cells/JazzSMNode01Cell/applications. \n\n2. From this location, locate theweb.xmlfiles in the following directories: \n\n * For the Integrated Solutions Console web application archive:isc.ear/deployments/isc/isclite.war/WEB-INF \n * For the Charts web application archive:isc.ear/deployments/isc/TIPChartPortlet.war/WEB-INF \n * For the Dashboard Application Services Hub Change Password web application archive:isc.ear/deployments/isc/TIPChangePasswd.war/WEB-INF\n\n\n3. Open one of the web.xmlfiles using a text editor. 4. Find the<transport-guarantee>element. The initial value of all<transport-guarantee>elements isCONFIDENTIAL, meaning that secure access is always required. \n\n5. Change the setting toNONEto enable both HTTP and HTTPS requests. The element now reads:<transport-guarantee>NONE</transport-guarantee>. \n\n6. Save the file, and then repeat these steps for the otherweb.xmldeployment files. \n\n7. Stop and restart the server. [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEKCU_1.1.2.1/com.ibm.psc.doc/admin/psc_ctr_admin_restart_jazzsm_servers.html] \n\nExample \n\nThe following example is a section of theweb.xmlfile forTIPChangePasswdwhere the transport-guarantee parameter is set toNONE:\n<security-constraint>\n<display-name>\nChangePasswdControllerServletConstraint</display-name>\n<web-resource-collection>\n<web-resource-name>ChangePasswdControllerServlet</web-resource-name>\n<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>\n</web-resource-collection>\n<auth-constraint>\n<description>Roles</description>\n<role-name>administrator</role-name>\n<role-name>operator</role-name>\n<role-name>configurator</role-name>\n<role-name>monitor</role-name>\n<role-name>iscadmins</role-name>\n</auth-constraint>\n<user-data-constraint>\n<transport-guarantee>NONE</transport-guarantee>\n</user-data-constraint>\n</security-constraint> \n\nWhat to do next \n\nUsers must now specify a different port, depending on the mode of access. The default port numbers are as follows:\nhttp://<host_name>:16310/ibm/console\nUse the HTTP port for logging in to the Dashboard Application Services Hub on the HTTP port .\nhttps://<host_name>:16311/ibm/console\nUse the HTTPS secure port for logging in to the Dashboard Application Services Hub. \n\nNote:If you want to use single sign-on (SSO) then you must use the fully qualified domain name of the Dashboard Application Services Hub host.", "document_id": "swg21974566"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I am planning an upgrade to the latest release of DB2 and I am looking for the main differences with the previous release.

How do I use this tool? \n\nANSWER\nWpcollector is a command line tool that automates the collection of portal logs and configuration files. Using automated log collection early in the Case life cycle can greatly reduce the number of doc requests that are made by Support. \n\nWpcollector is delivered with WebSphere Portal beginning with the 7.0 release. If tracing is required for the problem scenario, you must manually enable traceStrings and recreate the problem PRIOR to running wpcollector. \n\nTo run wpcollector, please follow the steps, below:\n\n\n\n * If IBM Support has requested tracing, enable it as instructed by the L2 Support Engineer and then recreate the problem. If no tracing is requested, proceed to the step, below: \n   \n\n\n * If using Microsoft Windows, Unix/Linux, or IBM i, run the following script from the <wp_profile_root> [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHRKX_8.5.0/mp/reference/wpsdirstr.dita]/PortalServer/bin/ directory to begin the collection:  * \n    * \n    *  Unix/Linux: wpcollector.sh \n    *  i: wpcollector.sh \n    *  \n    * Tip: To specify the option for collecting files for the Deployment Manager profile, use the \"dmgr.root\" parameter. For example: \n    *  wpcollector.bat -Ddmgr.root=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/profiles/dmgr_profile\n   \n   \n * If using IBM z/OS, proceed as follows [../reference/wpsdirstr.html%5C]:  * \n    * \n    *  In the Portal configuration panel, select Collect Diagnostics. \n    *  Follow the Customization Dialog instructions for submitting the Collect Diagnostics job (EJPSLOGS). \n    *  \n    * Tip: To collect data from the Deployment Manager, the only requirement is to submit the job from the system where the Deployment Manager is installed (i.e. so it can access the files). There is no prompt in the ISPF panel for this.\n   \n   \n * Locate the wp.mustgather-<timestamp>.zip file in the <wp_profile_root> [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHRKX_8.5.0/mp/reference/wpsdirstr.dita]/filesForAutoPD/ directory and follow the instructions in \"Exchanging information with IBM Technical Support for problem determination\" [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21153852] to manually FTP the collection to IBM. If using z/OS, there may be additional z/OS-specific files required, such as WebSphere Portal servant region or controller region joblogs. Wpcollector currently does not collect these files. Your L2 Support Engineer will inform you in the event these files are needed and provide instructions for collecting them. \n   \n\n\n * If tracing was requested and enabled, please follow the instructions provided by the L2 Support Engineer to disable tracing from the environment\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Data Collection and Symptom Analysis [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHRKX_8.5.0/mp/trouble/tbl_apdt_over.dita?lang=en]", "document_id": "swg21445430"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I need to understand details regarding an insufficient authorization check for project actions in IBM Business Process Manager (CVE-2014-4844).

An attacker able to make an application call this function could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system. \nCVSS Base Score: 5.1\nCVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101073 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/101073] for the current score\nCVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined\nCVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) \n\nCVEID: CVE-2014-8121 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8121]\nDESCRIPTION: GNU C Library (glibc) is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by the failure to properly check if a file is open by DB_LOOKUP in nss_files/files-XXX.c in the Name Service Switch (NSS). By performing a look-up on a database while iterating over it, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to enter into an infinite loop.\nCVSS Base Score: 5\nCVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/102652 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/102652] for the current score\nCVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined\nCVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) \n\nThis IBM technote has been put together to provide clarification in regards to which versions of IBM Security Access Manager/Tivoli Access Manager for e-business are vulnerable and which versions are not. \n\n\nANSWER\nIt is important to note that only IBM Security Access Manager appliances are exposed to this vulnerability. This is due to the fact that customers are unable to upgrade the underlying operating system provided with these appliances. The IBM Security Access Manager development/support teams have provided fixes to overcome this exposure on our appliances. \n\n\nThe following security bulletin provides more information about these fixes: \n\nIBM Security Access Manager for Web\n\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21968821 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21968821] \n\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21969017 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21969017]\n\nThe following software versions of IBM Security Access Manager are not vulnerable to these vulnerabilities:\n\nIBM Security Access Manager for Web version 7.0.0 (software-based)\nIBM Tivoli Access Manager for e-business version 6.1.1\nIBM Tivoli Access Manager for e-business version 6.1\nIBM Tivoli Access Manager for e-business version 6.0\n\nThis is due to the fact that these software releases do not package any part of the GNU C Library. \n\nIt is however important to note that the underlying Operating System, which hosts these software versions of IBM Security Access Manager for Web/Tivoli Access Manager for e-business, might be vulnerable.\n\nTherefore, IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify vulnerable releases of glibc including your Operating Systems and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.

Only customers who have purchased Operational Decision Manager V8.5.1 can use this fix pack.\n\n\nHow to install the fix pack\nIf you are not installing both Operational Decision Manager components, skip the instructions regarding Decision Center or Decision Server.\n\n\n 1. For Decision Center, download 8.5.1-WS-ODM_DC-<OS>-FP002.zip, and extract its files. (Change <OS> to match your platform: AIX, HPUX, LINUX, OS400, SOLARIS, ZOS, or WIN32.) \n 2. Extract the archive to a new folder, named WDC. \n 3. For Decision Server, Download 8.5.1-WS-ODM_DS-<OS>-FP002.zip, and extract its files. (Change <OS> to match your platform: AIX, HPUX, LINUX, OS400, SOLARIS, ZOS, or WIN32.) \n 4. Extract the archive to a new folder, named WDS.\n\n\nInstalling by using IBM Installation Manager:  1.  Launch IBM Installation Manager. \n 2.  In the toolbar menu, open File > Preferences and do the following: \n 3.  Select repositories. \n 4.  For Decision Center, click Add Repository. \n 5.  Browse to the extracted folder WDC\\updates. \n 6.  Select the file repository.config. \n 7.  For Decision Server, click Add Repository. \n 8.  Browse to the extracted folder WDS\\updates. \n 9.  Select the file repository.config. \n 10. Make sure the repositories are selected in the Repositories list. \n 11. Click Apply to save your changes, and click OK to close the Repositories list. \n 12. Click Update to update your installation. \n 13. Follow the instructions in the installation manager to complete the installation.\n\n\nInstalling by using the Installation Manager command line:  1. Locate the imcl command under <IM installation>/eclipse/tools. \n 2. Run the commandimcl updateAll -repositories WDC/updates,WDS/updates -acceptLicense.\n\n * Use the option -installDirectory <install path of ODM 8.5.1> to update a specific installation. \n * If you update only Decision Server or Decision Center, specify the repository accordingly.\n\n\nApplying the fix pack \nAfter you install the fix pack, you might have to do additional steps to apply the fix pack in your environment. To complete the update, see When and how to apply a modification or fix pack [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21665766]. \n\nWarning: \nIf you have installed interim fixes for Operational Decision Manager V8.5.1, you must uninstall the fixes before you can install this fix pack. You must also stop the Operational Decision Manager sample server for this installation. If you do not uninstall the fixes and stop the server, the installation of the fix pack fails. If you attempt to install the fix pack without uninstalling the interim fixes, the installer uninstalls the interim fixes before the installer fails. In this case, stop the sample server and restart the installation.

Specifying a ruleset path with no version ( such as /MyRuleApp/MyRuleset/ ) is interpreted as a request to execute the highest version of the ruleset, as opposed to a version specific ruleset path ( such as /MyRuleApp/2.0/MyRuleset/1.0 ). Validate that the executed ruleset path is indeed unexpected considering the requested ruleset path. \n\n \n\nA common situation for an unexpected ruleset version to be executed is that of a hot deployment that is not successfully completed. The more frequent causes for the hot deployment not to happen as expected are: \n\n * Permission issue: the user publishing the ruleset update must have sufficient administrative rights ( Monitor role in WebSphere Application Server ) in order for the deployment to notify all the Execution Units of the ruleset update through JMX. For example on WebSphere Application Server see Mapping the resAdministrators group to the Monitor role [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.config/config_ds_res_was8/tsk_was_map_admin_group.html] \n * Version mismatch between the Execution Unit(s) and the Management Console: in order for the Management Console to detect the presence of execution units the versions of these components must match down to the fix level. For example 7.1.1.4 Management Console would not interact properly with a 7.1.1.3 Execution Unit. The version of the RES console is displayed in the \"About\" link (top right corner). The version of the Execution Unit can be seen in the resource adapter ra.xml file where a resourceadapter-version tag shows the version. For example with the WebSphere Application Server this can seen through: Resources > Resource adapters > XU > Deployment Descriptor \n * Asynchronous ruleset parsing is used : in this mode, while an updated ruleset is being parsed, an earlier version of the ruleset can be used for executions that are requested at that time. Note that there is no guarantee of which specific earlier version of the ruleset may be used since it is a factor of which versions are available in the deprecated ruleset cache and whether garbage collection has occurred. In order to remove any uncertainty on the version that can be executed, it is possible to either turn off the asynchronous mode [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing/topics/tsk_res_config_asynchron_turnoff.html], or force synchronous parsing in asynchronous mode [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing/topics/tsk_res_config_forcing_sync_pars.html]. \n * Notification scope is limited to one cell : by design the RES notification mechanism only works within one WebSphere Application Server Cell ( or one JBoss domain, or one Weblogic domain ), so a Management Console may only notify Execution Units that are running on servers in the same cell as the RES Console. See XU notification in a cluster over multiple cells [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21458245]. If you need to implement notifications to several cells at once, the document Ruleset updates and programmatic notification of RES eXecution Unit [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21418646] can be useful. \n * Parsing failure of an updated ruleset : leading the XU to fall back on an earlier active version that parses successfully \n * Ruleset update was only written to persistence: writing directly to RES persistence with the ant tasks res-write-db or res-write-file [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing/topics/tsk_res_deploy_rlapp_ant.html] does not trigger a notification, so the update may only been seen after server restart. \n * XU MBean is not activated in Java SE mode : See Activating the XU MBean in Java SE [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing/topics/tsk_res_config_xu_mbean_jse.html] \n * Multiple Java SE Execution Units are deployed in the same JVM: See Rule Execution Server J2SE mode hot deployment does not seem to work [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21585251] \n\n \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration WebSphere ILOG JRules Modules:Execution Server (BRES / RES) Platform Independent 7.1.1, 7.1, 7.0.3, 7.0.2, 7.0.1, 7.0", "document_id": "swg21598779"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Is there a way in IBM Integration Bus (IIB) or WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) to not use cache inside a HttpRequest node?

The old PICTURE clause in DFHCOB was TMRCPUT-TIME PICTURE 9(8) COMP. The new PICTURE clause is S9(8). Looking at the SMF 110 records generated by CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V3.2 and higher, you find values like x'000000000025CFE0'. The values generated by CICS TS V2.3 and V3.1 are more in the range '00000071'. You want to know, what does the field USRCPUT represent and how to convert it to seconds? \n\nCAUSE\nThe length of USRCPUT changed starting in CICS TS V3.2. \n\nANSWER\nUSRCPUT is the total CPU time for user task including DB2 time. It is the processor time for which the user task was dispatched on each CICS TCB under which the task executed. This can include TCB modes QR, RO, CD, FO, SZ, RP, SL, SO, H8, J8, L8, S8 and D2.\n\nTo convert the OLD format (prior to CICS TS V3.2) of USRCPUT CPUTIME to milliseconds, you would: \n\n 1. Convert the 4-byte value from hex to decimal. \n 2. Multiply the result by 0.016 to obtain the value in milliseconds or by .000016 to get the value in seconds.\n\n\nNote that 16 microseconds is equivalent to 0.016 milliseconds and that its equivalent to 0.000016 seconds. A clock is a 32-bit value, expressed in units of 16 microseconds, accumulated during one or more measurement periods. The 32-bit value is followed by 8 reserved bits, that are in turn followed by a 24-bit value indicating the number of such periods. \n\nFor a specific example, if the total USRCPUT field had a value of X'000001BB000005' then the first 4 bytes would be the accumulative CPU time. So, for 5 dispatches of the task you had 1BB ticks. Converting 1BB to decimal gives you 443. You multiply that by .000016 to get .007088 total CPU seconds for the transaction. \n\nThe USRCPUT field for CICS TS V3.2 is a 12 byte field. Basically, clock fields like USRCPUT are now 12 bytes instead of 8 bytes. So, in CICS TS V2.3 the USRCPUT part of the SMF 110 record might look like 00000BC300000007 which you would break it down as follows: 00000BC300000007 Example 8 byte USRCPUT in releases of CICS prior to CICS TS V3.2 00000BC3 CPU time in binary units where the smallest unit is 16 microseconds (bytes 1 to 4) 00 Reserved bits (byte 5) 000007 Count of the number of times contributed to the CPU time (bytes 6 to 8) \nNow with CICS TS V3.2 you will see something like 000000000BC3F29D00000007 and you would break it down as follows: 000000000BC3F29D00000007 Example 12 byte USRCPUT in releases CICS TS V3.2 and higher 000000000BC3F29D CPU time in store clock (STCK) units (bytes 1 to 8) 00 Reserved bits (byte 9) 000007 Count of the number of times contributed to the CPU time (bytes 10 to 12) \nBefore you could convert the CPU time to seconds by taking 00000BC3 and converting to decimal and multiplying by .000016. But, now you would take the middle 4 bytes of the CPU time (which would give you 00000BC3) and then convert it like you used to. Or, to get a little greater accuracy you could do the following:  1. Disregard the bottom 3 nibbles of the CPU time (leaving you 000000000BC3F) and convert it to decimal. \n 2. Multiply the result by .000001 to get the value in seconds. \n    \n\n\nFor example, if using a value of 0000000000E6B140 for CPU time you would drop off the 140 which gives you 0000000000E6B. Then convert it to a decimal of 3691, and multiply 3691 by .000001 to get 0.003691 seconds. \n\nIf you take a look in DFH$MOLS which is found in SDFHSAMP, you can see how it does the conversion. When in the source, do a find on label FLDCLPRT. There you can see that with CICS TS V3.2 data, it will pass all 8 bytes of the time component to IPPARMS and pass that to the STCKCONV macro. But for data from releases of CICS before V3.2, the code will clear the 8-bytes in IPPARMS and then copy the 4 byte time component to the middle 4 bytes of that, and then pass that to STCKCONV. \n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n CICS/TS CICS TS CICS Transaction Server", "document_id": "swg21366634"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "We are running WAS 6.1.

If so, what are the different scenarios for the JVM restart requirement for any WAR or EAR file deployment? 38:14 I have exported an EAR file from one WAS V6.1 admin console and tried to deploy the exported EAR file into another WAS V6.1 admin console (different WAS profile with the same WAS version). All of a sudden, in the destination WAS V6.1 admin console all of the installed applications have disappeared from the $WAS_INSTALL_HOME/ profiles/AppSrv02/installedApps/ directory. How can I avoid this kind of situation in the future? 41:00 Can we have multiple application deployments for different applications deployed on different JVMs at the same time using roll out update? 43:09 Regarding the property based configuration question (7). Is the simple output format an option in the extract command? What version of WAS supports it? 44:24 With an application deployed in a cluster, is it possible to use wsadmin to stop only in one node of the cluster when the plugin does not know that the application is stopped on that node? Also is it possible to configure the plugin to be detected when the application is stopped? 47:24 If I have one application that is deployed in a cluster with two nodes. We can send all the transactions through one particular JVM without stopping the JVM or the server? 49:20 Does IBM have or provide any sample scripts to automate application deployments in a distributed environment? 50:54 Can we customize the error page for an application when the application is in a stopped state? 52:05 Closing remarks 53:53 End of Call \nPanel of Experts: Kumaran Ayyakutti WebSphere Application Server L2 support Preston Law WebSphere Application Server L2 support Sangwon Oh WebSphere Application Server L2 support Vikram Thommandru WebSphere Application Server L2 support \n\nPRESENTATION\n[http://www.ibm.com/i/v16/icons/weblecture.gif]WSTE-03132012-AskTheExperts-ApplicationManagementWebSphereApplicationServer-Thommandru.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27024145&aid=2]WSTE-03132012-AskTheExperts-ApplicationManagementWebSphereApplicationServer-Thommandru.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27024145&aid=1]\n\nGet Adobe Reader [http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html] to view PDF\n\nAUDIO\n[http://www.ibm.com/i/v16/icons/aud.gif]To replay the recording of this 53 minutes conference call, click on Download Audio [http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/websphere/techexchange/Mar-13-2012-Thommandru.mp3] (6.0MB - audio in MP3 format).

We are running Oracle Database 12c Enterprise Edition Release 12.1.0.2.0 - 64bit Production. The JDBC driver is ojdbc6.jar - Oracle 11.1.0.7.0-Production JDBC 4.0 compiled with JDK6.\n\nThere is another older driver ojdbc14.jar\n\nWhen I do a test connection, I can see the JDBC Driver version is 9.2.0.1.0, but in the JDBC providers I have specified ojdbc6.jar. so it should show 11.1.0.7.0 but it is showing 9.2.0.1.0. why it is showing 9.2.0.1.0?\n\nIf we keep only ojdbc6.jar and do a test connection it is giving the correct JDBC Drivers version as it is same with ojdbc6.jar. But when we keep both ojdbc6.jar and ojdbc14.jar it is not giving the correct JDBC Driver version looks it is giving ojdbc14.jar version.\n\nJDBC providers are pointed to ojdbc6.jar, but why it is showing a different JDBC driver version?", "id": "TRAIN_Q083", "answers": [{"answer_id": 40396502, "document_id": "swg21634612", "question_id": "TRAIN_Q083", "text": "When multiple versions of the JDBC driver are configured in WebSphere Application Server, irrespective of the scopes, there is a possibility of a collision of the classes and we cannot predict from which version of the driver jar the class got loaded.", "answer_start": 902, "answer_end": 1153, "answer_category": null}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "in websphere JDBC provider. \n\nIn Cell Scope - C:\\jdbc\\ojdbc5\\ojdbc5.jar \n\nIn Node Scope - C:\\jdbc\\ojdbc6_g\\ojdbc6_g.jar \n\nIn Server Scope- C:\\jdbc\\ojdbc6\\ojdbc6.jar \n\nIn this case value of JDBC driver path in WebSphere variable is identical. Nornally, If JDBC provider configure at server level then server level driver will get load first. But in this case since all three drivers are from same vendor, So we can not control which driver is picking up. In this case \n\"C:\\jdbc\\ojdbc6\\ojdbc6.jar\" should be loaded first but instated, ojdbc5.jar was load first\n\n[13. 4. 5 12:05:15:625 KST] 00000023 CompoundClass < loadClass \n\noracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver \n\nloader=com.ibm.ws.bootstrap.ExtClassLoader@5dc95dc9 \n\nsource=file:/C:/jdbc/ojdbc5/ojdbc5.jar Exit \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSYMPTOM\nDue to multiple JDBC drivers from the same vendor were configured in different scopes, the wrong driver class was loaded.\n\n\nCAUSE\nWhen multiple versions of the JDBC driver are configured in WebSphere Application Server, irrespective of the scopes, there is a possibility of a collision of the classes and we cannot predict from which version of the driver jar the class got loaded. \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n In order to support the existence of multiple versions of the driver jars, the \"Isolate this resource provider\" configuration helps to ensure there are no conflicts. This needs to be configured on each JDBC Provider. You cannot isolate only one resource provider, all the provider configurations in different scopes will have to be configured with the \"Isolate this resource provider\" setting. In this scenario, the resource provider classes from different versions of the jars are not imported or accessed to verify if the isolation has indeed worked. In order to use the server-scoped resource provider the datasource using the server-scoped jdbc provider will have to be referenced from the application after isolating the resource providers and using a resource reference in the application. \n\n\nGo to the JDBC Provider and enable \"isolate the resource provider\". When \"Isolate this resource provider\" is enabled, it ensures that only the jar that was specified in the classpath will be used for all the datasources under that particular JDBC provider. \n\n \n\nHere are links to Knowledge Center articles which contain further information on the setting: \n\n\nJDBC provider settings [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/udat_manjdbcprodet.html]\n\nConsiderations for isolated resource providers [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/rdat_isolatedlimitations.html]", "document_id": "swg21634612"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I need to understand details regarding Security Bulletin: IBM MQ Clients connecting to an MQ Queue Manager can cause a SIGSEGV in the AMQRMPPA channel process terminating it (CVE-2018-1371).

If the users need to base their data source on one of the above options, they will be able to do so by using a manual procedure via the Administrative Console. The automatic configuration process for Common Event Infrastructure should support these cases as well. \n\n \n\nLOCAL FIX: \n\nNone \n\n \n\nRECOMMENDATION: \n\nNone \n\n \n\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION: \n\nThe automatic configuration process with Informix database has been changed by adding to the configEventServiceInformixDB configuration Admin Task a new optional parameter -jdbcDriverVersion that will accept the following possible/acceptable values jta / 3.0 / 4.0. By using the \u2018jta\u2019 value it will configure the JDBC provider to use Informix JDBC Driver for JTA/XA. The usage of \u20183.0\u2019 value will determine the configuration of the JDBC provider to be based on the Informix Using IBM DB2 JDBC Universal Driver (XA) version whereas using the 4.0 value will produce the JDBC provider based on the Informix Using IBM JCC Driver (XA) version. \n\nThe introduced behavior is: \n\n 1. -jdbcDriverVersion not specified in the AdminTask - The configuration will be performed using 'Informix JDBC Driver (XA)', therefore Informix JDBC Driver for JTA/XA driver version. \n 2. -jdbcDriverVersion specified but no value supplied - Will raise an exception as -jdbcDriverVersion needs a parameter, then if the user goes so far as to use the parameter but does NOT supply a value, we give an error stating like in the following example \"CEIIN0739E No value was specified for the jdbcDriverVersion parameter\". \n 3. -jdbcDriverVersion specified with the 'jta' value supplied - The configuration will be performed using 'Informix JDBC Driver for JTA/XA'. \n 4. -jdbcDriverVersion specified with the '3.0' value supplied - The configuration will be performed using 'Informix Using IBM DB2 JDBC Universal Driver'. \n 5. -jdbcDriverVersion specified with the '4.0' value supplied - The configuration will be performed using 'Informix Using IBM JCC Driver (XA)', therefore based on the provider that supports JDBC 4.0 specification using the IBM Data Server Driver for JDBC and SQLJ version. \n 6. -jdbcDriverVersion specified with a value OTHER than jta, 3.0 or 4.0 - Will raise an exception like in the following example: \"CEIIN0701E The parameter jdbcDriverVersion contains the value <wrong_value>, which is not valid. Valid values are: jta, 3.0, 4.0.\". \n    \n    \n    The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in fix pack 7.0.0.9.

Eclipse changed the window system requirement from motif to gtk on UNIX operating systems. For AIX, this Eclipse window system change requires the gtk libraries to be installed to support the GUI. For Installation Manager, the GUI is the wizard mode of operation. \n\nYou can use Installation Manager without the gtk libraries. For information on console mode, command-line mode, or silent mode; see the Installation Manager Information Center [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1r6/topic/com.ibm.cic.agent.ui.doc/topics/c_modes.html]. Silent mode uses a response file and command-line mode is supported by all packages. For console mode, check your product documentation to verify that the product supports console mode.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nTo use the GUI, the gtk+ RPM and dependencies must be available on AIX. \n\n\nInstall this set of RPMs on AIX:\n\n\natk-1.12.3-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\ncairo-1.8.8-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nexpat-2.0.1-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nfontconfig-2.4.2-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nfreetype2-2.3.9-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\ngettext-0.10.40-6.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\nglib2-2.12.4-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\ngtk2-2.10.6-4.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nlibjpeg-6b-6.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\nlibpng-1.2.32-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nlibtiff-3.8.2-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\npango-1.14.5-4.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\npixman-0.12.0-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nxcursor-1.1.7-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nxft-2.1.6-5.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\nxrender-0.9.1-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nzlib-1.2.3-3.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\n\nThe installed RPMs must be of the minimum versions listed above.\n\nTo install the RPM versions specified above take the following steps: \n\n\n 1. Download the gtk2_bundle_v2.tar package [ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/aix/freeSoftware/aixtoolbox/ezinstall/ppc/] (version 'v2') containing all the RPMs and the install script to a new directory. \n    \n    \n 2. Decompress the tar file. \n    You can use the command tar -xvf gtk2_bundle_<version>.tar to decompress the file.\n    \n    \n 3. Open the decompressed directory gtk2_bundle_<version> and run the install.sh script.\n    \n    The script will check if the required RPMs are installed at the compatible level. If they are not, the script will prompt to install the compatible versions.\n    \n    \n 4. Verify the environment variable LIBPATH contains a path to the installed libraries. \n    For example LIBPATH=/opt/freeware/lib/\n\n\nNote that if you download and install RPMs individually, we have found that the following libraries are incompatible:  * glib2-2.14.6-2 and gtk2-2.10.6-5 \n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n#Unreadable characters in the GUI when using X11 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21661861]", "document_id": "swg21631478"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I need to understand details regarding \"Action required for SOA Policy Gateway Pattern For Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server for the GNU C library (glibc) vulnerability (CVE-2015-0235)\".

Collecting this MustGather information before calling IBM support will help you understand the problem and save time analyzing the data. \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n\n\nCOLLECTING DATA\nIdentified problems  1. Application server/agent server/integration is frozen or almost non-responsive  * \n     * Threads are stuck at database due to long running queries or due to blocking locks. \n     *  Long running processes taking significant time and/or too many threads running in parallel. \n     *  Stale entries in the database slowing down the processes with trying to ping every URL in yfs_heartbeat during cache refresh/broadcast. \n     *  Any network related issues \n     *  Frequent Full GCs of very long interval \n    \n     * \n     * 3 to 4 sets of Thread dumps collected at intervals of 20 to 30sec should give clarity on why and where in the process the threads are stuck i.e., At database, performing cache refresh, or any other reason. Note: Most JVMs redirects thread dumps to system out logs. It is necessary to redirect system out of JVM process to some log file to obtain thread dumps. for example, java > log_file 2>1& IBM java redirects thread dump to its own file. Look for an output file in the installation root directory with a name like javacore.date.time.id.txt \n     *  If blocking lock issue at DB, 'Blocking Lock SQL' output results need to be analyzed understand the processes, tables and the queries involved in blocking. \n     *  If overall DB slowness but not due to blocking locks, AWR report can be analyzed to identify the specific SQLs causing the issue. \n     *  If cache refresh is the problem, number RMI threads can be checked to see if the number is very high. yfs_heartbeat table records can be verified to check if there are too many stale entries. Stale entries can be updated temporarily. yfs_heartbeat can be truncated when all app/agent JVMs are down. Health monitor should run to avoid the situation in future. \n     *  If memory/GC is the problem, increasing the heapsize or tuning the GC parameters would help \n    \n    \n 2. Application/agent/integration server crash, shutdown  * \n     * Out-Of-Memory - Java heap space - causing the server crash \n     * OOM - StackOverFlow - causing the server crash \n     * Abnormal kill signal issues by external process/script/OS level  * \n        *  If OOM Java heap space, Memory parameters (Xmx, Xms), GC logs, thread stack (logs) and heapdumps need to be collected. \n        *  If OOM Stack-Overflow, Memory parameters (Xmx, Xms, Xss), Error logs and thread dumps need to be collected => Custom code issue or tuning Xss could help in most occasions. For waves with large number of shipments (nWMS), often seen that Tuning Xss helps (documented in perf guide). \n        *  Server level logs would help understanding if there are any external issues causing the crash. \n       \n       \n    \n    \n 3. Agent process is very slow, backlog of messages  * \n     *  Agent processing messages at very slow rate due to overall high time consumption => DB queries slow or long running process with additional services, external calls. \n     * Frequent Full GCs due to memory issues \n    \n     * \n     * SQLDEBUG logs of the agent. \n     * AWR report \n     *  GC logs. \n    \n    \n 4. Database: Too many blocking locks  * \n     *  SELECT for UPDATE queries fired by agent/application server are taking too much time waiting for acquiring lock. \n    \n     * \n     * Output of blocking lock SQLs \n     * AWR report \n     * Once above information is obtained, kill root blocker from DB side. This process will generate error stack in IBM Sterling Application logs. \n    \n    \n 5. DB high CPU, slow response  * \n     *  Slow response from database for the query fired by the product \n    \n     * \n     *  AWR Report \n    \n    \n 6. Deadlocks from application and agent servers  * \n     * Deadlock can occur between two or more processes \n    \n     * \n     *  Yantra Deadlock logs, SQLDEBUG logs for the processes identified \n     *  Oracle deadlock logs (if yantra deadlock logs not available) and AWR report \n    \n    \n 7. Application/Queue specific errors in agent logs  * \n     * Error details \n    \n    If possible, set yfs.app.identifyconnection=Y in customer_overrides.properties while collecting diagnostic data from database (blocking lock SQLs or AWR report or yantra deadlock trace).

Instead Microsoft provides a tool that you can download called Process Explorer [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653]. This tool identifies the open handles/files associated with the Java\u2122 process (but usually not sockets opened by the Winsock component) and determines which handles are still opened. These handles result in the \"Too many open files\" error message. \n\nTo display the handles, click on the Gear Icon [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&amp;aid=1] in the toolbar (or press CTRL+ H to toggle the handles view). The icon will change to the icon for DLL files (so you can toggle it back to the DLL view). \n\nIt is important that you change the Refresh Rate. Select View > Update Speed, and change it to 5 seconds. \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&aid=2] \n\nThere is also another Microsoft utility called Handle that you can download from the following URL: \nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896655.aspx [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896655.aspx] \n\nThis tool is a command line version of Process Explorer. The URL above contains the usage instructions. \n\n\nAIX \nThe commands lsof and procfiles are usually the best commands to determine what files and sockets are opened.. \n\nlsof \nTo determine if the number of open files is growing over a period of time, issue lsof to report the open files against a PID on a periodic basis. For example: \n\nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nThis output does not give the actual file names to which the handles are open. It provides only the name of the file system (directory) in which they are contained. The lsof command indicates if the open file is associated with an open socket or a file. When it references a file, it identifies the file system and the inode, not the file name. \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\nprocfiles \nThe procfiles command does provide similar information, and also displays the full filenames loaded. It may not show sockets in use. \n\nprocfiles -n [PID] > procfiles.out \n\n\nOther commands (to display filenames that are opened) \n\nINODES and DF \ndf -kP filesystem_from_lsof | awk '{print $6}' | tail -1 \n>> Note the filesystem name \nfind filesystem_name -inum inode_from_lsof -print > filelist.out \n>> Shows the actual file name \n\nsvmon \nsvmon -P PID -m | grep pers (for JFS) \nsvmon -P PID -m | grep clnt (for JFS2, NFS) \n(this opens files in the format: filesystem_device:inode) \n\nUse the same procedure as above for finding the actual file name. \n\n\nLinux To determine if the number of open files is growing over a period of time, issue lsof to report the open files against a PID on a periodic basis. For example: \n\nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nThe output will provide you with all of the open files for the specified PID. You will be able to determine which files are opened and which files are growing over time. \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\n\nAlternately you can list the contents of the file descriptors as a list of symbolic links in the following directory, where you replace PID with the process ID. This is especially useful if you don't have access to the lsof command: \n\nls -al /proc/PID/fd \n\n\nSolaris Run the following commands to monitor open file (socket) descriptors on Solaris: \n\npfiles \n/usr/proc/bin/pfiles [ PID ] > pfiles.out \n\nlsof \nlsof -p [ PID ] > lsof.ou t \n\nThis will get one round of lsof output. If you want to determine if the number of open files is growing over time, you can issue the command with the -r option to capture multiple intervals: \nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\nHP-UX \nlsof \nlsof -p [ PID ] > lsof.out \n\nThis will get one round of lsof output. If you want to determine if the number of open files is growing over time, you can issue the command with the -r option to capture multiple intervals: \nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers Runtimes for Java Technology Java SDK", "document_id": "swg21067352"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "We've changed the JazzSM DASH login page images and want to restore them.

However, this section does not show how to manage these instances from WAS Administrative Console.\n\n\nANSWER\nBefore configuring multiple IBM HTTP Server instances, note the following statements from the product documentation: \n\n * \n * It is seldom necessary to run multiple instances, as features like virtual hosts allow a single instance to efficiently serve many sites.\n * The advantage of a single instance is that it uses less resources to serve the same requests as multiple instances.\n\n\nIf you do need multiple IBM HTTP Server instances, this technote will help you set up the Web servers so that you can manage them from WAS Administrative Console. The technote assumes you will define the multiple IBM HTTP Server instances on an unmanaged node. The Administrative Console will manage the IBM HTTP Server instances using the IBM HTTP Server Admin Server instead of a nodeagent.  \n\n \n\n \n\nApproach 1: One plug-in installation for each IBM HTTP Server instance \nIf you want to run configureWeb_server_name script to define Web servers at WAS side, you need to install plug-in multiple times: Do one plug-in installation for each IHS instance. Each plug-in installation points to a unique IHS configuration file for the IHS instance and define a new Web server. Normally, plug-in installation is done as part of IBM HTTP Server installation. In the scenario of running multiple instances of IBM HTTP Server from a single install, you can only install plug-in for one IBM HTTP Server instance. For other instances, you need to install plug-in separately. You can either run \u201claunchpad\u201d command and select to install plug-in; or you can go to plugin subdirectory to run \u201cinstall\u201d command to install plug-in. \n\nDuring plug-in installation, the install wizard will ask you to select the type of Web server. Select \u201cIBM HTTP Server\u201d. Since Web servers are unmanaged, select \u201cWeb server machine (remote)\u201d. Select a unique location for this plug-in installation. Next, the install wizard will ask you the configuration file. Browse to select the configuration file for the IBM HTTP Server instance that will be associated with this plug-in installation. Make sure the port matches the Listen directive in the configuration file you selected. \n\nThe rest of plug-in installation steps are the same as you install plug-in when it\u2019s part of IBM HTTP Server installation. Refer to the Knowledge Center page below about plug-in installation:\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_7.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tins_webplugins_remotesa.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_7.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tins_webplugins_remotesa.html] \n\nAfter plug-in installation is done, run configureWeb_server_name script at WAS side to define the Web server. All instances of IBM HTTP Server can be managed by a single IBM HTTP Server Admin Server and one unmanaged node. That means you only need one admin.conf file for the IBM HTTP Server installation. No need to create multiple admin.conf files like you need to do for httpd.conf file. \n\nWith this approach, you need to apply plug-in upgrade multiple times (one for each plug-in install) when it is time to apply maintenance. Since IBM HTTP Server was installed only once, a single upgrade will upgrade all instances. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nApproach 2: Single plug-in installation for all IBM HTTP Server instances You can manage multiple IBM HTTP Server instances with just one plug-in installation. Manual steps are required to configure each instance. First, there is no configureWeb_server_name script to create Web servers on WAS side.

It is stabilized in the previous V7.3 release, but MQ Configuration will be supported as long as V7.3 is in support. The components in V7.5 are the IBM MQ Monitoring Agent and the IBM Integration Bus Monitoring Agent, both of which have enhancements in V7.5 that address monitoring requirements you may have. You can upgrade your OMEGAMON for Messaging monitoring components to V7.5 while using the previous release of MQ Configuration. \n\nWhether or not you want to continue using MQ Configuration when you install and configure OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5, there may be steps you need to take, so please review this document prior to installing and configuring V7.5. \n\nCONTENT\nFirst, please determine whether you have previously installed and configured the MQ Configuration component. If you have not done so previously, there is no need for you to consider the rest of this document. For this determination, please examine the following: \n\n\n\u00b7 SMP/E: Are the FMIDs for MQ Configuration installed? The FMIDs are HKMC730 and HKCF730, or HKMC710 and HKCF710 if you are using the V7.1 level. \n\u00b7 PARMGEN: In your PARMGEN configuration for each runtime environment, does the \u201cInclude Products in this PARMGEN RTE panel (KCIP@PGI)\u201d (under step \u201c1 KCIJPCFG Set-up/Refresh PARMGEN work environment\u201d navigation from the PARAMETER GENERATOR (PARMGEN) WORKFLOW - PRIMARY OPTION MENU), have the line for \u201cKMC OMEGAMON for Messaging \u2013 WebSphere MQ Configuration\u201d selected for configuration in the environment? \n\nIf the answers are \u201cyes\u201d to both of the above questions, then you do need to continue with the following general steps, which are documented in detail below: \n\n1) Determine whether there are any users of MQ Configuration in your environment. There are many cases in which the MQ Configuration component is installed and configured in PARMGEN, but no one is actually using it. It is important to determine this in order to decide which step to take next.\n\n2) If you do not have users of MQ Configuration, or you want to remove it anyway, there may be steps required when you are installing and configuring OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 especially if you previously configured a shared agent address space for MQ monitoring (KMQ) and MQ configuration (KMC) agents. \n\n3) If you do have users of MQ Configuration and want to continue supporting that usage, you need to follow recommendations when you are installing and configuring OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 upgraded products.\n\n\nHere are the details:\n\n1) Suggested ways to determine whether there are any users of MQ Configuration:\n\na. In the Tivoli Enterprise Portal (TEP), using an administrator user ID, click Edit->Administer Users to check whether any users or groups have access to the Configuration navigator view. For users and/or groups that have been configured for TEP, check the Navigator Views tab to see if any of them have \u201cConfiguration\u201d in their Assigned Views. If no one is allowed access to the Configuration navigator, then they are not using MQ Configuration feature. \n\nb. Another item to check in Administer Users is whether any user or group has the Permissions tab showing that View or Modify permission has been authorized for WebSphere MQ Configuration Authorities \u201cConfigure\u201d authority. Some user or group should have permission to use this feature if it is used by anyone. \n\nc. Check whether there are configured names that reflect queue managers in your environment. Click on the Configuration navigator in the view drop-down list in the Navigator pane, then click on Defined View on the left. In the middle Defined Tree pane on the workspace, expand the various \u201c+\u201d items, and with the help of someone who knows MQ queue managers in your environment, see if any of the expanded items reflect queue managers actually in your environment. There will be default and example items shipped with the product, but you are looking for names reflecting MQ at your site. If there are no names that reflect queue managers in your environment, then no one is using MQ Configuration.\n\nd. If it appears that there is usage of MQ Configuration, it would still be good to check with MQ users at your site to see if they actually require it. Perhaps they have experimented with it but do not actually use it regularly. If the OMEGAMON feature for MQ Configuration is not absolutely required in your environment, the recommendation would be to review all the ways that the IBM MQ product offers to configure and administer MQ, some of which are new in recent releases. Also, remember that the OMEGAMON MQ Monitoring agent offers the Take Action facility to issue any MQSC configuration command if the user is authorized.\n\n\n2) If there are no users of MQ Configuration, or you want to remove it anyway: \n\na. If you use a Serverpac that contains the upgraded OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 components to install, the MQ Configuration FMIDs (HKMC730 and HKCF730) are not installed because they are not included in the Serverpac.

Perform the following steps before you uninstall the Combined Cumulative Fix:  1. If you are running an external Web server such as IBM HTTP server, stop the Web server. \n     2. Verify that the information in the wkplc.properties, wkplc_dbdomain.properties, wkplc_dbtype.properties, and wkplc_comp.properties files are correct. If using multiple profiles, also verify that the information in each profile is correct. See the following link for multiple profiles Supporting multiple profiles: wp7 [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Supporting_multiple_profiles_wp7].  * Enter a value for the PortalAdminPwd and WasPassword parameters in the wkplc.properties file. \n         * Ensure that the DbUser (database user) and DbPassword (database password) parameters are defined correctly for all database domains in the wkplc_dbdomain.properties file. \n         * If using a database other than the default, grant permissions to databases within the framework by setting the DbUser (database user) and DbPassword (database password) parameters in the wkplc_dbdomain.properties file. \n         * Unix/Linux/Windows/IBM i Only: The WebSphere Portal Update Installer removes plain text passwords from the wkplc*.properties files. To keep these passwords in the properties files, include the following line in the wkplc.properties file: PWordDelete=false. \n         * Ensure that the value of the XmlAccessPort property in wkplc_comp.properties matches the value of the port used for HTTP connections to the WebSphere Portal server. \n         * WebSphere Portal 7 introduced support for multiple profiles.

The thread stack has a limited size and eventually its space will run out as the thread stack grows without bounds. \n\nSome traits of recursion: \n- Large thread stacks that appear to repeat \n- An infinite loop that continuously spawns off threads \n- Very large XML documents loaded into the Document Object Model (DOM) \n- JSP or servlets calling itself (usually by executing forward or include to itself) \n- Repeated calls in native functions \n\nIncreasing the thread stack size allows for larger thread stacks. However if the recursion continues to trigger a stack overflow, the next step is to identify what code is causing the recursion from javacores, thread dumps, or even system core files. \n\nA thread stack that indicates it's too large to display can be an indicator of stack overflow. This is especially true if the stack appears to repeat (such as recursive method calls). \n\nJIT/HotSpot Compiled Code \n\nThe JIT/HotSpot compiler (JIT) is designed to speed up the JVM execution times by compiling method calls. This can speed up execution time, but as more aggressive optimizations are used, this can inadvertently cause recursion, resulting in stack overflow or crash. The documents linked below explain how to debug JIT and HotSpot compiler issues:  * JIT Problem Determination for IBM SDK 5.0 and 6.0 using -Xjit [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21294023] \n * Debugging HotSpot failures on the Solaris and HP-UX operating environment [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21081179]\n\n\n\nDepleted Native Stack \nIt is almost guaranteed that a crash will occur if the native stack runs out of space. System cores can be used to identify long and possibly recursively looping native thread stacks. \n\nTo resolve, increase the native stack size (usually by adjusting the operating system limit for stack size) to accommodate the recursive native calls; however, identifying the recursive native calls will help determine the root cause of the stack overflow. \n\n\n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21162896&amp;aid=3] Back to top \n\n[http://www.ibm.com/i/v14/rules/dotted_blue_rule_443.gif] \n\n \n\nDetailed Configuration Options \n\nAdjusting the Stack Sizes (Xss and Xmso) options \nIf this does not work, you can adjust the stack sizes.

A packet trace is the key to capture the problem and confirm what type of failure is the cause. A log with event subscription of \"all\" \"debug\" will also help correlate and confirm the packet trace data.\n\nIn some cases, a simple work around to try is to lower the DataPower persistent timeout or disable persistent connections.

Signon fails and you receive messages DFHCE3542 and DFHSN1115 when you connect to CICS TS on a machine running RACF. When you connect to CICS TS running with CA-ACF2, the CICS TG connects to the region and the application runs fine. \n\nSYMPTOM\nDFHCE3542 sign-on is not allowed a the terminal. Your sign-on is ignored.\nDFHSN1115 date time applid signon at terminal by user userid has failed. signon is not allowed at a surrogate terminal except by use of the CRTE transaction.\n\n\nCAUSE\nA CICS trace of the working scenario shows [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21239217&amp;aid=1]CA Technologies [http://www.ca.com] CA-ACF2 replaces the SIGNON that checks to see if the transaction is on a signon capable terminal. In this case, the user is coming in on an APPC link. CA-ACF2 intercepts CICS' DFHSNP and calls DFHUSAD directly to do ADD_USER_WITH_PASSWORD. When RACF is being used the SIGNON command is not being replaced.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nOn the RACF region, you can do one of the following:\n\n\n * Use the EXEC CICS VERIFY command to verify the user \n * Perform auth checking before the user comes into CICS \n * Use the CICSTERM process\n\n\nUnlike the SIGNON command, VERIFY PASSWORD does not depend upon the principal facility, so you can use it when the facility is an APPC session.

JARs in the plugins directory have a list that specifies what classes in the JAR can be called. This is called the exports list, and it is honored by the class loader the server uses. Classes not on the list are considered internal use only. Thus, not all classes in the server plugin JARs are available to be called by user code. \n\nYou can call any method when the JAR is in the server's library directorym because it is not being treated as a plugin and a different class loader is used, one which does not implement the exports list.\n\nThe snippet editor is not aware of this mechanism so it treats a plugin JAR the same as a regular Java JAR file. That is it allows you to select the (unavailable) class and method to call in your program. The resolution is to make sure that classes you call in plugin JARs appear on the exports list. \n\nFor example you may search for StringUtils and find the class org.apache.commons.lang.StringUtils in the WebSphere JAR plugin/com.ibm.ws.jpa.jar. This class is used internally by the plugin and it is not exported.

You must operate at the Version 2.1 or higher firmware level. Subsequently, when moving from Version 1.0 or Version 2.0 levels to Version 2.1 levels, you cannot roll back to previous firmware versions.\n\nWhen upgrading from Version 2.1.0.x \nTo upgrade the collective while servicing workloads, you must complete the firmware upgrade process on one appliance before starting the process on another appliance within the collective. After upgrading one appliance, monitor the replication completion in the monitoring console before proceeding to upgrade the next appliance. Do not make any configuration changes until all of the appliances are on the same firmware level. See Updating the firmware [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wdpxc/v2r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.datapower.xc.doc/aa/aat_updating_firmware.html] in the WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance Information Center, for more information.\n\nWhen upgrading from Version 2.0.0.x\nWhen you are upgrading to Version 2.1.0.3 from a version prior to Version 2.1, you cannot run a firmware upgrade on a collective that is currently servicing a workload. When you upgrade a collective, all of the data that was loaded into the data grids is lost. The XC10 collective configuration is preserved during the upgrade process. When you are running firmware upgrades on the appliances in a collective, the appliance that you upgrade does not fully restart until all of the appliances in the collective are upgraded to the 2.1 firmware.\n\nWhen upgrading from Version 1.0.0.x\nYou cannot upgrade from this level to the most recent level. You must first upgrade to Version 2.0, and then upgrade to Version 2.1.0.3.\n\nINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS\nComplete the following instructions to download the firmware and client images. \n\n 1. Initialize and configure the appliance.\n    The firmware upgrades for the 9235-92x and 7199-92x appliances are available in this document.

You can create and manage a keystore using the standard Java keytool facilities as documented on the Sun web site http://java.sun.com/ [http://java.sun.com/]. \n\nOnce keystore is created, you need to modify 'server.xml' file located under server's conf directory.

Because we mandate that an IBM JRE is used, we need to use the IbmX509 algorithm for authentication. \n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nTo resolve the issue: \n\n \n\n 1. Open the 'server.xml' file for edit \n 2. Modify the last two entries 'keystoreFile' and 'keystorePass' as shown below:\n\n\n *  \n   *** text start *** <Connector port=\"8443\" maxHttpHeaderSize=\"8192\"\n   maxThreads=\"150\" minSpareThreads=\"25\" maxSpareThreads=\"75\"\n   enableLookups=\"false\" disableUploadTimeout=\"true\"\n   acceptCount=\"100\" scheme=\"https\" secure=\"true\"\n   clientAuth=\"false\" sslProtocol=\"TLS\"\n   keystoreFile=\"c:\\DOORS\\DWA\\keystore\"\n   keystorePass=\"changeit\" algorithm=\"IbmX509\" \n   \n   /> \n   \n   *** text end ***\n   \n   \n   \n\n3. Please note: the second last line on the above new entry was created a self signed certificate using the keygen tool using the IBM JRE ($DWA\\win32\\ibm-java2-i386\\jre) and applied the changes above in the 'server.xml' file.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Rational DOORS", "document_id": "swg21403991"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I need to understand details regarding Action required for IBM Integration Bus Hypervisor Edition V9.0 and WebSphere Message Broker Hypervisor Edition V8.0 for security vulnerabilities in Red Hat Linux.

Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as \"Bar Mitzvah Attack.\"\nCVSS Base Score: 5\nCVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/101851] for the current score\nCVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined\nCVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)\n\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS\nWebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance V2.1\n\nREMEDIATION/FIXES\nThe only remediation is to apply the following fixes: \n\nProduct VRMF APAR Remediation/First Fix \nWebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance 2.1 \nIT08240 http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/WebSphere+DataPower+XC10+Appliance&release=2.1.0.3&platform=All&function=all [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/WebSphere+DataPower+XC10+Appliance&release=2.1.0.3&platform=All&function=all] Verify that applying this fix does not cause any compatibility issues. The fix disables RC4 stream cipher by default. If you change this setting you will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the RC4 stream cipher and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions.\n\nWORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS\nFor WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance Version 2.1 will need to apply the appropriate fix. This will disable the RC4 algorithm used on the appliance.\n\nGET NOTIFIED ABOUT FUTURE SECURITY BULLETINS\n Subscribe to My Notifications [ http://www-01.ibm.com/software/support/einfo.html] to be notified of important product support alerts like this. \n\nREFERENCES\nComplete CVSS v2 Guide [http://www.first.org/cvss/v2/guide] \nOn-line Calculator v2 [http://nvd.nist.gov/CVSS-v2-Calculator] \nRELATED INFORMATION\nIBM Secure Engineering Web Portal [http://www.ibm.com/security/secure-engineering/bulletins.html] \nIBM Product Security Incident Response Blog [http://www.ibm.com/blogs/PSIRT] CHANGE HISTORY\n 24 April 2014 \n\n*The CVSS Environment Score is customer environment specific and will ultimately impact the Overall CVSS Score.

What is considered a normal deployment time and what can be done to reduce it? \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nWhen the deployment starts from the workbench, the engine is suspended and it takes some processing. It needs to stop all the worker threads in tag engine, entity manager and event manager. To stop each worker thread, it needs to wait for all the work completed by the current worker thread. For example, for entity manager, they have to complete all the entity management processing for the records in the internal queue before stopping, this is a normal phenomena.\nThe engine log can show what goes on in the processing for thread stopping for the polling threads for the entity managers and event managers. By default each one of these pollseconds for the entity and event managers threads can take as long as 10 seconds to stop.\nBoth event and entity managers take a pollseconds configuration parameter. \n\nIn version 11.0 onwards: \nEvent Manager: WAS_PROFILE_HOME/conf/com.ibm.mdm.mds.event.manager.cfg \nEntity Manager: WAS_PROFILE_HOME/conf/com.ibm.mdm.mds.entity.manager.cfg\nIn pre-11:\nEvent Manager: MAD_HOMEDIR/inst/instanceName/conf/com.initiate.server.event.cfg\nEntity Manager: MAD_HOMEDIR/inst/instanceName/conf/com.initiate.server.entity.cfg\n\nThere is a sleep used to execute the 10 seconds timeout. This sleep needs to expire before the thread can detect that it has been asked to shutdown. If you have 3 entity types there are: 2 (polling threads for entity and event manager) x 3 (entity types) x 10 (pollseconds) = 60 seconds spent just shutting down the polling threads. \nFor pollseconds we would recommend 1 second for the entity manager and 3 seconds for the event manager but this is the minimum value that can be set, you may multiple 1 and 3 by some number (2,3..) to keep the proportion. This should help to reduce shutdown times.\nThe 1 second poll time for entity manager is the lowest reasonable number. We need a delay so we don't flood the database with select requests causing the database to churn for no reason. The 3 seconds for the event manager is because the event manager should always poll less often than the entity manager to allow it to finish its work before event manager kicks off it's work. It should actually be much higher (at least 30 seconds) to group the work in nice chunks.", "document_id": "swg21711479"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Is Java 8 supported for EJBDeploy on WebSphere Application Server 8.5.5.9 or later?", "id": "TRAIN_Q165", "answers": [{"answer_id": 99638676, "document_id": "swg21994741", "question_id": "TRAIN_Q165", "text": "Please note that in WebSphere Application Server 8.5.5.x and below, the tool can only deploy Java EE applications compiled with a JDK level of 7 or below.

Some application server products' deployment tools alter the bytecode of your application classes rather than generating code ;however, the end result is similar. \n\nThe EJBDeploy Tool \n\nHistorically, EJB deployment in the Application Server product has been performed by the EJBDeploy tool, which is included with WebSphere\u00ae Application Server and packaged with the development tools for the WebSphere products. \nThe EJBDeploy tool inspects the external interfaces for your enterprise beans, generates wrapper code as .java files, and compiles the code using the javac compiler. The resulting .class files are packaged in your EJB module with your application code. For modules including and previous to EJB 2.1, the EJBDeploy tool must be invoked manually. \nPlease note that in WebSphere Application Server 8.5.5.x and below, the tool can only deploy Java EE applications compiled with a JDK level of 7 or below.

This vulnerability allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI thus altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.\nCVSS Base Score: 5.4\nCVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116466 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/116466] for the current score\nCVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined\nCVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)\n\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS\nFileNet Workplace XT 1.1.5 \n\nFileNet Workplace 4.0.2\n\nREMEDIATION/FIXES\nRefer to the Workarounds and Mitigations section below\n\nWORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS\nPrerequisite\n- For FileNet Workplace XT, ensure that you are on 1.1.5.2-WPXT-LA011 or higher.\n- For FileNet Workplace, ensure that you are on 4.0.2.14-P8AE-IF001 or higher.\n\nProcedure\n- Modify the following two sections of the security filter XML file.\n\n1) RegExpSecurityFilter filter\n\nThe \u201cRegExpSecurityFilter\u201d filter is a data type filter where the request parameter value is validated by its data type. The filter has two main sections called \u201cexpressions\u201d and \u201cparameters\u201d. The \u201cexpressions\u201d section defines the list of supported data types and their regular expressions. The regular expression is used to validate the request parameter value. Some of the predefined data types are Boolean, ipAddress, ipV6Address, number and so on. For a numeric data type, the expression definition is:\n\n<object key=\"expression\">\n<setting key=\"name\"> number </setting>\n<setting key=\"regexp\"> ^-?\\d+$ </setting>\n</object>\n\nThe \u201cparameters\u201d section contains the list of request parameters and the corresponding data types. For a numeric data type parameter, the parameter mapping definition is:\n\n<object key=\"parameter\">\n<setting key=\"name\">detailedPageSize</setting>\n<setting key=\"expression\">number</setting>\n</object> \n\nBased on these two definitions, the \u201cdetailedPageSize\u201d parameter value will be validated for numeric value only. Any other non-numeric value will be rejected by the filter.\n\nThe customer can add new \u201cexpression\u201d definitions and new \u201cparameter\u201d mappings needed to address their security requirements.\n\n\n2) ScriptSecurityFilter filter\n\nThe \u201cScriptSecurityFilter\u201d filter is a black list filter that evaluates the request parameter value for invalid script values. The filter will reject an incoming request if an invalid script value is found. Similar to the previous filter, the \u201cScriptSecurityFilter\u201d has two main sections: \u201cexpressions\u201d and \u201cparameter\u201d. The \u201cexpressions\u201d section contains a list of regular expressions that is used to identify invalid scripts. The customer can modify this regular expression list to define any new expressions needed to address the security requirements.\n\n<array key=\"expressions\">\n<value>&lt;\\s*img\\s*</value>\n<value>&lt;\\s*script\\s*&gt;</value>\n<value>&lt;/\\s*script\\s*&gt;</value>\n<value>\\s*javascript\\s*:|(^|\\s+)on[a-zA-Z]*\\s*=</value>\n<value>\\s*\\'\\s*[\\+;\\-]</value>\n<value>\\s*\\\"\\s*[\\+;\\-]</value> \n<value>\\s+STYLE\\s*=</value>\n</array\n\nThe \u201cparameters\u201d section contains the list of request parameters that will be checked against the \u201cexpressions\u201d entries for invalid scripts. The \u201cparameter\u201d section supports an \u201cincludes\u201d list and an \u201cexcludes\u201d list. All parameters in the \u201cincludes\u201d will be tested for invalid scripts.\n\n<array key=\"includes\">\n<value>eventTarget</value>\n<value>eventName</value>\n<value>dummy</value>\n<value>browserTime1</value>\n<value>browserTime2</value>\n<value>browserOffset1</value>\n<value>browserOffset2</value>\n\u2026..\n</array>\n\n\nFor more information:\nPlease refer to the following techdoc for more details on addressing Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities within FileNet Workplace XT and FileNet Workplace (Application Engine): http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27022201 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27022201] \n\nGET NOTIFIED ABOUT FUTURE SECURITY BULLETINS\n Subscribe to My Notifications [ http://www-01.ibm.com/software/support/einfo.html] to be notified of important product support alerts like this. \n\nREFERENCES\nComplete CVSS v3 Guide [http://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide] \nOn-line Calculator v3 [http://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0] \n\nRELATED INFORMATION\nIBM Secure Engineering Web Portal [http://www.ibm.com/security/secure-engineering/bulletins.html] \nIBM Product Security Incident Response Blog [http://www.ibm.com/blogs/psirt] \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThis vulnerability was reported to IBM by Roshan Thomas at secvibe.com \n\nCHANGE HISTORY\n 7 Oct 2016: Original version published \n\n*The CVSS Environment Score is customer environment specific and will ultimately impact the Overall CVSS Score.

For big environments the impact may be huge and it is better to re-run scans on selected endpoints instead.\n\n1) Ensure that the import is not running and stop the BFI/SUA/LMT server.\n2) To reset the sequence for all data sources and import all data, run the following query on the BFI/SUA/LMT database:\n\nDB2:\nUPDATE dbo.DATASOURCE_SEQUENCES set LAST_SEQUENCE = blob(x'0000000000000000');\n\nMSSQL:\nUPDATE dbo.datasource_sequences set last_sequence = 0x0000000000000000;\n\n3) Start the BFI/SUA/LMT. \n4) Run an import.\n\n \n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Security IBM BigFix Inventory", "document_id": "swg21977398"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Is it possible to get IIB General Availability (GA) code from somewhere else or is it only available on Passport Advantage?\n", "id": "TRAIN_Q179", "answers": [{"answer_id": 93112304, "document_id": "swg24027422", "question_id": "TRAIN_Q179", "text": "", "answer_start": -1, "answer_end": 0, "answer_category": null}], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "install; download; fix; product; DWA DOWNLOADABLE FILES\n\nABSTRACT\n This document describes how to download IBM Rational DOORS Web Access Version 1.4 components using the Passport Advantage Online website. \n\nDOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION\n\n\nTAB NAVIGATION\n * IBM Rational DOORS 9.3- selected tab,\n * Passport Advantage [http://ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage/index.html]\n\n\n\n\n\nIBM Rational DOORS Web Access versions 1.4 is a full product download.\n * Passport Advantage customers\n   Passport Advantage and Passport Advantage Express customers are required to sign in to Passport Advantage Online [https://www.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/softwareandservices/passportadvantage] to access the actual files.\n * \n * Non-Passport Advantage customers\n   If you or your organization did not purchase your software and support through Passport Advantage or Passport Advantage Express, you are required to sign in to the new IBM Software Group OEM Portal [https://www.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/softwareandservices/oem] to access the actual files.

If you need Business Process Choreographer Explorer to support insecure HTTP connections, you can use the unsecureExplorer.ant script to switch the protocol used from HTTPS to HTTP. \n\nAttention: It is not recommend to use the insecure HTTP protocol. Using HTTP for the Business Process Choreographer Explorer can open your organization to possible security problems.\n\nSwitching to HTTP\n\nIf you need to switch Business Process Choreographer Explorer from HTTPS to use HTTP, complete the following actions: \n\n 1. Download the unsecureExplorer.ant script file, which is attached near the bottom of this page.\n    \n    \n 2. If you previously switched Business Process Choreographer Explorer to use HTTP, but are performing this task again because you are installing an interim fix, fix pack, or refresh pack that updated Business Process Choreographer Explorer has reverted it back to the default HTTPS protocol, you must first delete the old (invalid) backup EAR file before running the script.\n    \n     * On Linux, UNIX-based and z/OS platforms, delete the install_root/ProcessChoreographer/internal/bpcexplorer_secure_backup.ear file. \n     * On Microsoft Windows platforms, delete the\n       install_root\\ProcessChoreographer\\internal\\bpcexplorer_secure_backup.ear file.\n       \n       \n    \n    \n 3.

If that happens and you still need the Business Process Choreographer Explorer to use the HTTP protocol, you must complete these steps again to re-enable the HTTP protocol. \n\n\n\nSwitching back to HTTPS \n\nIf you need to switch Business Process Choreographer Explorer back from HTTP to HTTPS, complete the following actions:  1. Change to the directory where the backup EAR file is located.  * On Linux, UNIX-based and z/OS platforms, its location is \n       install_root/ProcessChoreographer/internal \n     * On Windows platforms, its location is \n       install_root\\ProcessChoreographer\\internal\n       \n       \n    \n    \n 2.

To store values for user or group attributes beyond Virtual Member Manager (VMM) default file based repository's schema, you must extend the schema.\nTo do so, follow the procedure for running wp-add-property per the InfoCenter section corresponding to your operating system. This procedure includes restarting WebSphere Portal to pick up the VMM configuration changes. Refer to the link below for AIX. This procedure updates <profile>/config/cells/<cell>/wim/model/wimxmlextension.xml. \n\nFor example, running wp-add-property with the following values in wkplc.properties:\n\nla.providerURL=corbaloc:iiop:localhost:10031\nla.propertyName=testproperty1\nla.entityTypes=PersonAccount\nla.dataType=String\nla.multiValued=false\n\nresults in wimxmlextension.xml containing:\n\n<wim:schema>\n...\n[https://ecurep.mainz.de.ibm.com/aexfiles/pmr/1/3/13827%2C500%2C000/support_files/wimxmlextension.xml#]<wim:propertySchema ... dataType=\"STRING\"multiValued=\"false\"propertyName=\"testproperty1\">\n<wim:applicableEntityTypeNames>PersonAccount</wim:applicableEntityTypeNames>\n</wim:propertySchema>\n...\n</wim:schema>\n\nVMM's schema is now extended to include testproperty1 for entities of type PersonAccount stored in the file repository. You do not need to map the attribute as you would with an LDAP repository. You do not need to configure a database to store the attribute as you would with a property extension database.\n\nFile repositories can be identified in <profile>/config/cells/<cell>/wim/config/wimconfig.xml by:\n\n<config:repositories xsi:type=\"config:FileRepositoryType\"adapterClassName=\"com.ibm.ws.wim.adapter.file.was.FileAdapter\" id=\"InternalFileRepository\" supportPaging=\"false\" messageDigestAlgorithm=\"SHA-1\">\n<config:baseEntries name=\"o=defaultWIMFileBasedRealm\"/>\n</config:repositories>\n\n\nTo access this property via portlets installed by default with WebSphere Portal:\n\n1. Log in to Portal as an administrator and access the Selfcare portlet via Edit My Profile in theme. Alternatively, you could access the Manage Users and Groups portlet, then edit a particular user. 2. In portlet menu, select \"Configure\". \n3. Check \"testproperty1\" and click OK. \n4. Add a value for testproperty1.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n InfoCenter: Adding attributes (AIX) [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wpdoc/v6r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.wp.ent.doc_v615/install/aix_add_attributes.html]\nIf clustered - la.providerURL consideration [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21358381]", "document_id": "swg21421524"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "We are trying to perform the following steps on our Portal cluster...\n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHRKX_8.5.0/mp/install/add_attributes.html\n\nWe successfully ran the wp-la-install-ear task but now when attempting to run the wp-add-property task we see the following error in the ConfigTrace.log....\n\n [wplc-add-property] [2016-10-11 15:57:32.065] Can not find EJB:\n ejb/com/ibm/websphere/wim/ejb/WIMServiceHome\n [wplc-add-property] javax.naming.NameNotFoundException: Context:\n dmgrCell01/nodes/dmgrNode01/servers/dmgr, name:\n ejb/com/ibm/websphere/wim/ejb/WIMServiceHome: First component in name\n websphere/wim/ejb/WIMServiceHome not found.

This can be very helpful when a debug log level is needed to help isolate a problem or monitor behavior over a long period of time or can be used in production environment as DataPower only keeps a limited number of log files (the default is 3 files) in the file system in a rotational basis. \n\nCAUSE\nThe DataPower device has a finite amount of space to hold larger than average log files or long term logging needs in production environment. \n\nIt should be noted that if used while debugging at load or in a capacity issue, log events may be dropped. There is a prioritization of events within the device and client traffic always comes first. Log events dropped can be confirmed or counted from the Status>Log Targets menu in the WebGUI.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nConfigure a server daemon to listen and capture the DataPower devices events. First, this example shows how to create the log target sending events to a syslog destination. The other examples listed below will have their own strong points to be considered depending on the problem scenario. \n\n \n\nSyslog: \n\n* The syslog protocol operates over UDP which has no guarantee on packet delivery - a fast fire and forget method. \n\nTo create the new log target, go into the default domain: Objects > Log Targets \n\nConfigure the log target with settings as follows from the WebGUI: \n\n 1. Name the log target \n 2. Select Target Type of syslog \n 3. Fill in the Local Identifier with a descriptive string that may be used by a remote recipient to identify this specific log target \n 4. Enter the Remote Host Address and the Remote IP Port as in the screen shot wherex.x.x.x is the IP address of the remote syslog server that listens on port 514 \n 5. Take all other defaults\n\n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=1]  \n\n \n\nUnder the Event Subscriptions tab, you can select all and debug as indicated here: \n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=2] \n\n * \n * 6. Generate log events in the DataPower by using some transactions, for example by saving the configuration from the WebGUI or running some test load into a domain.\n\n\nSyslog-ng, will simply work over the TCP protocol to ensure the packet is delivered to the destination. The same consideration should be applied to a device under high load in that a log event could be dropped if not able to be wrote out to the network within time. \n\n \n\nNFS:\nAll NFS limitations apply from file size and permission settings. This is a more common approach using an NFS static mount to capture a log target and can allow for slightly more reliable messages to be logged. The limiting factor again is the speed of the network and NFS server response time. \n\n \n\nFile type: \n\nUsing a file type log target with a backup method as seen here:\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=3]\nThis will allow log events to quickly be written to a local file on the device's file system. Once the file reaches its set size a connection to the destination will upload the file from the device. This will upload with a unique time and date stamp on the uploaded file.\n\nThis is a useful method to capture sporadic problems. This is also useful for long running transactions that may span more than one file depending on device load.\n\n\nHTTP service:\nFinally a clever method that may be used in some senarios would be an HTTP service on the device.\nUsing an HTTP service configured in the following way,\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=4] \n\nOnce the file type log is created in the logtemp:/// directory, a client browser or wget type client can easily retrieve the file from the device. \n\nThis is very useful when there is no local or accessible remote log storage location to the device, due to firewall or network restrictions. \n\nThis is also removing the limitation of the device dropping the log event should it not be able to write the log event to the network. \n\nEach of the above methods are very useful and work better in some scenarios than others depending on the network, load, problem, and information needed.

For Windows platform:\nThe new item \"KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL\" is in KBNENV and KBNENV_<instanceName>.\n\na. Agent instance must be restarted to enable the new configuration change.\nb. The vaule of \"KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL\" in KBNENV_<instanceName> will be updated to \nthe same vaule of \"KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL\" in KBNENV while the instance is re-configured.\n\n2.

To verify that the agent was updated correctly, use the tacmd command\nto view the current version of the agent after the agent is restarted.\nYou are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer before viewing the agent version.\n\nFor example:\nOn UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring\ninstallation directory, the default location is '/opt/IBM/ITM'.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t or\n\nOn Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t bn\n\nNote: The component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is\nspecified as two characters (bn), not three characters (kbn).\n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is:\n07.10.03.00\n\nAfter the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify\nthat the agent was successfully updated.\n\nFor the agent on Windows systems, the version number is\n07.10.03.00.\nFor the agent on UNIX systems, the version number is\n07.10.03.00.\n\n2. To verify that the agent support files were updated correctly, use the\nkincinfo command on Windows systems or the cinfo command on\nLinux or UNIX systems.

Object names in MQSC commands are folded to upper-case (that is, QUEUE and queue are not differentiated), unless the names are enclosed within single quotation marks. If quotation marks are not used, the object is processed with a name in upper-case. \n\nWhen specifying the SET command with the following value CLNTUSER(testuser) the string 'testuser' will be folded to upper-case resulting in the following value being actually used by runmqsc:\nCLNTUSER(TESTUSER)\nAnd in this case, there is no record for the user TESTUSER (the record is for 'testuser').\n\n\nANSWER\nNOTICE that the userid mentioned in the CLNTUSER field of the output of the DISPLAY CHLAUTH command is NOT surrounded by single quotes. \n\nHowever, you MUST include the single quotes when specifying the value during an ACTION(REMOVE):\n\nSET CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('testuser') ACTION(REMOVE)\n1 : set CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('testuser') ACTION(REMOVE)\nAMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.\n\n\n++ Example of record with more attributes\n\nLet's examine the case when a record has more attributes, such as:\n\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') USERSRC(MAP) MCAUSER('user_1') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(ADD)\nAMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.\n\ndisplay CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL)\n9 : display CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL)\nAMQ8878: Display channel authentication record details.\nCHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP)\nDESCR( ) CUSTOM( )\nADDRESS(*) CLNTUSER(client_1)\nMCAUSER(user_1) USERSRC(MAP)\n\nYou want to delete the record and you try the following command which is based on the command that worked well for a simpler case. But this time, it fails:\n\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') ACTION(REMOVE)\nAMQ8884: Channel authentication record not found.\n\nYou try the original command that created the record, but changing the action to REMOVE:\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') USERSRC(MAP) MCAUSER('user_1') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(REMOVE)\nAMQ8885: Parameter not allowed for this action on a channel authentication record.\n\nThe attribute USERSRC is not a valid parameter for the REMOVE action (see table below).\nTherefore, by removing this attribute, then the following command worked successfully to remove the record:\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('mengano') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(REMOVE) \nAMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.\n\nSee:\nWebSphere MQ 8.0.0 > IBM MQ > Reference > Administration reference > MQSC reference > The MQSC commands > \nSET CHLAUTH [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm.mq.ref.adm.doc/q086630_.htm]\n.\n+ begin excerpt\n.\nUsage notes\nThe following table shows which parameters are valid for each value of ACTION:\n.\nAction \nParameter ADD or REMOVE REMOVEALL\nREPLACE\nCHLAUTH X X X \nTYPE X X X \nCMDSCOPE X X X \nACTION X X X \nADDRESS X X\nADDRLIST X X \nCHCKCLNT X \nCLNTUSER X X \nMCAUSER X \nQMNAME X X \nSSLCERTI X X \nSSLPEER X X \nUSERLIST X X \nUSERSRC X \nWARN X \nDESCR X \n.\n+ end excerpt\n\n\nAdditional Search Words: uppercase lowercase upper lower case\n\n \n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n WMQ MQ MQSeries", "document_id": "swg21577138"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "We have tablespaces defined under DB2 9.5 that apparently are not able\nto reclaim storage back to the OS, but does that mean DB2 cannot reuse\nthis space as well?", "id": "TRAIN_Q228", "answers": [{"answer_id": 80276679, "document_id": "swg21438047", "question_id": "TRAIN_Q228", "text": "To use the reclaimable storage feature, make sure to create the DMS or automatic storage tablespaces in DB2 Version 9.7 or later.", "answer_start": 1221, "answer_end": 1350, "answer_category": null}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "e\" is not available in tablespaces created in earlier versions(V9.1/V9.5) of the DB2 product. \n * Trying to alter a SMS tablespace as this feature is not supported on SMS tablespaces. \n\n\nExample testcase on a TEMPSPACE1 SMS tablespace. \n\n * \n * \n * DB21034E The command was processed as an SQL statement because it was not a valid Command Line Processor command.

This then returns a UNKNOWN status when the check is done. The default action for MQ is to not allow the channel to start and the AMQ9716 to be reported when the UNKNOWN is returned.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe best thing to do in this case is to determine the cause of the UNKNOWN return code and fix it. \n\n\nThere are two possible methods to discover which OCSP AuthorityInfoAccess URL is embedded in a certificate. \n\nMethod 1.\nPlace the certificate on a Windows machine; ensure to use a file extension of \"crt\" and double-click it. View the detail extensions for the AIA. \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21399255&amp;aid=1]\n\nMethod 2\nUse IBM Key Management (gskit) GUI to view them. Issue the following command::\nIn Windows: strmqikm \nIn UNIX: gsk7ikm (MQ V7) or runmqckm (MQ V8)\n\nFrom the IBM Key Management window:\nSelect View/Edit for certificate\nView Details\nExtensions\nAuthorityInfoAccess\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21399255&amp;aid=2]\n\nThe first step would be to insure that connection to the URL in your certificate can be reached.\n\n\nWork-around:\nUse this only as a temporary fix until the root cause can be found.\nYou can do the following. It will still do OCSP checking and if REVOKED is returned then the channel will not start. A GOOD return code will allow the channel to start. If UNKNOWN is returned it will not stop the channel from starting and the AMQ9716 will not be reported.\n\nUNIX and Linux systems add the following to qm.ini\nSSL:\nOCSPAuthentication=OPTIONAL\n\nTo set for a Windows Queue Manager, run the following command:\namqmdain reg YourQMgrName -c add -s SSL -v OCSPAuthentication=OPTIONAL\n\nThe OCSPAuthentication setting is also applicable to clients and can also be set in the client ini file (e.g. mqclient.ini). Changes to the client OCSPAuthentication setting will take effect after the application is restarted.\n\nOn a queue manager, users will need to issue a REFRESH SECURITY TYPE(SSL) command (or the GUI/PCF equivalent) in order for the change in SSL settings to take effect.\n\nOCSP provides your SSL channels with additional security. Once the cause of the AMQ9716 error has been addressed then you are strongly recommended to re-enable OCSP enforcement\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n OCSP Info [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.1.0/com.ibm.mq.doc/sy13000_.htm?lang=en]\n\n\n \n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n WMQ MQ", "document_id": "swg21399255"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "We have the OMEGAMON XE for Messaging on zOS.

Continue with the uninstallation process. \n   \n   \n   \n * Windows: Attachment Manager Symptoms: \n   \n   If you are installing an IBM product by using an electronic image from IBM Passport Advantage, and you are using Windows XP Service Pack 2 or later, your Windows Security settings might cause Attachment Manager to block the content of the installer .zip file, causing your installation to fail. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   To work around this problem, complete the following steps: \n   \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * Properties\n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * General\n    * \n    * Unblock\n    * \n   \n   \n   For more information about Windows Attachment Manager, refer to the Microsoft Support site at: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/883260 [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/883260]\n   \n * HP-UX: Runtime component supplied on a physical DVD The installation image for the WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 GA runtime component has exceeded the 700 MB limit recommended for a physical CD. For this reason, the installation image for the HP-UX platform is supplied on a physical DVD rather than a physical CD. The installation image for the WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 GA runtime component is also available from the Passport Advantage website. For information about downloading WebSphere Message Broker Version V8.0 installation images from the Passport Advantage website, see the Download WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 from the Passport Advantage website download document, which is available at:\n   http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24030968 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24030968]\n   \n   \n   \n * Installing using the fix pack installer Symptoms: \n   \n   The WebSphere Message Broker V8.0.0.0 GA runtime installer requires that you accept the license agreement.\n   The fix pack installer requires either that you install on a system that already has WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 GA installed, or that you provide the original WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 GA license files. The WebSphere message Broker V8.0 GA license files can be from either an existing V8.0 runtime installation, or from the original V8.0 installation media. The location of the license files is required only when you are installing a WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 fix pack on a system on which an installation of WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 GA has not been detected. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   GUI or Console installations\n   For a fix pack GUI or console installation where V8.0 does not already exist on the system, the installer will prompt you to provide the path to existing media licenses or an existing installation of V8.0.\n   Where V8.0 is already installed on the system, you should not be prompted for existing licences, and the installation will progress as normal. \n   \n   Silent installations\n   For silent installations (full media or fixpack) you must always accept the license, so for example \n   \n   \n   For a full GA silent media installation\n   Add the argument: -DLICENSE_ACCEPTED=TRUE to your silent command, or to the response file you have referenced\n   For example on windows command line\n   setup32.exe -i silent -DLICENSE_ACCEPTED=TRUE\n   \n   For a fix pack silent installation where V8.0 already exists on the system\n   Add the argument: -DLICENSE_ACCEPTED=TRUE to your silent command, or to the silent response file you have referenced\n   For example on windows command line\n   8.0.0-WS-MB-WINIA32-FP0001.exe -i silent -DLICENSE_ACCEPTED=TRUE\n   \n   For a fix pack silent installation where V8.0 does not already exist on the system\n   Also add the argument: -DExternal_License_Path=<path to licenses> to your silent command, or to the silent response file you have referenced\n   For example on windows command line pointing at the original media in the D: drive\n   8.0.0-WS-MB-WINIA32-FP0001.exe -i silent -DLICENSE_ACCEPTED=TRUE -DExternal_License_Path=\"D:\\messagebroker_ia_runtime1\\license\n   \n   Note if pointing at an existing installation of V8.0.0.0 the path is subtly different\n   For example on windows command line pointing at the original media in the D: drive\n   8.0.0-WS-MB-WINIA32-FP0001.exe -i silent -DLICENSE_ACCEPTED=TRUE -DExternal_License_Path=\"C:\\Program Files\\IBM\\MQSI\\8.0.0.0\\license\\8.0.0.0\"\n   \n   \n\n\n\n * Instructions for installing the WebSphere Message Broker runtime and ODBC Database Extender components with a non-root user ID Symptoms: \n   \n   In the information center topic \"Security on Linux and UNIX systems\" (bh26031), steps 3d) and 3e) for installing the runtime and ODBC Database Extender (IE02) components with a non-root user ID are incorrect. If you follow the steps described in the topic, the product will not install correctly. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   Replace steps 3d) and 3e) in the topic with the following new steps 3d) to 3i):\n   \n   \n\n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  /opt/ibm/mqsi and /opt/ibm/IE02 (for Linux) For example: SUDO mkdir /opt/ibm/mqsi\n   SUDO mkdir /opt/ibm/IE02\n   \n   \n   /opt/IBM/mqsi and /opt/IBM/IE02 (for UNIX and AIX). For example:\n   SUDO mkdir /opt/IBM/mqsi\n   SUDO mkdir /opt/IBM/IE02 \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n\n\n\n\n\nTOP Platforms \n\nUbuntu WebSphere Message Broker is supported on Ubuntu, but only for development systems. Production systems should not be used to run WebSphere Message Broker on Ubuntu. \n\nFor more information, see the WebSphere Message Broker system requirements page. The WebSphere Message Broker system requirements web page is available at:\nhttp://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wbimessagebroker/requirements/ [http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wbimessagebroker/requirements/] \n\n\n * Unable to connect a node that has multiple output terminals to other nodes (116214) Symptoms \n   \n   When attempting to connect a node that has multiple output terminals to other nodes, a connection is not created. \n   \n   Solution \n   \n   To work around this problem, complete one of the following steps: \n   \n    *  Set the following environment variable: GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS=1 \n   \n   OR  *  Use a different window manager \n   \n   \n\nSolaris and HP-UX \n * Increase in bipbroker and DataFlowEngine memory footprint on Solaris and HP-UX platforms Symptoms \n   \n   When upgrading from 8.0.0.1 to 8.0.0.2, bipbroker and DataFlowEngine processes running on Solaris or HP platforms might consume an additional 204 MB of memory. This is caused by an increase in the default size of the ReservedCodeCacheSize parameter in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) used by the broker processes. This area of memory is related to the just-in-time compilation of Java classes and was increased by the JVM supplier in response to an increase in bug reports from third party products failing due to exhaustion of space in the code cache. \n   \n   Solution \n   \n   Customers should use the default value for this parameter, but if this causes unnecessary resource contention, the default can be reverted to its former value by exporting the following environment variable in the broker's profile prior to starting the broker: \n   \n    * \n    * \n   \n   \n\nAIX  * DataFlowEngine abend on AIX when resolving hostname  \n   \n   Symptoms\n   The DataFlowEngine process running on AIX may terminate on startup or during a deploy with the following call stack in the abend/core file: \n   calloc [] \n   getaddrinfo [] \n   Java_java_net_Inet6AddressImpl_lookupAllHostAddr \n   \n   Solution\n   Apply AIX equivalent APAR fix for IV95824.\n   Alternatively apply one of the following workarounds: \n   1) Specify hosts resolution order in /etc/netsvc.conf so that IPv4 is resolved first. For example: \n   hosts=local4,bind4 \n   2) Export the following environment variable setting: \n   IBM_JAVA_OPTIONS=-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true \n   \n   \n\n\n\n\n\nTOP Migration \n * Brokers running fix pack 8.0.0.2 with new function capability enabled cannot participate in a multiple-broker global cache with brokers running 8.0.0.1. Symptom: \n   \n   After upgrading to fix pack 8.0.0.2, cache catalog servers fail to start. All cache components report BIP7190 warnings. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   In 8.0.0.2, by default, each WebSphere eXtreme Scale server participating in the global cache starts with a domain name that is derived by the broker.\n   Previously in 8.0.0.1 the domain name for all servers in all embedded caches was an empty string. Servers in different domains cannot collaborate in the same grid.\n   Therefore, for a cache that spans more than one broker, you must enable the new capability for these brokers at the same time. \n   \n   Enable the new capability by using the -f parameter on the mqsichangebroker command. \n   \n   Brokers running fix pack 8.0.0.2 without new functionality enabled can still collaborate in the same grid as brokers running 8.0.0.1.\n   In this scenario, the servers running 8.0.0.2 will continue to use an empty string as the domain name, and will report a BIP7140 warning message to the system log with this information.\n   \n   \n\n\n\n\n\nTOP WebSphere Message Broker Explorer \n * Connecting to a queue manager requires a SHARECNV value that is greater than 0 To connect the WebSphere Message Broker Explorer to a queue manager to receive publications, the SHARECNV property on that queue manager's SVRCONN channel must have a value that is greater than 0. This value is required if you want to use the Broker Statistics or Broker Statistics Graph views in WebSphere Message Broker Explorer.\n   \n   \n\n\n\n\n\nTOP WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit \n * Reset the Broker Application Development perspective after migrating Symptom: \n   \n   After migrating the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit and its resources to V8.0, items might be displayed in the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit that are removed in V8.0; for example, previous toolkit options in menus. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   To resolve this problem, complete the following step: \n   \n    * \n    * Window > Reset Perspective\n    * \n   \n   \n   After the perspective is reset, menus and views are updated for Version 8.0.\n   \n * Migrating or importing resources to a WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit V8.0.0.0 or V8.0.0.1 workspace, might result in erroneous errors. Symptom: \n   \n   After migrating or importing WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit and its resources to V8.0.0.0 or V8.0.0.1, erroneous errors might be displayed in the Toolkit. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   With your V8.0.0.0 or V8.0.0.1 workspace open in the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit, select Project > Clean... > Clean all projects. The erroneous error messages are removed.\n   \n   \n   \n * Importing resources into a new workspace might require project clean Symptom: \n   \n   When you import resources into a new workspace, error messages might display after autobuild is complete. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   In the Broker Development view, select your projects and right-click Project > Clean to rebuild the projects. After the projects are cleaned, the error messages relating to the import are removed.\n   \n   \n   \n * Specifying a new workspace with mqsicreatebar might require project clean Symptom: \n   \n   When you run the mqsicreatebar command and specify a new workspace, error messages might display. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   Use the -cleanBuild option when running the mqsicreatebar command to clean the projects.\n   \n   \n   \n * DFDL topics in the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit are displayed in US English only Symptom: \n   \n   When using the information center that is included in the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit V8.0.0.0 GA, Data Format Description Language (DFDL) topics are displayed in US English only.\n   These topics have the identifier \"dfxxxxx_\", where \"xxxxx\" is a five-digit number. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   This problem is fixed in WebSphere Message Broker version 8.0.0.1.\n   \n   Users of WebSphere Message Broker version 8.0.0.0 GA can view these topics, in a language other than US English, using the online product documentation. The online product documentation for WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 contains the latest translated documentation, and is available at: \n   \n   http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKM8N_8.0.0/mapfiles/help_home_msgbroker.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKM8N_8.0.0/mapfiles/help_home_msgbroker.html]\n   \n   \n   \n * Java, PHP, and Message Set projects having the same name can only belong to one Application or Library Symptom: \n   \n   If a customer has more than one application or library in their workspace which requires a Java, PHP, or Message Set projects having the same name, an error message similar to the following will appear:\n   The project < Project Name > can not be a member of multiple applications or libraries.... \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   Where an identical project is required in more than one application or library, a copy of the project should be made, and given a different name.\n   \n   \n   \n * Documentation contains incorrect instructions for installing the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit as a non-admin user Symptom: \n   \n   Non-admin user is not able to install Toolkit while following current installation documentation. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   This problem is fixed in WebSphere Message Broker version 8.0.0.1.\n   \n   Users of WebSphere Message Broker 8.0.0.0, who are installing Toolkit as a non-admin user, can refer to the online product documentation at [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmbhelp/v8r0m0/index.jsp]http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKM8N_8.0.0/mapfiles/help_home_msgbroker.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKM8N_8.0.0/mapfiles/help_home_msgbroker.html], or \n   \n   \n * Step 5 of the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit V8.0.0.0 installation documentation should be updated as follows:  * \n    * \n    *  On Windows run the following command: <disk1 image>\\installToolkit.bat -nonAdmin On Linux run the following script: <disk1 image>/installToolkit.sh -nonAdmin \n   \n   \n * Step 14 should be added to the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit V8.0.0.0 installation documentation and read as follows:  * \n    * \n    *  On Windows run command: <WMBT80_Home>\\wmbt\\postconfig\\postInstall_admin.bat On Linux run script: <WMBT80_Home>/wmbt/postconfig/postInstall_admin.sh \n    * \n   \n   \n * When using an application project and a subflow with a .msgflow extension it is possible to create a BAR file with a duplicate message flow if the sub-flows have been used incorrectly in the previous release. Symptom: \n   \n   This is caused when an External InputNode is added to the sub-flow; the resultant BAR file will contain two compiled message flows. One of the message flows will be the intended flow with the sub-flow embedded, the other message flow will be the extraneous sub-flow containing the ExternalInputNode without an appropriate ExternalOutput Node. \n   \n   When the BAR file is deployed both of the message flows will run. The sub-flow will incorrectly start a new thread and attempt to read data from the InputNode. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   Either : \n   \n    * \n    * \n    * \n   \n   \n   \n * Launching the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit from Installation Manager makes the toolkit use WebSphere MQ 7.0.1 Symptom: \n   \n   When an installation has completed, the user is provided the option to start the WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 Toolkit. When the toolkit opens, any broker which is running with a queue manager on WebSphere MQ version 7.1 or 7.5 will be reported as stopped, irrespective of whether the broker is running or not. A dialogue might be displayed warning the brokers can not be connected to. \n   \n   If a user tries to start one of the brokers which is stopped, an error message is displayed containing the following text: \n   \n   The queue manager '<QueueManager>' is not running (MQ reason code 2059 while trying to connect) \n   \n   Check that: \n   \n    * \n    * \n    * \n   \n   If a user tries to start one of the brokers which is already started, a dialogue is displayed indicating that the broker can not be started as it is already running. Solution: \n   \n   Shut down the toolkit and re-open it using the toolkit installation and not by using Installation Manager.\n   \n   \n   \n * A version of XULRunner which is not compatible with Eclipse 3.6 (upon which WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit is based) may cause the Linux toolkit to crash shortly after being launched. Symptom: \n   \n   Within a minute or so of launching the Linux toolkit, it crashes with the following error:\n   JVM terminated - Exit code=160 \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   Install a version of XULRunner which is compatible with Eclipse 3.6. \n   \n   Compatible versions of XULRunner are versions 1.8-3.6 and associated fix packs. \n   \n   Testing at IBM has been done using the following version, and this has been confirmed to resolve the issue:\n   http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/1.9.2.19/runtimes/xulrunner-1.9.2.19.en-US.linux-i686.tar.bz2 [http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/1.9.2.19/runtimes/xulrunner-1.9.2.19.en-US.linux-i686.tar.bz2] \n   \n   Expand the downloaded compressed file into a convenient directory ( e.g. /usr/lib/xulrunner_new) \n   \n   Add the following line to the eclipse.ini file under the mb install directory:\n   -Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.XULRunnerPath=<location of unzipped download> ( e.g. -Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.XULRunnerPath=/usr/lib/xulrunner_new)\n   \n   \n\n\n\n\n\nTOP Web Services \n * No known issues.\n\n\n\n\nTOP Web UI \n * Upload of WSDL on zOS in the Web UI is not supported On WebSphere Message Broker version 8.0.0.1 on zOS, you can not currently upload WSDL files using the Web UI for use in the Web Based Static Endpoint pattern.\n   \n   \n\n\n\n\n\nTOP Nodes  * After applying fixpack", "document_id": "swg27023600"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I need to understand details regarding Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in Diffie-Hellman ciphers affects IBM WebSphere MQ Telemetry (CVE-2015-4000).

This includes \u201cFREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys\" TLS/SSL client and server vulnerability. OpenSSL is used by IBM WebSphere MQ on HP-NSS and HP OpenVMS platforms. \n\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nCVEID: CVE-2014-3570 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3570]\nDESCRIPTION: An unspecified error in OpenSSL related to the production of incorrect results on some platforms by Bignum squaring (BN_sqr) has an unknown attack vector and impact.\nCVSS Base Score: 2.6\nCVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99710 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99710] or the current score\nCVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined\nCVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) \n\nCVEID: CVE-2014-3572 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3572]\nDESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could provide weaker than expected security. The client accepts a handshake using an ephemeral ECDH ciphersuite with the server key exchange message omitted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to launch further attacks on the system.\nCVSS Base Score: 1.2\nCVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99705 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99705] for the current score\nCVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined\nCVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) \n\n \n\nCVEID: CVE-2015-0204 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0204]\nDESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in the OpenSSL ssl3_get_key_exchange function could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain TLS connections. An OpenSSL client accepts the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. \n\nThis vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack. \n\nCVSS Base Score: 4.3\nCVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99707 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99707] for the current score\nCVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined\nCVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) \n\n \n\nCVEID: CVE-2015-0205 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0205]\nDESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote authenticated attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the acceptance of a DH certificate for client authentication without verification. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to authenticate without the use of a private key.\nCVSS Base Score: 2.1\nCVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99708 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99708] for the current score\nCVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined\nCVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N)\n\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS\nIBM MQ Appliance M2000 \n\nIBM WebSphere MQ for OpenVMS V6 \n\nIBM WebSphere MQ V5.3 for HP NonStop \n\nIBM WebSphere MQ Client for HP Integrity NonStop Server - SupportPac MAT1 \n\nIBM MQ Client for HP Integrity NonStop Server - SupportPac MQC8 \n\nIBM Mobile Messaging and M2M Client Pack (Eclipse Paho MQTT C Client libraries only) - Support Pac MA9B\n\nREMEDIATION/FIXES\nIBM strongly recommends immediately changing any channel definitions that use any of the following MQ CipherSpecs to use a stronger encryption algorithm; \n\n * RC4_MD5_EXPORT \n * TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5 \n * RC2_MD5_EXPORT \n * TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC2_40_MD5\n\n\nFurther details on MQ CipherSpecs can be found here [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm.mq.sec.doc/q014260_.htm].  \n\nIBM MQ Appliance M2000 \n\nA firmware update containing this fix is available, please contact your IBM Support Representative for further details. \n\n \n\nIBM WebSphere MQ for OpenVMS V6 \n\nThe version of OpenSSL used by MQ is provided by Hewlett-Packard.

After a successful handshake, the MQ protocol exchanges communications flows to negotiate channel startup, this processing detects an export ciphersuite being used where a stronger level of ciphersuite is required. In this scenario, the channel does not exchange any messages and logs an AMQ9631 error in the queue manager error logs before ending the connection. \n\n \n\nIBM Mobile Messaging and M2M Client Pack\nThe C client libraries provided by the MA9B Support Pac can also be rebuilt from source and linked against a newer maintenance level of OpenSSL 1.0.1 using the following instructions [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r5/topic/com.ibm.mm.tc.doc/tc10155_.htm].

Increase the \ntime out value and try the operation again.\n\n\n\n5.4 Agent support update\n------------------------\nFix 6.3.1-TIV-ITM_EXT-FP0001 included changes to the agent\nsupport files that must be installed. If you have already\ninstalled these updates, there are no additional installation\nsteps. Otherwise, use the following steps to update the Tivoli\nEnterprise Monitoring Server, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or\nTivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop.\n\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file \nto the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Servers, IBM Tivoli\nEnterprise Portal Servers, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal desktops. \n\n2. Expand the archive file using the tar command on UNIX systems or an \nunzip utility on Windows systems. \n\n3. Use the procedures in the \"IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Version 6.2.2\nInstallation and Setup Guide.\"\n\n4. Use the procedures in the specific database monitoring agent user's\nguide to complete the installation and configuration.\n\n5. If the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server being updated is remote (not a \nHub Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server) then restart the Tivoli Enterprise \nMonitoring Server.\n\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n========================================\n\n6.1 Verifying the update\n------------------------\n1. To verify that the agent was updated correctly, use the tacmd command to \nview the current version of the agent. You are required to log in \nto a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server before you view the agent\nversion. \n\nFor example:\nOn a UNIX system, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring\ninstallation directory, the default location is '/opt/IBM/ITM'. \n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t rz\n\nOn a Windows system, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis 'C:\\ibm\\itm'. \n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t RZ \n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is \n06.31.02.00\n\nNote:\nThe component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is specified \nas two characters (RZ), not three characters (KRZ).\n\n2.

These SQLs are executed only if there is a situation or \nyou click \"Link to SQL Result\" in the workspace \"Customized SQLs ->\nRDB Customized SQL Summary Definition\".\n\n- Problem: agent environment variable or error trace level do not take\neffective.\n- Workaround: If you must edit an environment variable such as setting a new\nerror trace level, the new variable must be modified in both the \ninstalldir/config/rz.ini file and the installdir/config/rz_<instance>.config\nfile, and you must restart agent.\n\n- Problem: agent report ORA-00942 error message in the log files like\nfollowing. Oracle Database Server is 10.1.0.2.\nERROR at line 1:\nORA-00942: table or view does not exist\nORA-06512: at line 128\n- Workaround: Run the krzgrant.sql script in 6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-FP0001 to resolve\nthis error.\n\n- Problem: tacmd listsystems command does not display proper version\nfor offline agent's subnode.\nFor subnode e.g. RZ:HOSTNAME-INSTANCE-CONNECTION:RDB, version is\ndisplaying as 06.31.01.XX, Status is 'N'.\n- Workaround: Check the version from the root node of the agent to get the correct\nversion, for example, for INSTANCE:HOSTNAME:RZ, the version is displayed as \n06.31.01.00. \n\n- Problem: After upgrading to Fix Pack 2 and configuring the Oracle\nDatabase Extended agent silently, the agent cannot\nconnect to the database, which is specified by the\nKRZ_CONN_STR parameter in the silent configuration\nresponse file.\n- Workaround: The KRZ_CONN_TYPE parameter specifies the connection\ntype. The Advanced type is required to configure a\ndatabase connection with the KRZ_CONN_STR\nconnection string. For example:\n\nKRZ_CONN_STR.connection=//host:port/service\nKRZ_CONN_TYPE.connection=Advanced\n\nTo solve the problem, update the silent configuration\nresponse file to specify the KRZ_CONN_TYPE parameter and\nreconfigure the agent instance silently. For example:\n\n# cat /tmp/silent_config.txt\n############ PRIMARY TEMS CONFIGURATION ############\nCMSCONNECT=YES\nHOSTNAME=tivp055.cn.ibm.com\nNETWORKPROTOCOL=ip.pipe\nIPPIPEPORTNUMBER=1918\n############ Database connection config ############\nINSTANCE=inst1\nKRZ_CONN_USERID=tivoli\nKRZ_CONN_PASSWORD=password\nKRZ_INSTANT_CLIENT_LIBPATH=/opt/IBM/oci\nKRZ_DYNAMIC_LISTENER=FALSE\n###\nKRZ_CONN_STR.asm=//tivx010:1521/+ASM\nKRZ_CONN_USERID.asm=sys\nKRZ_CONN_PASSWORD.asm=oracle\nKRZ_CONN_MODE.asm=SYSDBA\nKRZ_CONN_TYPE.asm=Advanced\n\n# /opt/IBM/ITM/bin/itmcmd config -A -o inst1\n-p /tmp/silent_config.txt rz\n\n- Problem: The Oracle Database Extended agent reports the error\nmessage ORA-03135: connection lost contact and the\nsubnode that represents the monitored database\nconnection is still offline in the Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nafter the monitored database recovers to active status..\n- Workaround: The Oracle Database might disconnect all active connections\nand reject new connections under certain circumstances.\nAn example is when resources such as CPU are exhausted\nin the Oracle Server.\nTo solve the problem, ensure that the Oracle Database\nand Oracle Listener are open to the new connection and\nrestart the agent instance.\n\n- Problem: After you upgrade to V6.3.1 Fix Pack 2, the subnode ID\nis truncated from 25 characters to 24 characters. The\noriginal subnode with 25 characters changes to gray, and\nthe new subnode with 24 characters is displayed.\n- Workaround: This behavior is expected. In 6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0001\nor later versions, the agent changed the maximum\nsubnode ID from 25 characters to 24 characters to avoid\nthe following problem, which is a known APAR for IBM\nTivoli Monitoring V6.2.2 Fix Pack 4: \"pure event cannot\nfire when subnode name length is equal to or greater\nthan 32 characters.\"\nTo avoid truncation of the subnode from 25 characters to\n24 characters, use one of the following two options:\n\nOption 1: Set the following variable to a value of 25 in\nthe agent environment variable files:\nKRZ_MAX_SUBNODE_ID_LENGTH=25. After you upgrade,\nthe default value is 24.\nNote:\n- On UNIX or Linux operating systems, the\nenvironment variable files include\ninstalldir/config/rz.ini and installdir/config/\nrz_instance.config.\n- On Windows operating systems, the environment\nvariable files include installdir\\TMAITM6\\\nKRZENV_instance (32-bit) or installdir\\\nTMAITM6_X64\\KRZENV_instance (64-bit).\n\nOption 2: Reduce the length of the database\nconnection name, agent instance name, or host name;\nor, see Changing default naming conventions for\ndatabase connections in the Installation and\nConfiguration Guide for the Oracle Database Extended\nagent for information.\n\n8.0 Additional product information\n==================================\nNone.\n\n\n9.0 Notices\n===========\nThis information was developed for products and services offered \nin the United States.

Although these connections will eventually be discarded through the normal processing of the connection requests, it may be desirable to purge them all at once and allow the pool to refill with new, valid connections.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nWebSphere Application Server has an operation on the data source MBean that can be used to purge the connection pool. WebSphere Application Server MBean may be called via the wsadmin console, see the IBM Information Center topic \"Scripting the application serving environment (wsadmin)\" for more details. The operation name is: purgePoolContents. \n\nThe purgePoolContents operation has two options: \n\n 1. Normal:  * This is the default option. \n     * Existing in-flight transactions will be allowed to continue work. \n     * Shared connection requests will be honored. \n     * Free connections are cleaned up and destroyed. \n     * In use connections (for example: connections in transactions) are cleaned up and destroyed when returned to the connection pool. \n     * A close() call issued on any connection obtained prior to the purgePoolContents will be done synchronously (for example: wait for the jdbc driver to return before proceeding). \n     * Requests for new connections (not handles to existing old connections) will be honored.\n       \n       \n    \n    \n 2. Immediate:  * No new transactions will be allowed to start on any connections obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call. Instead, a StaleConnectionException is thrown. \n     * No new handles will be handed out on any connections obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call. Instead, a StaleConnectionException is thrown. \n     * Existing in-flight transactions will be allowed to continue work. Any new activities on a purged Connection will cause a StaleConnectionException or an XAER_FAIL exception (in the case of XA) \n     * A close() call issued on any connection obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call will be done asynchronously (for example: no waiting for the jdbc driver to return) This is useful if the driver returns. \n     * Due to the fact that close() does not wait, the number of connections will be decremented immediately in WebSphere Application Server. This might cause the total number of connections in WebSphere Application Server to be temporarily out of sync with the database total number of connections. \n     * Requests for new connections (for example: not handles to existing old connections) will be honored.\n    \n    \n\n\nExamples of operations that can be executed on the data source MBean using the wasdmin console:  1. List all data sources:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl queryNames *:type=DataSource,*\n    \n    Using Jython:\n    AdminControl.queryNames(\"*:type=DataSource,*\")\n    \n    \n 2. Initialize a variable to specify a data source (this example uses Default Datasource, but any data source name listed in the output of above command can be used):\n    Using Jacl:\n    set name \"Default Datasource\"\n    set ds [$AdminControl queryNames *:type=DataSource,name=$name,*] \n    \n    Using Jython:\n    name = \"Default Datasource\"\n    ds = AdminControl.queryNames(\"*:type=DataSource,name=\"+name+\",*\") \n    \n    \n 3. View the pool contents by invoking the showPoolContents operation of the data source MBean:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl invoke $ds showPoolContents\n    \n    Using Jython:\n    print AdminControl.invoke(ds, \"showPoolContents\")\n    \n    \n 4. View contents of all pools by invoking the showAllPoolContents operation of the data source MBean:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl invoke $ds showAllPoolContents\n    \n    \n    Using Jython:\n    print AdminControl.invoke(ds, \"showAllPoolContents\")\n    \n    \n 5. Immediately purge the pool by invoking the purgePoolContents operation of the data source MBean with the immediate option:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl invoke $ds purgePoolContents immediate\n    \n    \n    Using Jython:\n    AdminControl.invoke(ds, \"purgePoolContents\", \"immediate\")\n    \n    \n\nIf the purge operation is successful, no response will be observed. If the purge operation is not successful, the response will indicate a possible reason for failure. One common reason for failure is attempting to purge the contents of a connection pool which is not yet available (the connection pool is not created until a naming look-up of the associated datasource or connection factory occurs), resulting in an illegal state exception.  \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers Runtimes for Java Technology Java SDK Application Servers WebSphere Application Server for z/OS Java SDK z/OS 8.0, 7.0, 6.1", "document_id": "swg21220832"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "\n\nUsers receive the following error on selecting a data source from the list defined in IBM Cognos within Framework Manager 10.2.2 Fix Pack 5\n\nalt text\n\nThat error (BMT-IMP-0002 Failed to Execute Metadata request.

There is a deliberate change in the default behaviour between the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS and the WebSphere MQ V7.1 (and later) classes for JMS regarding the default user identifier flowed to the queue manager.\nFrom the WebSphere MQ V7.1 classes for JMS onwards, a non-blank user identifier is always flowed to the queue manager when creating a connection to WebSphere MQ. This is true even if no user identifier has been specified, or a blank or null user identifier has been specified; for example by calling:\n\nMQConnectionFactory.createConnection();\n\nor:\n\nMQConnectionFactory.createConnection(\u201c\u201d, \u201c\u201d);\n\nor:\n\nMQConnectionFactory.createConnection(null, null);\n\nIn the case where a null or blank user identifier has been specified, the WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later classes for JMS will query the value of the Java System Property user.name. The value of this property is flowed to the queue manager for authorization.\n\nAs a result, if the user identifier specified by the Java System Property user.name is not authorized to access the queue manager, the queue manager will return an exception to the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS with Reason Code MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED and the connection to the queue manager will not be established.\n\nThis change in behaviour could affect topologies that previously relied on the default behaviour in the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS that flowed a blank user identifier when establishing a CLIENT mode transport connection. The expectation that a blank or null user identifier will be flowed by default, and that the user identifier that started the WebSphere MQ server-connection channel would be used by the queue manager when performing the authorization checks, is no longer valid from the WebSphere MQ V7.1 classes for JMS.\n\nIn the case outlined above, system administrators that are currently relying on the default behaviour of the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS should review their configurations regarding the use of user identifiers and authorization. This might also help to improve security within their WebSphere MQ topology.\n\n\nIn summary, the change in behaviour will affect users of:\n\n- The WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later classes for JMS.\n\n- The WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later JCA Resource Adapter that includes the classes for JMS.\n\n- Versions of WebSphere Application Server that include the WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later JCA Resource Adapter. Currently this is WebSphere Application Server V8.5.0.0 and later.\n\n\nThe com.ibm.mq.jms.ForceUserID Java System Property\n\nA Java System Property called \u201ccom.ibm.mq.jms.ForceUserID\u201d was introduced as part of APAR IZ49302 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ49302] and included from WebSphere MQ V6.0.2.8 and WebSphere MQ V7.0.1.\n\nThe changes made as part of this APAR could be used to change the default behaviour in the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS regarding the user identifier value flowed to the queue manager when creating a connection.\n\nThis property is no longer valid from WebSphere MQ V7.1. Setting this property will have no affect on the WebSphere MQ V7.1 classes for JMS and later.\n\nOther Useful Resources\n\nWebSphere MQ Documentation\n\nThe WebSphere MQ Documentation contains a section on planning user authorization which also includes a description on access control for clients.

The discussion in this case refers to Rational Application Developer v7 and WebSphere Application Server v6.0 as per the originally reported user scenario.\n\n\n Background on Server Publish Settings:\n\nThe WebSphere Application Server v6.1 server settings in the Rational Application Developer v7 in the server overview editor (such as double click or right-click > open on the server in the Servers view) defaults to the setting: \n\n> Publishing\n* Run server with resources within the workspace\n, and its associated\n[x] Minimize application files copied to the server\n\nwhile the WebSphere Application Server v6.0 setting has the option 'Minimize application files copied to the server' disabled.\n\nThis is the default setting which uses the Rational Application Developer WebSphere Application Server server tooling loose configuration capability combined with WebSphere Application Server v6.x server WebSphere Rapid Deploy capability. This will be referred to as the loose configuration scenario.\n\nIn the loose configuration scenario, the server runs the EAR application located directly from the various output folders from the projects in the workspace. Think of the server as keeping handles/pointers for your EAR (and its modules) to their location in the workspace. It also uses a combination of Eclipse/WTP and WebSphere Application Server related metadata information. It does not actually install the EAR and its modules physically to the server as for a stand-alone WebSphere Application Server V6.x server as would be done with the option:\n* Run server with resources on Server\n\nNotes:\n1. The WebSphere Application Serve v7+ admin console will not even show an [OK] button when attempting to associate an Shared Library to an EAR if proper settings are not used in Server Tools\nWhenever an EAR is in the workspace ,as in when using publishing option in RAD: \n\"Run Server with resources from the workspace\"\n, there will always be some settings in the WAS admin console related to the EARs that will be greyed/grayed out and you cannot configure. This occurs because the EAR in not physically installed on the server profile, and results in certain limitation when using the admin console. It is necessary to use the option \n\"Run server with resources on the server\" \nto enable these classloading options. Otherwise using \"Run Server with resources from the workspace\" is recommended for optimal publishing of EAR(s) and making code changes.\n\n2. To better understand loose configuration/loose-config/looseconfig.xmi:\nHow to compare a single-root module to a non single-root module [www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21302931]\n\n\nShared Library Solution:\n\nShared Libraries configured on an EAR in the WebSphere Application Server v6.x admin console are not completely supported unless you use: \"Run server with resources on Server\".\n\nThe WebSphere Application Server V6.x Administrative Console does not handle loosely-installed applications well. However, it usually will work with Shared Libraries when:\n\n* Run server with resources within the workspace\n\nif its associated option\n\n[ ] Minimize application files copied to the server\n\nis unchecked.\nIt is worth while attempting to clear this option, as it often works and allows you to continue to work with the rapid deployment advantages of working with the application as it in the workspace and having those changes picked up with the default auto-publish.\n\nAfter making any of the above changes in the Server Overview editor, make sure to Remove your project/EAR from the server and then Add your project/EAR to the server for the new changes to take effect. It may also be necessary to restart the server.\n\nNote: Any shared library jars need to be added to the Java Build Path of any project in a RAD workspace, that has a build/compile time dependency on those jars. RAD would not be aware of any jars configured as a shared library in the WAS admin console for an EAR/WAR.\n\n\nShared Library Recommended Practice: \n\nDisabling/unchecking Minimize application files copied to the server with Run server with resources within the workspace is not a proper work-around. The server tools cannot guarantee what the WebSphere Application Server run time will do in these cases when they are constantly updating the EAR (that is, the relationship between the EAR and the shared library could potentially be destroyed). Once the application code/configuration is not going through many changes, it will usually work\n\nWhen developing, if you really want to have a shared library in a loose-config scenario then you should use the Enhanced EAR editor to define the shared libraries. This would be done in the EAR Deployment Descriptor editor under: Deployment Tab : Shared Libraries .\nWhen using the Enhanced EAR there is a limitation. Application-scoped shared libraries cannot depend on application-scoped variables (==substitution variables) to specify their location. If application-scoped variables are needed to specify a shared library, select them in the admin console at the cell, node or server scope instead. If needed, consult WebSphere Application Server server support on this limitation.\n\nWhen you are ready to export the EAR to an actual test/production server, you can In Rational Application Developer v6/v7 delete the {workspace}\\MyEAR\\META-INF\\ibmconfig folder containing the Deployment Tab information for the Enhanced EAR, before exporting the EAR (or in the EAR itself using whatever compressed file utility you may have).\nThen, in the actual production server set the Shared Libraries in the admin console on the installed EAR\nand define whatever other resources may have been configured in the Enhanced EAR.\n\nNote - Rational Application Developer v7.0 WebSphere Application Server v6.1 Shared Library \"admin console\" - Error ADMA017EE and WSVR0501E:\n\nIf using WebSphere Application Server v6.1, upgrading to WebSphere Application Server v6.1.0.13 or later is recommended, because of known APAR/defect:\nPK49029: IN WSAS RUNTIME SERVER FAILS TO START AFTER ASSOCIATING SHARED LIBRARY WITH AN ENTERPRISE APPLICATION\nThis involved the use of \"Run server with resources in the workspace\" as well as\n\"Minimize application files copied to the server\", and the error:\nWSVR0501E: Error creating component com.ibm.ws.runtime.component.ApplicationMgrImpl@5d125d12 .\n\nThe above is an example of why it is useful to try testing with the WAS server version having the latest fixpack applied when working with with RAD server tools. Similarly apply the latest fixpack to your RAD version. There have been ongoing improvements and fix(s) involving loose-config in both RAD and WAS. \n\nContact IBM Support for RAD if the above information did not help.\n\n\nUseful WebSphere Application Server ClassLoader information:\n\nFrom a WebSphere\u00ae Application Server (WAS) classloading/class loader perspective, in this case WebSphere Application Server v6.1, it is useful to consult the RedPaper: WebSphere Application Server V6.1: Classloader Problem Determination, [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpapers/pdfs/redp4307.pdf] which addresses use of Shared Libraries, or the general url under Related information. Also, the class loader/loading chapters in the System Management & Configuration Handbooks for the various WebSphere Application Server server versions under Related information, provide similar background information. Specific to WebSphere Application Server v5.1 there is the red piece: WebSphere Application Server V5: Using Shared Library Support.\n\nUnder Related information, the Rational Application Developer v7.0 technote: J2EE classpath Container Preferences with Java Build Path and J2EE Module Dependencies Properties, is useful from the perspective of the use of Java utility projects/jars by J2EE Projects.\n\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Education For RAD v6/WASv6 Server tooling [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21199368]\nWAS V6.1 Classloader Problem Problem Determination [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/redp4307.html?Open]\nWAS V6.1 System Management and Configuration [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg247304.html?Open]\nWAS V6.0 System Management and Configuration [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg246451.html?Open]\nRADv7.0 - J2EE classpath Container Preferences with..

The same goes for the product libraries used by your client applications.\n\n\nVersions of modules are given in the standard IBM format V.R.M.F which stands for Version.Release.Modification.Fixpack. See the V.R.M.F Maintenance Stream Delivery Vehicle terminology explanation [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27008656] for more details.\n\n\n\nNot using the exact same version is not supported as it can cause unexpected behaviors.\n\nThis means that support will assist with problems on such non-supported configurations by testing with all modules at the same version/fix pack:\n\n\n * If the issue happens to be caused by the mix of versions/fix packs, the solution will be to put all modules at the same version/fix pack. \n * If the issue is fixed in a latest fix pack, the solution will be to apply it on all your modules.\n\nANSWER\nJRules or ODM are made of several modules which components versions can be obtained in different ways. The below tables explain how to get the version information of each deployed product components, depending on whether you are using JRules or ODM. \n\n \n\n \n\nYou will also need to consider any of your applications using the JRules/ODM libraries, including any Monitored Transparent Decision Service (MTDS) or web service generated through the Rule Studio or Rule Designer \"Client for RuleApp\" wizards. \n\nFor those, you will need to find the product JARs you packaged in your WARs and/or EARs deployed to the server, or present in the classpath of your stand-alone Java applications. Those JARs are typically named jrules-xyz.jar. \n\nThe product version information of those libraries is specified at the \"Implementation-Version: ...\" line of the MANIFEST.MFfile found under theMETA-INF folder of each JARs. \n\n \n\n * For WODM/ODM modules:\n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21400738&amp;aid=1]\nComponent [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21400738&amp;aid=1]\nWhere to find the version [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21400738&amp;aid=1]\nRule & Event Designer [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21400738&amp;aid=1]\nIn \"Help > About Eclipse SDK \", click the \"IBM\" button.

It happens due to the way that data is presented in CSV reports and on the user interface. \n\nThe All IBM Metrics and IBM PVU subcapacity reports are multilevel, and consist of the following levels:\n1. First level: a list of all products\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=2] \n\n\n2.

However, it has to present the same information that the report that is available in the user interface. Below is an excerpt from the audit snapshot that corresponds to the report that was presented on the screen shots above (some columns are hidden in the snapshot to simplify it).\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=5] \n\n \n\nWhen values in column M are added, PVU consumption equals 480 PVUs. However, these values should not be added because they all refer to a single server (TLM_VM_423\u2026) on which the four VMs run, not an individual VM that is listed in column P (Computer). \n\nThe value in column M is repeated due to the way data needs to be presented in a CSV file. If you want to relate back the value from column M in the audit snapshot to the user interface report, it is the value that you can see in the column PVU Subcapacity Limit on the second level of the report. The value in column L relates back to the column CPU Core Subcapacity on the second level of the report. \n\n \n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=6] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=6] \n\n\nPVU and RVU MAPC subcapacity license terms specify license consumption only on the physical server level.

One shortcut is an immediate upgrade to a newer compatible Java SDK service release, before gathering detailed problem determination data. \n\nThere are multiple advantages to performing an immediate Java SDK upgrade as a quicker path to resolution over a full Problem Determination (PD) process: \n 1. There is a continuous stream of fixes going into the Java SDK. Many problems encountered by customers are resolved by these fixes.\n    \n    \n 2. When a new problem is encountered, applying the latest Java SDK is a quick way to determine if related fixes change the symptoms or correct the problem.\n    \n    \n 3. Many documented Java SDK fixes have common symptoms. Frequently, limited PD data does not isolate the problem to a single root cause.\n    \n\n\nThese factors highlight the advantage of applying a newer Java SDK before working through a full PD cycle. \n\nJava SDK and WebSphere Application Server software are updated frequently.

Navigate to the IBM SPSS Statistics/Modeler directory and open \"spssprod.inf\", using any text editor. \n\n - By default, SPSS Statistics would store this file in: C:\\Program Files\\IBM\\SPSS\\Statistics\\xx\\ \n\n - By default, SPSS Modeler would store this file in: C:\\Program Files\\IBM\\SPSS\\Modeler\\xx.x\\bin\\\n\n2. Verify the \"DaemonHost\" value matches the Hostname or IP Address of the machine where the Safenet Sentinel License Manager is installed. \n\n - E.g. DaemonHost=MyLicenseServer or DaemonHost=127.0.0.1\n\nIf the DaemonHost value specifies redundant license servers, please do the following if you are using SPSS Statistics 22 (or earlier) or SPSS Modeler 16.0 (or earlier):\n\n\n a). Remove all license servers from the \"DaemonHost\" line and save the file.\n\nb). Create a system environment variable, called LSHOST, on each SPSS client with your redundant license servers as its value. Separate each redundant license server with a colon, e.g.\n==========================\nVariable: LSHOST\nValue: server1:server2:server3\n========================== \n\n\n\nIf the \"DaemonHost\" value is accurate and you are using a Hostname value, you have a name resolution problem. Error # 2070, Symptom number 3 typically means the SPSS client cannot connect to the name resolution database or the name resolution database does not contain a record for the machine where the SPSS Sentinel License Manager resides. To verify, please do the following:\n\n1. Run lswhere.exe (which is located in the SPSS directory, see above) from the problematic SPSS Client machine and take note of the displayed output. The following is an example of the output: \n\n\n==========================\nSentinel LM 8.x.x Search Tool For License Servers\nCopyright (C) 20xx Rainbow Technologies, Inc.\n\nServer Address : xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\nServer Name : Machine_A\n========================== \n\n\nIf the Safenet Sentinel License Manager machine is not listed or you encounter the error, \"Error[17]: Probably no servers are running on this subnet.\", please add the following system environment variable to the IBM SPSS Statistics/Modeler client and run lswhere.exe again: \n\n\n==========================\nVariable: LSHOST\nValue: Name or IP address of the License Manager machine \n========================== \n\n\nFor information about defining environment variables, see the Network License Administrator's Guide. If using the LSHOST environment variable does not render the Safenet Sentinel License Manager machine, try using LSFORCEHOST instead.\n\n2. When you see the Safenet Sentinel License Manager machine name and corresponding IP address listed in the lswhere output, ping the displayed Server Name from a command line, e.g.\n\n\n==========================\nping Machine_A\n========================== \n\n\nAn example of the resulting output is as follows:\n==========================\nUnknown host Machine_A\n========================== \n\n\nIf the ping command is unable to resolve the Server Name, you have a name resolution problem and must address it (with help from your IT Administrator/Help Desk team) before IBM SPSS Statistics/Modeler can acquire a license from the Sentinel License Manager.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Need more help?

releases of IBM HTTP Server (IHS) component in all editions of WebSphere Application Server and bundling products.\n\n\nREMEDIATION/FIXES\nThere is no separate interim fix for the PI27904 APAR that is associated with this issue, but the interim fix for APAR PI31516 (TLS Padding Vulnerability CVE-2014-8730 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21692502]) includes the update for APAR PI27904. APAR PI27904 update disables SSLv3 by default for IHS 7.0 and newer, and adds the 'SSLProtocolEnable' directive into IHS 7.0. \n\nThe update for PI27904 will be included in fix packs 7.0.0.37, 8.0.0.10 and 8.5.5.4. \n\n\nWORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS\nFor all releases and versions of Apache based IBM HTTP Server, IBM recommends disabling SSLv3: \n\n\nAdd the following directive to the httpd.conf file to disable SSLv3 and SSLv2 for each context that contains \"SSLEnable\":\n\n# Disable SSLv3 for CVE-2014-3566\n# SSLv2 is disabled in V8R0 and later by default, and in typical V7\n# and earlier configurations disabled implicitly when SSLv3 ciphers \n# are configured with SSLCipherSpec.\nSSLProtocolDisable SSLv3 SSLv2\n\nStop and restart IHS for the changes to take affect.\n\nNote: \n\n * If you start IHS with the -f command line argument, or you use the \"Include\" directive to include alternate configuration files, you may need to search those filenames for SSLEnable.\n\n * If you configure SSL with SSLEnable in the global (non-virtualhost) scope, you will need to move SSLEnable into a virtualhost scope to add SSLProtocolDisable\n\n\nIBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas that enable SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation (such as disabling SSLv3) and remediation actions.

This is not true.\n\nMany factors impact firmware upgrade capability and many are noted in other technical documents such as the Firmware upgrade fails with 'incompatible platform flash capacity' error [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21506678] document.\n\nThe appliance has three basic file systems:\n\n\n *  Encrypted Temporary Internal space. \n\nAll three are used during a firmware upgrade. \nNote: The 6.0.1 firmware is not supported on an 9235/9004 appliance as noted in the 6.0.1 firmware release information [http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=AN&subtype=CA&htmlfid=897/ENUS213-584&appname=lenovous&language=en].\n\n\nANSWER\n \n\nBefore taking any steps, free up as much file system space as possible. \n\n1. Check the available file system free space using one of the methods below:  *  Use the following CLI commands:\n   top;co;show filesystem Via the WebGUI, in the Default domain, go to Status > System > Filesystem Information. Deleting unused or unneeded files, configuration objects and domains frees Encrypted space. Rebooting frees Temporary space. \n\n2. Set up a custom log target to monitor upgrade actions:  *  If there are concerns about possible configuration loss, issues, or there is a need to track the uprade actions should anything go wrong, a \"management\" type of log target saved to logstore://<RaidVolume> or even to a remote syslog/UDP may help. Configure this log target in the default domain. This management log target should not be saved to logtemp:// as files in this directory are deleted on each reboot. The following technote [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21497973]helps give suggestions on how the log target should be configured. \n\n3. After freeing up as much space as possible, the general steps for upgrading are:  *  Stop all traffic to the appliance (such as removing from an load balancer, disable domains, etc.). Reboot the appliance to free all available resources. Take a backup of the appliance, see this technote [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21416135] for additional information Check for expired keys and certificates as expired ones are deleted automatically at upgrade time. Note: If any expired certificates are in use, the objects or services that use the expired certificates are in the down state after the upgrade. Upload the new firmware image. Perform the \u201cboot image\u201d. \n\n4. Failed upgrades:  *  NOTE: After any failed upgrade attempt, immediately reboot the appliance to free resources taken by the upgrade attempt. \n\n *  Failure update due to not enough space for the upgrade  1. If errors like the following are seen, there is not enough space available for the upgrade:  1. Insufficient flash space - not enough space for the upgrade to complete \n        2. Failed to preserve user data - not enough space to create the \u201crollback image\u201d\n       \n       \n    2. If there is not enough space for the upgrade, consider the following steps based on your scenario:  1. Upgrade skips major releases:  * Major releases are identified by the first three numbers of the image name such as 4.0.1, 4.0.2, 5.0.0 etc. If the current firmware is 4.0.1.x, trying to upgrade directly to 6.0.0.x which skips major releases requires additional space to create the rollback image. This is explained in the File System technote [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21496334], \n            * To use less space while upgrading several major releases, perform a \u201cstepped\u201d upgrade by upgrading to each major release between the current level and the 6.0.0.x firmware. For example, upgrade from the:  1. 4.0.1.x firmware to 4.0.2.x \n               2. 4.0.2.x firmware to 5.0.0.x \n               3. 5.0.0.x firmware to 6.0.0.x.\n              \n              \n           \n           \n        2. Upgrading only one major release such as 5.0.0.x to 6.0.0.x and not enough space:  * Upgrade using a \u201cbase\u201d (no licenses/features) level of the target firmware such as xi6004.scrypt2. If the upgrade is successful, perform an \u201cin place\u201d upgrade to a level with the required features. For example, if upgrading to the 6.0.0.4 firmware on an appliance that uses thee ODBC and TIBCO licenses, use the xi6004.scrypt2 to upgrade. After that upgrade completes, upgrade again using the xi6004.odbc.tibco.scrypt2 image. \n            * To check your licenses/features from the:  1. CLI issue, the \u201cshow license\u201d command. \n               2. WebGUI, go to Status-> System -> Device Features.\n              \n               * Note: If the upgrade is done using a \u201cbase\u201d level and the appliance has additional features, the features are shown as \u201cEnabled\u201d but not \u201cAvailable\u201d. After the \u201cin place\u201d upgrade,the features show as both \u201cEnabled\u201d and \u201cAvailable\u201d.\n              \n              \n           \n           \n        3. If still not enough space, consider doing one or more of the following:  * Delete additional application domains and once the upgrade is complete, restore the domains from the backup taken at the start. Note: There is no guarantee there is enough space after the upgrade to restore all the application domains. \n            * Delete the rollback image. When an upgrade is done, a rollback image is created that allows you to rollback to the last firmware you upgraded from. If you delete the rollback image, it is not possible to rollback to the earlier firmware. \n            * Reinitialize the appliance to the 6.0.0.x firmware then restore from you backup.\n              See this technote [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21244384&loc=en_US&cs=utf-8&lang=en] for details on the reinitialize to factory settings.\n           \n           \n       \n       \n   \n   \n\n *   * \n   \n   \n\nIf you are still having issues please Contact IBM Support [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21236322]. \n\nAdditional information: \nConnecting to the serial console [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21663613] \nSecure backup/restore [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/1009_furbee/1009_furbee.html] \nSecure restore [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/1006_majikes/1006_majikes.html] \nFix Central download site [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/] \nWebGUI fails after upgrade [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21498634]", "document_id": "swg21662595"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "\n\nWork with ILTM 9.2.7 / 9.5.4.38.

You can perform installation or upgrade tasks by using the Recovery media alone, or by upgrading to or installing HMC V8 over the network. (The recovery media are not always needed for network installation.)\n\nNOTE: For additional information, including enhancements, fixes and known issues with HMC Version 8 releases and for information on release specific upgrade instructions please review the release notes in the README on Fix Central [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral]. \n\nPREREQUISITE TASKS\n 1. Order the appropriate set of HMC V8 Recovery DVDs online from Fix Central [//www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral] (recommended). Alternately, you can download the ISO images for the HMC V8 Recovery package from Fix Central, and then create DVDs from these ISO images by using your favorite method to create DVDs.\n 2. The HMC V8 package consists of one Recovery DVD. It is highly recommended that you obtain this media from IBM. If you wish to download the ISO images and burn your own DVDs, please make sure high-quality, single-layer, DVD-R media is used. Do not use DVD+R or DVD-RW.\n 3. Review the following notes carefully:\n    Notes:\n     1. Because the HMC is a closed system, you cannot download the ISO file onto the HMC. There are no utilities available to burn DVD media on the HMC.\n     2. The size of these ISO file may be greater than 1 Gigabyte. If you are downloading the ISO files to a server, please make sure that the operating system can handle files of this size. For UNIX systems, use the ulimit command to check the file size limit, and then change it, if necessary. Do not use the browser on the HMC to download the file onto the HMC. The download and save functions on the HMC's browser are disabled.\n     3. You must perform a Save Upgrade Data task to preserve information on the HMC before upgrading to HMC V8. There is no Corrective Service to update the HMC to HMC V8 from any Version lower than HMC V8. You must upgrade immediately after the Save Upgrade Data task. If you restart the HMC again without doing the upgrade, you will need to log in and run the Save Upgrade Data task again, before you perform the Upgrade.\n    \n    \n\nUPGRADE THE HMC TO HMC V8 VIA RECOVERY MEDIA\nBefore you begin the upgrade task, read and follow the instructions in the Prerequisite tasks section.\n\nFollow these steps at the HMC interface to upgrade your HMC by means of the Recovery DVDs.\n\n 1.  Select HMC Management.\n 2.  Select Save Upgrade Data.\n 3.  Select media type USB flash drive, then click Next.\n 4.  Click Finish.\n 5.  Wait for the Save Upgrade Data task to complete. If the task fails, contact your next level of support before proceeding. Note: The Save Upgrade Data will be saved to the hard drive on the HMC as well as the USB flash drive. The Save Upgrade Data on the media is used only to recover from an unexpected error under the direction of support personnel.\n     \n     \n 6.  Once the Save Upgrade Data task is successful, remove the USB flash drive, insert the V8 Recovery DVD into the DVD-RAM drive, and then select Shutdown or Restart.\n 7.  Select Restart and click OK.\n 8.  Note: If the HMC fails to restart from optical drive, the boot manager may need to be called (in other words, press F12 during the boot process) in order to get the HMC to boot from the optical drive.\n 9.  The HMC reads the media in the DVD-RAM drive and displays the Hardware Management Console Install wizard window. Highlight Next button (use tab/alt-Tab or arrow keys to move), and press Space bar or Enter to select. \n 10. Note: If the Save Upgrade Data was not performed, you will see a warning window that save upgrade data was not found on the hard drive. Cancel the upgrade, remove the recovery media from the DVD drive, reboot the HMC, complete Save Upgrade Data task, then start the upgrade process again.\n 11. Using tab or arrow keys to move the cursor and space bar to select an option, select Upgrade to a new release (need asterisk on Upgrade to a new release as shown below):\n 12. \n     ( * ) Upgrade to a new release \n     ( ) Install \n     \n     Highlight Next button, and press Enter. \n 13. On Upgrade Confirmation screen, highlight Finish and press Enter to start the Upgrade process.\n 14. The HMC restores the data preserved by the Save Upgrade Data task, and then completes the booting process. During this process you are prompted to select the language and keyboard mapping.\n 15. At the Hardware Management Console login prompt, log in using your user id and password.\n 16. Accept the License Agreement for Machine Code twice to complete the HMC code update.\n\nVERIFYING A SUCCESSFUL UPDATE\nAfter the HMC is rebooted, follow these steps to verify that the HMC upgrade was successful: \n\n 1. Select Welcome from the Navigation panel. \n    \n 2. Point your mouse over the HMC Version link on the Content panel to display the Version information.\n 3. Verify the version information of the upgraded HMC 8 release in the appropriate Version 8 Readme online in Fix Central.\n\nBack to top\n\nINSTALLING HMC V8 VIA THE HMC V8 RECOVERY MEDIA\nBefore you begin the installation task, read and follow the instructions in the Prerequisite tasks section.\n\nYou can use the HMC V8 Recovery media to perform a full installation of HMC V8 via the \"Install from Media\" task. \n\nAt the HMC interface, follow these steps to perform a clean installation of your HMC from the Recovery DVDs.\n\n 1. Reboot your HMC with the V8 Recovery DVD inserted in the DVD RAM drive.\n 2. The HMC reads the media in the DVD-RAM drive and displays the Hardware Management Console Install wizard window. Highlight Next button (use tab/alt-Tab or arrow keys to move), and press Space bar or Enter to select. \n 3. Using tab or arrow keys to move the cursor and space bar to select an option, select Install (need asterisk on Install as shown below):\n 4. \n    ( ) Upgrade to a new version \n    ( * ) Install \n    \n    Highlight Next button, and press Enter. \n 5. The \u201cRestore critical console data from media (Install Only)\u201d option will be pre-selected. Navigate to \u201cFinish the installation without restoring data\u201d and press Space bar to select it. Navigate to Next and press Enter to continue.\n 6. \n    ( ) Restore critical console data from media (Install Only) \n    ( * ) Finish the installation without restoring data \n    \n 7. On the Install Confirmation screen, select Finish to start the Installation process. The install progress screen will be displayed. \n 8. Once the install process is complete, you will be prompted to select the locale and keyboard mapping, and finally accept the HMC license.\n\nVERIFYING A SUCCESSFUL UPDATE\nAfter the HMC is rebooted, follow these steps to verify that the HMC upgrade was successful: \n\n 1. Select Welcome from the Navigation panel. \n    \n 2. Point your mouse over the HMC Version link on the Content panel to display the Version information.\n 3. Verify the version information of the upgraded HMC 8 release in the appropriate Version 8 Readme online in Fix Central.\n\nBack to top\n\nUPGRADING/INSTALLING OVER A NETWORK\n Alternately, you can upgrade to HMC Version 8 over a network. The \"Special upgrade notes\" still apply, but when the specified conditions are met, you can then install over a network instead of using Recovery DVDs. The network install images for HMC Version 8, along with installation instructions, are available here:\n\n * Upgrading or installing an HMC V8 over a network [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1020108]\n * HMC network installation images download links (all versions) [http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/netinstall/home.html]\n\nBack to top", "document_id": "nas8N1020109"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Question: Is re-naming the WebSphere Portal installation directory and cell name for an existing clustered installation possible?

Is it safe to run MDM within 2 separate WAS cells, with both of them actively pointing to the same Database at run time? \n\nANSWER\n1. This is not certified by MDM to have two JMVs in one node. If you want to separate the work load between batch and real time, the batch JVM should not be in the same cluster, but can be on the same physical server as the existing JVM. \n2. You have to treat this as a new MDM installation and then re-pointing it back to the same database as the other cluster. Please refer to the steps here like an upgrade process:\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWSR9_11.0.0/com.ibm.swg.im.mdmhs.release.upgrade.doc/Topics/upgrademdmsdb.html?lang=en [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWSR9_11.0.0/com.ibm.swg.im.mdmhs.release.upgrade.doc/Topics/upgrademdmsdb.html?lang=en]\n3.

RES components that interact directly with the RES Console management stack normally expect to find exactly one RES Console within the this management scope : an error can arise from not finding a RES Console management stack, as well as finding more than one.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nCertain use cases are supported that involve deploying more than one RES console in a cluster, most notably for situations where a active/passive fail over is needed, see the following document for more information: Clustering Rule Execution Server (RES) management console [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21426014] \n\n\nHowever there is a number of limitations that one can face when several RES consoles are deployed within the same administrative cell, such as : \n\n 1. The use of the API ilog.rules.session.IlrManagementSession (reference [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/html/api/html/ilog/rules/res/session/IlrManagementSession.html]) may fail with a java.lang.IllegalStateException as per the symptom above. In this situation, the only option is to deploy a single RES Console per cell. \n 2. With JRules 6.x deploying RSM in a cell where more than one RES console is deployed can lead to java.lang.IllegalStateException as per the symptom above when attempting to add an SSP through the RSM console. \n 3. With JRules 7.x DVS scenario suite executions initiated from Rule Studio to be run on a remote Java EE server in a cell where more than one RES console is deployed may fail with java.lang.IllegalStateException as per the symptom above. \n 4. The use of interceptors (i.e. IlrSessionInterceptor implementations) may fail with a java.lang.IllegalStateException or an error message such as ilog.rules.res.session.interceptor.IlrSessionInterceptorException: Unable to find RuleApp /myruleapp/myruleset for use by the interceptor. In this situation, the only option is to deploy a single RES Console per cell.\n\n\nFor situations 2. and 3. note that DVS and RSM are normally deployed in a non-production environment since they support the testing process of the rules prior to their deployment to production. So in practice it is not necessary to deploy multiple RES console instances for fail over purpose when in a testing environment. The recommendation is then to set up RES console and SSP in a testing cell that is separate from the production cell. In this testing cell, only one instance of RES console should be installed.

So far everything is working fine. \n    \n 2. You manually changed the password for UserA in the LTPA (LDAP or custom registry) from Password1 to Password2. \n 3. Using a new browser we accessed the application providing UserA and the new password (Password2) a token was created and again everything is working as expected. \n    \n 4. Using a another new browser we accessed the application providing UserA and the old password (Password1). You were surprised to notice that a token was created and UserA was able to access the application. \n\n\nAnswer 2 \nThe old password takes up to 1.5 times the security cache to disappear. It will also expire at the end of the LTPA token timeout. \n\nIn IBM WebSphere Application Server V5.0.2 and later, you can purge a user from the security cache using an MBean interface.

If so, what mechanism should we use? \n\nAnswer 4\nYou can manually perform a form-based logout (as described in the Information Center) to request that the LTPAToken cookie be destroyed in the web browser, but within WebSphere Application Server, there is no functionality to automatically perform the form-based logout when the session times out.

Search the installation log for instances of the CheckLockedFiles string. Locked files are listed at these places. Locked files are files that might need to be upgraded during an installation, and because they are in use (locked) the silent install terminates.\n\n\n2. Identify the process that is locking the files.\n\n\n3. Stop the process.\n\n\n4. Prevent file locking by modifying the response file for installation file. This step is required when a silent installation has terminated. \n\na. Open the response file in a text editor. In many cases, the file in which you make this modification is named silent.txt. On Windows, the file to modify is the NT_Silent_Install.txt file that is located on the monitoring server.\nb. Add the following line to the [INSTALLATION SECTION] area of your silent install response file:\nLocked Files=continue\nIf you apply any other value or assign no value for this parameter, silent installations fail when locked files exist.\nc. If Locked Files=continue is used in a silent install or remote deploy, the computer MUST be rebooted before ITM is brought up or another install is run. This is mandatory or the <ITMHOME> directory could become corrupt. If the <ITMHOME> directory becomes corrupt, all of ITM will have to be uninstalled and reinstalled.\n\n\n5.

If no\n      additional properties are required (i.e. the list of\n      name-value pairs is empty), then the ? is omitted from the\n      URI.\n   \n   More information about the format of the URI used by the\n   JMSReplyTo field, and details of the name-value pairs that can\n   be used, can be found in the \"Sending a message\" section of the\n   \"Writing WebSphere MQ JMS applications\" chapter in the\n   WebSphere MQ \"Using Java\" manual\n   (http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv6/v6r0/index.jsp?\n   topic=/com.ibm.mq.csqzaw.doc/uj24420_.htm)\n   \n   This change has implications when messages for JMS applications\n   are sent to Queue destinations from non-JMS clients.\n   \n   When the JMS application picks up the message, the JMSReplyTo\n   field will, by default, look like this:\n   \n     queue://<qmgrName>/<queueName>?targetClient=1\n   \n   The ?targetClient=1 value tells the WebSphere MQ classes for\n   JMS not to include an RFH2 header in any reply, as they are\n   being sent to a non-JMS application.\n   \n   To prevent the ?targetClient=1 value from appearing at the end\n   of the JMSReplyTo  field, the connection factory object used by\n   the JMS application should have the TARGCLIENTMATCHING property\n   set to NO.\n   \n   \n   In addition, the \"Mapping JMS messages onto WebSphere MQ\n   messages\" section of the \"Using Java\" manual also needs to be\n   updated to include the following information:\n   \n   Mapping JMS messages onto WebSphere MQ messages\n   -----------------------------------------------\n   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :\n   WebSphere MQ messages are composed of three components:\n   \n     - The WebSphere MQ Message Descriptor (MQMD)\n     - A WebSphere MQ MQRFH2 header\n     - The message body\n   \n   The MQRFH2 is optional, and its inclusion in an outgoing\n   message is governed by the TARGCLIENT property for the JMS\n   Destination that the message is being sent to. This property\n   has two possible values:\n   \n     - JMS\n       The message is being sent to is a JMS application, so an\n       MQRFH2 header will be included.\n     - MQ\n       The outgoing message is being sent to a non-JMS WebSphere\n       MQ application, so the MQRFH2 will not be included.\n   \n   Because the MQRFH2 carries JMS-specific information, always\n   include it in the outgoing message when the sender knows that\n   the receiving destination is also a JMS application.  Normally,\n   omit the MQRFH2 when sending a message directly to a non-JMS\n   application.  This is because such an application does not\n   expect an MQRFH2 in its WebSphere MQ message.\n   \n   If an incoming message does not have an MQRFH2 header, the\n   JMSReplyTo header field of the message will look like this:\n   \n     queue://<qmgrName>/<queueName>?targetClient=1\n   \n   and the Queue or Topic object derived from this field will have\n   the TARGCLIENT property set to MQ, so that a reply message sent\n   to the queue or topic also does not have an MQRFH2 header.\n   \n   It is also possible to switch off the behaviour of\n   automatically including an MQRFH2 header in a reply message if\n   the original message has an MQRFH2 header.  To do this, the\n   TARGCLIENTMATCHING property of the connection factory used by\n   the sending application should be set to the value NO.\n   \n   Setting TARGCLIENTMATCHING to NO also has an effect on the\n   JMSReplyTo field of an incoming message. If the application\n   receiving the message is using a connection factory that has\n   the TARGCLIENTMATCHING property set to NO, the JMSReplyTo field\n   will look like this:\n   \n     queue://<qmgrName>/<queueName>\n   \n   Figure 2 shows how the structure of a JMS message is\n   transformed to a WebSphere MQ message and back again.\n   \n   ---------------------------------------------------------------\n   The fix is targeted for delivery in the following PTFs:\n   \n   The latest available maintenance can be obtained from\n   'Websphere MQ Recommended Fixes'\n   http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006037 [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006037]\n   \n   If the maintenance level is not yet available, information on\n   its planned availability can be found in 'Websphere MQ\n   Planned Maintenance Release Dates'\n   http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006309 [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006309]\n   ---------------------------------------------------------------\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nTEMPORARY FIX\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nAPAR INFORMATION\n * APAR NUMBER\n   IC59404\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT NAME\n   WMQ WINDOWS V6\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT ID\n   5724H7200\n   \n   \n * REPORTED RELEASE\n   600\n   \n   \n * STATUS\n   CLOSED DOC\n   \n   \n * PE\n   NoPE\n   \n   \n * HIPER\n   NoHIPER\n   \n   \n * SPECIAL ATTENTION\n   NoSpecatt\n   \n   \n * SUBMITTED DATE\n   2009-01-08\n   \n   \n * CLOSED DATE\n   2009-02-27\n   \n   \n * LAST MODIFIED DATE\n   2009-02-27\n   \n   \n\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED FROM ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n * APAR IS SYSROUTED TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n\nFIX INFORMATION\n\nAPPLICABLE COMPONENT LEVELS", "document_id": "swg1IC59404"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I need to understand details regarding Security Bulletin: A security vulnerability has been identified in WebSphere Application Server shipped with WebSphere Service Registry and Repository (CVE-2017-1681).

No additional software beyond z/OS is required. CICS TS talks indirectly through TCP/IP Telnet to print to a TCP/IP attached printer (or a TCP/IP attached PCOM terminal.) The printer communicates with TCP/IP Telnet so CICS sends the printout to the Telnet LU and the TCP/IP Telnet passes it on to the printer.\n\nTherefore, you should define the printer as a regular VTAM LU just like you did when using SNA, except the LU name will be one of the LUs in the pool of TCP/IP Telnet LUs. CICS does not know that it is communicating to a TCP/IP attached printer. It does not even know it is talking to TCP/IP Telnet. To CICS, it is just a VTAM luname. See Associated Printer Function in section 2.2.1.4.12 Advanced LU name mapping topics [http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr_OS390/BOOKS/F1A1B3B1/2.2.1.4.12?SHELF=f1a1bkd1&DT=20120119110606] of the z/OS V1.13 Communications Server: IP Configuration Guide (SC31-8775-20) for more information on how to define the printer.\n\nPrinting to a TCP/IP attached printer can also be accomplished by using printing software. If, for example, you use the IBM Infoprint Server [http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr_OS390/BOOKS/AOPI0350/1.0?SHELF=aopbk382&DT=20110613184121] printing software you could use NetSpool [http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr_OS390/BOOKS/AOPI0350/3.4?SHELF=aopbk382&DT=20110613184121] to simulate a VTAM printer and write the printing output to the MVS job entry system (JES) SPOOL. Then you could use IP PrintWay [http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr_OS390/BOOKS/AOPI0350/3.5?SHELF=aopbk382&DT=20110613184121] product to send the print output from the SPOOL to the TCP/IP printer.\n\nNetSpool and IP PrintWay perform complementary functions. NetSpool converts print requests from VTAM applications into S/390 line data and creates output data sets on the JES spool, using information in a NetSpool print-characteristics data set created by the installation. IP PrintWay can transmit data sets created by NetSpool from the JES spool to printers in a TCP/IP network.\n\n\n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n CICS/TS CICS TS CICS Transaction Server", "document_id": "swg21380385"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What does the message \"ERROR: Records trailing spring space set to 512 is too small...\" mean?

As the query is being processed the system allocates memory for each row of the result set. This includes each of the GROUP BY columns and each of the aggregates. For queries doing aggregates on variable length columns, the total length of the record will vary during the process. For example, if the current min value is \"Boston\" and the new min value is \"Albuquerque\" space for the new min value needs to increase. \n\nThe NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE is an extra pseudo-column that is tacked onto each row. It does not contain any data. It is a filler that starts out at NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE and then dynamically shrinks and expands as needed to keep each of the aggregate rows at a fixed length. There is a single springfield in each grouping record that has to shrink and grow to offset the combined changes in width of the running values for all min/max aggregates. \n\nTo avoid this error message, increase the value for this parameter as follows: \n\n1. nzstop\n2. export NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE=1024\n3. nzstart \n\nYou can confirm that the environment variable took effect by running the command \"nzsystem showregistry\". The output should contain the following: \"system.maxSpringFieldSize = 1024\". \n\nUnfortunately, the setting for NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE will revert to its default value the next time the database is stopped and started without the NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE environment variable being set. To ensure that the setting persists after every database restart, do the following:\n1. Add the following line to the /nz/data/config/system.cfg file. (Create the file if it does not exist.) \n\nsystem.maxSpringFieldSize = 1024\n2. nzstop\n3. nzstart \n\nIf 1024 does not work, try higher values. Setting the limit may take a little trial and error. Increasing this value should not have a noticeable impact on other system performance. \n\n \n\nNote: \"By default 512 bytes is allocated to each row taking part in aggregations. By increasing this value by 512 we allocate over 30MB more memory for every 1 000 000 rows participating in aggregations. This is for one query, there might be other queries in the system which do aggregations as well. The more memory that is allocated for NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE (for each row) the less memory left for other processes. Having said this, it is not uncommon to see NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE set to 8192 without consequence but care must be taken and one must still be aware of how increasing NZ_SPRINGFIELD_SIZE will impact resources, thus increase it wisely. \" \n\n \n\nHISTORICAL NUMBER\n NZ755310", "document_id": "swg21567862"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What can be done about \"Too many open files\" messages in the DASH systemOut log on a system running Linux?

MSGCPF3797 arises from a network of related files that contain too many internal objects for Load/Dump to handle in a single request.\n\nSome actions that may circumvent these errors are as follows: \n\no Display the library on which the save fails. The process of calculating the size of the files may set a bit in some files that will allow subsequent save operations to work.\nDSPLIB OUTPUT(*PRINT)\n- V6R1 or later o Create a data area that instructs save operations to use a large internal work area.\nCRTDTAARA DTAARA(QSYS/QDBSR256M) TYPE(*CHAR) LEN(1)\n- V7R1 or later, V6R1 with SI31317, V5R4 with SI31316 o Remove some files or members. For example:\n\n- Delete unnecessary files or members.\n- Move some members to another file.\n- Move some files to another library.\n- Archive some files or members. o Use ACCPTH(*NO) on the save command. \n- If this works, it should not be a long term solution. However, it is useful if a good backup is needed urgently, or to collect the customer data for lab analysis. o Split the save operation up into multiple save operations so only a portion of the library is saved in each save operation (for example, SAVOBJ OBJ(A* B* C*, and so on). o Use a different value for the SAVACT parameter.\n- V5R2 or earlier only o For SAVACT(*SYSDFN), use different journals for unrelated files.\n- V5R2 or earlier only Additional detail regarding CPF375E and CPF3797 \n\nMessage CPF375E occurs because an internal object limit has been exceeded for the Save/Restore Descriptor. At R520 and earlier, this error may be issued when using the SAVACT(*SYSDFN) parameter. This error may also be encountered at all releases when ACCPTH(*YES) parameter is specified. The SAVACT(*SYSDFN) parameter usually causes a problem when the user is using only one journal. In this case, all files journaled to that journal are networked together. This network can include many files from libraries other than what was specified in the save command, which causes too much information to go into the Save/Restore Descriptor. When SAVACT(*LIB) is used, the system is concerned only about the objects in the library specified; therefore, the network does not get so large. \n\nAnother parameter that causes problems with the Save/Restore Descriptor is when ACCPTH(*YES) is used. ACCPTH(*YES) causes more information to be built into the Save/Restore Descriptor. ACCPTH(*NO) allows the save to complete, but any subsequent restore takes much longer because all access paths must be rebuilt. Specifying ACCPTH(*NO) should not be a long term solution, but it is useful if a good backup is needed urgently. \n\nIf the CPF375E message continues to be sent from component DB, it is possible the user is trying to save too many objects. This scenario ties itself into message CPF3797, where the save command generates more internal dump operations than are allowed by the system. This is the case where the library has too many internal objects, and a system limit has been reached. \n\nFor information about the CPF3797 limit and estimating the number of internal objects, see the Save and restore limits in the Maximum Capacities information for the corresponding release. \n\nR730 Maximum Capacities: \nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_ibm_i_73/rzamp/rzampoverview.htm [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_ibm_i_73/rzamp/rzampoverview.htm] \nR720 Maximum Capacities: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_ibm_i_72/rzamp/rzampoverview.htm?lang=en [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_ibm_i_72/rzamp/rzampoverview.htm?lang=en] \nR710 Maximum Capacities: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_ibm_i_71/rzamp/rzampoverview.htm [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_ibm_i_71/rzamp/rzampoverview.htm] \nR610 Maximum Capacities: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_ibm_i_61/rzamp/rzampoverview.htm?lang=en [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_ibm_i_61/rzamp/rzampoverview.htm?lang=en] \nR540 Maximum Capacities: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_i5_54/rzamp/rzampoverview.htm?lang=en [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_i5_54/rzamp/rzampoverview.htm?lang=en]  \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Operating System IBM i 7.2 Operating System IBM i 7.1 Operating System IBM i 6.1 Operating System IBM i 7.3 \nHISTORICAL NUMBER\n 399881086", "document_id": "nas8N1015198"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Steps:\r\nI have two different user repositories one to manage my base portal and Virtual Portals.

This technote will provide 3 solutions to allow the inclusion of external elements into the build. \n\n\nSolution 1 - Use Component File element \n\n * \n * \n * Add source file to the build\n * \n\n\nSolution 2 - Use File/Class element \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Note:\n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  Add a Class/File element to map the external source code into the model. Set property CG::Class::UseAsExternal as \"checked\" for the added element. Set property CG::File::AddToMakefile [File::AddToMakefile] as \"checked\". Set the path to the external file in property CG::Class:FileName to make Rhapsody aware the location of the external source code. The path info would be used in MakeFile generated by Rhapsody.\n   \n   Note: Both absolute and relative path are supported. Right click the model element, from context menu, click Add New > SourceArtifact.\n   \n   Note: In order to include this external model element into MakeFile, SourceArtifact is required for the external model element. To enable the display of SourceArtifact, make sure Top Menu > View > Browser Display Options > Show Source Artifacts is checked.\n   Make sure the type of added SourceArtifact is set either \"Logical\" or \"Implementation\" (DO NOT choose \"Specification\"). \n   Rename SourceArtifact with the name of the external source code (e.g. rename the element to \"hoo\", if the external file name is \"hoo.cpp\"). Click [Elements] tab of the SourceArtifact to make sure the model element is correctly mapped in SourceArtifact. In case of Class, the mapping will be done automatically. For File, manually add its parent element to [Elements] tab as below:\n   \n   [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21621937&amp;aid=1]\n   \n   IMPORTANT: You might occasionally find the behavior of File is not consistent with Class. This is because File element is designed to be used as external element only, and not supposed to be built from Rhapsody. You are encouraged to use external Class element in RiC++ model to avoid any confusion you might experience. Generate MakeFile to make sure the external source file (e.g. hoo.obj) file is being added in the build.\n   \n\nSolution 3 - Use Additional Sources setting \n\n * \n * \n * [Additional Sources]\n * \n * [Settings]\n * \n *  \n   \n   Note: \n * \n\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n#Code generation for external elements [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/rhaphlp/v8/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.rhp.uml.diagrams.doc%2Ftopics%2Frhp_r_dm_cd_genrtion_extnl_elmts.html]\nAdd source file to the biuld [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/rhaphlp/v8/topic/com.ibm.rhp.uml.diagrams.doc/topics/rhp_t_dm_adding_source_files_build.html?resultof=%22%61%64%64%22%20%22%73%6f%75%72%63%65%22%20%22%73%6f%75%72%63%22%20%22%66%69%6c%65%22%20%22%62%75%69%6c%64%22%20]", "document_id": "swg21621937"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I need to understand details regarding GNU C library (glibc) vulnerability affects IBM DataPower Gateway appliances (CVE-2015-0235).

The runtime rules engine can come from the WebSphere Operational Decision Management (WODM). The node receives a input message, extracts the rule set parameter and then runs the rule engine. The result is sent to the output terminal and can be used for complex routing and decision making. \n\nThe SupportPac makes existing custom integrations between WebSphere Message Broker and WebSphere Operational Decision Management simpler to implement.\n\nThe SupportPac is delivered as a User Defined Node added to the Message Broker Toolkit palette. \n\u2022 WebSphere Message Broker v7, v8, v9 with IAM9 node v1 SupportPac with ODM v7, v7.5 and v8.\n\u2022 WebSphere Message Broker v7, v8, v9 with IAM9 node v2 SupportPac with ODM V8.0.1 and 8.5.\n\nPossible Uses\nDecision Service node can be used for:\n\u2022 Complex flow decisions by rule.\n\u2022 Content based routing by rule.\n\nNew in this Release\n\u2022 Provide a node implementation for all ODM releases currently available.\n\u2022 Change the user interface and input to look similar to the decision service node of IBM Integration Bus (formerly known as WebSphere Message Broker) v9.\n\u2022 Enable Decision Warehouse.\n\u2022 Provide Local Environment Structure to set rule set path and rule set parameters.\n\nDetails\nAuthor: Jochen Benke, IT Specialist, Software Services for WebSphere (ISSW)\nCategory: 2\nReleased: 27Mar12 \nLast updated: 28Aug13\nCurrent SupportPac Version: 2.0\n\u00bbPlease note that the version number shown in the right-hand pane is the version of the WebSphere MQ or WebSphere MB product that this SupportPac applies to.

Back to top\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n\nReview the output from mqjavalist.sh to determine where copies of the MQ jar files have been found. Not all duplicates represent a problem, unless they are being loaded by your Java SE application or Java EE application server at runtime. If the com.ibm.mq.commonservices.jar file shows an implementation version of ${version.number} - ${build.level} just ignore it.\n\nIn the sample output above, entries #16 through #27 represent the jar files for the installed MQ Resource Adapter. They all show an implementation version of 7.1.0.0 - k000-L111005.1 except for #21, com.ibm.mqjms.jar, which shows an implementation version of 7.0.1.5 - k701-105-110419. Because the jar file versions are not in sync, MQ JMS will not function as expected.\n\nIn cases like this, the wmq.jmsra.rar file should contain a copy of the MQ jar at the right level for the application server. Entry #14 in the mqjavalist.sh output shows the com.ibm.mqjms.jar file with an implementation version of 7.1.0.0 - k000-L111005.1, which is what we need. Use the jar program to extract the com.ibm.mqjms.jar file from the wmq.jmsra.rar archive, then copy it over the back-level version of the jar. Use chown and chmod to ensure the permissions on the file are correct.\n\nIn other cases, you might find that the classpath for the application server, or for your Java SE application, is picking up extra copies of the MQ jar files. Eliminating unnecessary classpath entries can resolve the problem.\n\nIf your Java EE application (.ear or .war) bundles a copy of any MQ jar files, you should remove them and rely on the ones from the installed MQ Resource Adapter instead.\n\nBack to top\n\n\nAdditional Keywords: \ntroubleshoot troubleshooting trouble shoot classloader classpath configuration scripts\n\n\n\nDOWNLOAD\n 1. \n 2. mqjavalist.sh [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21681142&amp;aid=2]mqjavalist.sh\n\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: All source code and/or binaries attached to this document are referred to here as \"the Program\".

This can happen for many reasons, including: \n\n * The application tries to get a connection and fails, as when the database is not started.\n   \n   \n * A connection is no longer usable due to a database failure. When an application tries to use a connection it has previously obtained, the connection is no longer valid. In this case, all connections currently in use by an application can get this error when they try to use the connection.\n   \n   \n * The application using the connection has already called close() and then tries to use the connection again.\n   \n   \n * The application tries to use a JDBC\u2122 resource, such as a statement, obtained on a now-stale connection.\n\n\nWhen the StaleConnectionException is issued, the behavior is determined by the Purge Policy setting for the connection pool. If the Purge Policy is set to EntirePool, the entire pool is flushed. But if the Purge Policy is set to FailingConnectionOnly, only the connection that caused the StaleConnectionException is purged from the pool. \n\nAn application can recover from bad connections by explicitly catching the StaleConnectionException and getting a new connection from the pool. Numerous exceptions issued by DB2, Oracle, DataDirect (for connecting to SQLServer), Sybase, and Informix are currently mapped to the StaleConnectionException, which makes recovery easier for the application programmer. The following pseudocode provides an example of how to recover from a StaleConnectionException: \n\n//get a userTransaction\njavax.transaction.UserTransaction tran = getSessionContext().getUserTransaction();\n//retry indicates whether to retry or not\n//numOfRetries states how many retries have\n// been attempted\nboolean retry = false;\nint numOfRetries = 0;\njava.sql.Connection conn = null;\njava.sql.Statement stmt = null;\ndo {\ntry {\n//begin a transaction\ntran.begin();\n//Assumes that a datasource has already been obtained\n//from JNDI\nconn = ds.getConnection();\nconn.setAutoCommit(false);\nstmt = conn.createStatement();\nstmt.execute(\"INSERT INTO EMPLOYEES VALUES\n(0101, 'Bill', 'R', 'Smith')\");\ntran.commit();\nretry = false;\n} catch(java.sql.SQLException sqlX)\n{\n// If the error indicates the connection is stale, then\n// rollback and retry the action\nif (com.ibm.websphere.rsadapter.WSCallHelper\n.getDataStoreHelper(ds)\n.isConnectionError(sqlX))\n{\ntry {\ntran.rollback();\n} catch (java.lang.Exception e) {\n//deal with exception\n//in most cases, this can be ignored\n}\nif (numOfRetries < 2) {\nretry = true;\nnumOfRetries++;\n} else {\nretry = false;\n}\n}\nelse\n{\n//deal with other database exception\nretry = false\n}\n} finally {\n//always cleanup JDBC resources\ntry {\nif(stmt != null) stmt.close();\n} catch (java.sql.SQLException sqle) {\n//usually can ignore\n}\ntry {\nif(conn != null) conn.close();\n} catch (java.sql.SQLException sqle) {\n//usually can ignore\n}\n}\n} while (retry) ;  \n\nFurther details about WebSphere Connection Pooling are located in the WebSphere Application Server Knowledge Center article Connection pooling [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/cdat_conpool.html]\n\nKnowledge Center article Exceptions pertaining to data access [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/cdat_daexcp.html] contains details on the StaleConnectionException error\n\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers Runtimes for Java Technology Java SDK", "document_id": "swg21063645"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I need to understand details regarding \"Security Bulletin: IBM PureApplication System is affected by a security vulnerability (CVE-2015-1890)\".

Save the current configuration.  * From the WebGUI, click Save Config. \n     * From the command line, issue the write memory command. \n    \n    \n 3. Create a backup of the entire system, and store the configuration in a safe location off of the appliance. \n 4. Confirm that you have a working admin account and a back up privileged account that can change the password for the admin account, if needed. \n 5. Make sure that the passwords for both accounts were recently changed.\n\n\nPart 4: Installing the firmware image. \nInstall the firmware image. Each firmware image uses the serial number of the appliance as the key. \n 1. Remove appliance from production. \n 2. Following the instructions upgrade documentation in the information center:  * Remove extraneous files \n     * Reboot the appliance to release temporary storage \n     * Transfer the firmware image to the appliance \n     * Install the firmware image\n    \n    \n 3. Verify that the appliance has the Application Optimization feature.  * From the WebGUI, click Status -> System -> Device Features. The list includes:  * Option for Application Optimization support\n       \n       \n     * From the command line, issue the show features command. The list includes:  * AppOpt\n       \n       \n    \n    \n\n\nIf the installation is successful and the list does not include the Application Optimization feature, the most likely reason is that the firmware image was for a different appliance. Each firmware image to add the Application Optimization feature uses the serial number of the appliance as the key. If you install a downloaded image to a different appliance, you will notice that the firmware is upgraded to that firmware level and that the Application for Optimization feature is not available. \n\nIf you accessed the download site using the Controlled Access Key and installed the downloaded image to the appliance with the matching serial number and the feature list does not include the Application Optimization feature, contact IBM Support [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21236322]. \n\nContacting IBM Support \nWhen reporting the problem to IBM Support, the representative will need your Controlled Access Key in addition to the standard information to include.

Intermittently, the WAS MDB application will do an MQGET for a message and will receive a message with the same correlid two times. \n\nCAUSE\nThe problem is related to the message ID of the received messages. To explain what is happening requires an understanding of how WAS and the JMS client supply messages to Message Driven Beans. \n\nWhen a MDB is deployed, the application server will use part of the JMS specification known as the Application Server Facilities (ASF). As part of the ASF setup, the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS (the JMS client code) will create a thread that will browse the message queue for messages that can be dispatched to the MDB. \n\nThe implementation of the ASF classes is in two parts. As stated previously, there is a thread that will browse the message queue looking for suitable messages. The second part of the ASF implementation is within the JMS Session object and performs the actual destructive get of the messages from the queue, and passes the received messages to the MDB code. The browsing thread passes a MessageReference containing details of the message to a JMS Session, which is then run on a new thread, and this Session uses the MessageReference to perform the destructive get of the message from the queue (in whatever transactional context is required). \n\nWhen the Session performs the destructive get, it uses the MessageID to ensure that the correct message is retrieved from the queue. It is for this reason that the ASF implementation of the JMS client code requires that messages each have different MessageIds. When a message is put to a Queue or Topic by JMS, a new MessageID is assigned to the message at put time; there is no way within JMS to override this and avoid setting a MessageID. However, if a non-JMS application is used to put the original message then it is possible to put that message without a suitable, unique, MessageId being set.\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nWe can see in the trace, a number of consume() calls, in which the Session will perform the get of the message. Each consume traces out the MessageId and CorrelationId of the message to be retrieved, and, although the CorrelationId of each message appears to be different, in every case, the MessageId is stated to be \"404040404040404040404040404040404040404040404040\" (as a hex representation of the byte values). \n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nEnsure that the original putting application sets a unique MessageId or uses the appropriate putMessageOptions (MQPMO_NEW_MSG_ID) to ensure that the queue manager creates a new MessageId for each message that is put to the queue.\n\n \n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n wmq/mq", "document_id": "swg21446754"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I need to understand details regarding Security Bulletin: Multiple vulnerabilities in IBM Java Runtime affect API Connect ( CVE-2016-5548).

In some cases IBM Rational ClearCase client components using OpenSSL might be affected. The vulnerability could allow a malicious server to expose private memory of the client. ClearCase has no affected server components. \n\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\n \n\nSubscribe to My Notifications to be notified of important product support alerts like this.  * Follow this link [https://www.ibm.com/systems/support/myview/subscription/css.wss/subscriptions?methodName=startSearchToSubscribe&uctug_rational_dcfsbblurb_2013-11-05_myn_adoption_promo] for more information (requires login with your IBM ID)\n\nCVE-ID: CVE-2014-0160 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160] [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4353] \n\nDescription: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the TLS/DTLS heartbeat functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose 64k of private memory and retrieve secret keys. An attacker can repeatedly expose additional 64k chunks of memory. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. It can be exploited on any system (i.e. server, client, agent) receiving connections using the vulnerable OpenSSL library. \n\nCVSS Base Score: 5\nCVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92322 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/92322]\nCVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined\nCVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)\n\nWarning: It is strongly encouraged that you take action as soon as possible as potential implications to your environment may be more serious than indicated by the CVSS score.\n\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS\nIBM Rational ClearCase versions: \n\n * 7.1.2 through 7.1.2.13 \n * 8.0 through 8.0.0.10 \n * 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.3\n\n\nNote: Versions earlier than 7.1.2 are not affected. \n\nNot all deployments of Rational ClearCase use OpenSSL in a way that is affected by these vulnerabilities. \n\nYou are vulnerable if your use of Rational ClearCase includes any of these configurations: \n * You use the base ClearCase/ClearQuest integration client on any platform, configured to use SSL to communicate with a ClearQuest server. The perl interpreter running the integration scripts is vulnerable to a malicious server (or an attacker intercepting connections to a server).\n   \n   \n * You use the UCM/ClearQuest integration on UNIX/Linux clients, configured to use SSL to communicate with a ClearQuest server. The client is vulnerable to a malicious server (or an attacker intercepting connections to a server). \n   \n   Note: Windows clients using the UCM/ClearQuest integration are not vulnerable.\n   \n   \n * You use the Change Management Integrations for base ClearCase with ClearQuest or Rational Team Concert (RTC), or for UCM with ClearQuest or RTC on UNIX/Linux clients, configured to use SSL to communicate with a ClearQuest or RTC server. The client is vulnerable to a malicious server (or an attacker intercepting connections to a server). \n   \n   Note: Windows clients using the CMI integration are not vulnerable.\n   \n   \n * You use ratlperl, ccperl, or cqperl to run your own perl scripts, and those scripts use SSL connections. The perl interpreter is vulnerable to attacks by a malicious network peer.\n\nREMEDIATION/FIXES\nApply an interim fix for your appropriate release of ClearCase. These versions include OpenSSL 1.0.1g. \n\n\n * 7.1.2.x: Install Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 13 (7.1.2.13) for 7.1.2 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24036979] plus Interim fix 1 (7.1.2.13.01) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037380]\n   \n   \n * 8.0.0.x: Install Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 10 (8.0.0.10) for 8.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24036981] plus Interim fix 1 (8.0.0.10.01) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037382]\n   \n   \n * 8.0.1.x: Install Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 3 (8.0.1.3) for 8.0.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24036983] plus Interim fix 1 for (8.0.1.03.01) [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037384]\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the fix, additional instructions are needed for CVE-2014-0160. \n\n \n\n 1. Replace your SSL Certificates\n    \n    You need to revoke existing SSL certificates and reissue new certificates. You need to be sure not to generate the new certificates using the old private key and create a new private key (using \"openssl genrsa\") and use that new private key to create the new certificate signing request (CSR). \n    \n    \n 2. Reset User Credentials\n    \n    Users of network facing applications protected by a vulnerable version of OpenSSL should be forced to reset their passwords and should revoke any authentication or session related cookies set prior to the time OpenSSL was upgraded and force the user to re-authenticate.\n\n\n\nWarning: Your environment may require additional fixes for other products, including non-IBM products. Please replace the SSL certificates and reset the user credentials after applying the necessary fixes to your environment. WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS\nDisable the ClearCase/ClearQuest integration and any customized defined use of ratlperl, ccperl, or cqperl with SSL until you apply the fixes listed above.\n\nGET NOTIFIED ABOUT FUTURE SECURITY BULLETINS\n Subscribe to My Notifications [ http://www-01.ibm.com/software/support/einfo.html] to be notified of important product support alerts like this. \n\nREFERENCES\nComplete CVSS v2 Guide [http://www.first.org/cvss/v2/guide] \nOn-line Calculator v2 [http://nvd.nist.gov/CVSS-v2-Calculator] \n\nRELATED INFORMATION\nIBM Secure Engineering Web Portal [http://www.ibm.com/security/secure-engineering/bulletins.html] \nIBM Product Security Incident Response Blog [http://www.ibm.com/blogs/psirt] \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nNone \n\nCHANGE HISTORY\n * 22 April 2014: Original copy published\n* 28 May 2014: noted version of OpenSSL \n\n*The CVSS Environment Score is customer environment specific and will ultimately impact the Overall CVSS Score.

The following FDCs are dumped\n   with Probe ID's:-\n   XY030011 out of xllListenSelectAcceptAndClose\n   XY031021 out of xllSelectAcceptAndClose\n   The function stack in the FDC shows:\n      xllListenSelectAcceptAndClose rc=STOP\n   This STOP return code is improperly handled, leading to a hang.\n   \n   Once this failure occurs the entire queue manager hangs and\n   there is no response to any MQ commands.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nLOCAL FIX\n\nPROBLEM SUMMARY\n *  ****************************************************************\n   USERS AFFECTED:\n   Users of MQ 5.3 and 6.0 where there is a hard limit of 1024 file\n   descriptors (FD_SETSIZE), or where a select on a file descriptor\n   may fail.\n   \n   Platforms affected:\n   AIX,HP-UX (Itanium),HP-UX (PA-RISC),Linux (Power),Linux (s390x),\n   Linux (x86),Linux (x86-64),Linux (zSeries)\n   \n   ****************************************************************\n   PROBLEM SUMMARY:\n   This problem is seen on platforms which have a hard limit of\n   1024 file descriptors(FD_SETSIZE) limit. If applications\n   reach this limit, a select failure results and then the queue\n   manager will hang.\n   \n   Also if for any reason if select fails in\n   xllListenSelectAcceptAndClose() then this problem can be seen.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\n *  When an application under heavy load hits a hard limit\n   for select of 1024 file descriptors (the FD_SETSIZE ) the\n   select fails and returns an RC=STOP to\n   xllListenSelectAcceptAndClose call. Before calling\n   xllListenSelectAcceptAndClose a lock would have been acquired,\n   but the lock was not released when RC=STOP was returned,\n   resulting in a queue manager hang. This APAR ensures the lock is\n   released to avoid the hang.\n   \n   ---------------------------------------------------------------\n   The fix is targeted for delivery in the following PTFs:\n   \n                      v5.3\n   Platform           Fix Pack 14\n   --------           --------------------\n   AIX                U808477\n   HP-UX (PA-RISC)    U808478\n   Linux (x86)        U808481\n   Linux (zSeries)    U808483\n   \n                      v6.0\n   Platform           Fix Pack 6.0.2.3\n   --------           --------------------\n   AIX                U811346\n   HP-UX (PA-RISC)    U811630\n   HP-UX (Itanium)    U811631\n   Linux (x86)        U811634\n   Linux (x86-64)     U811635\n   Linux (zSeries)    U811636\n   Linux (Power)      U811637\n   Linux (s390x)      U811638\n   \n   The latest available maintenance can be obtained from\n   'WebSphere MQ Recommended Fixes'\n   http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006037 [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006037]\n   \n   If the maintenance level is not yet available, information on\n   its planned availability can be found in 'WebSphere MQ\n   Planned Maintenance Release Dates'\n   http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006309 [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006309]\n   ---------------------------------------------------------------\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nTEMPORARY FIX\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nAPAR INFORMATION\n * APAR NUMBER\n   IY98777\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT NAME\n   WEBS MQ FOR LIN\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT ID\n   5724B4105\n   \n   \n * REPORTED RELEASE\n   530\n   \n   \n * STATUS\n   CLOSED PER\n   \n   \n * PE\n   NoPE\n   \n   \n * HIPER\n   NoHIPER\n   \n   \n * SPECIAL ATTENTION\n   NoSpecatt\n   \n   \n * SUBMITTED DATE\n   2007-05-18\n   \n   \n * CLOSED DATE\n   2007-08-14\n   \n   \n * LAST MODIFIED DATE\n   2007-08-28\n   \n   \n\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED FROM ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n * APAR IS SYSROUTED TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n\nFIX INFORMATION\n * FIXED COMPONENT NAME\n   WEBS MQ FOR LIN\n   \n   \n * FIXED COMPONENT ID\n   5724B4105\n   \n   \n\nAPPLICABLE COMPONENT LEVELS\n * R530 PSY\n   UP", "document_id": "swg1IY98777"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I need to understand details regarding Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in SSLv3 affects IBM Integration Designer and WebSphere Integration Developer (CVE-2014-3566).

Remove all trailing spaces after each LDAP property in the customer_overrides.properties file or in the authentication_policy.properties file.\n\n2. If the LDAP server is configured for Server Authentication (not Client/Server Authentication), the two LDAP Keystore properties of LDAP_SECURITY_KEYSTORE and LDAP_SECURITY_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD are not needed. You only need to specify the two LDAP Truststore properties LDAP_SECURITY_TRUSTSTORE and LDAP_SECURITY_TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD in the SI Authentication_policy.properties file or in customer_overrides.properties file, the Truststore should contain the LDAP server public certificate.\n\n3. The key password should be the same as the KeyStore password. This is checked if configuring the LDAP keystore properties:\n\nLDAP_SECURITY_KEYSTORE=/home/yourkeystore.jks\nLDAP_SECURITY_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=yourpassword\n\n4. Using the Keytool Java Utility, which comes with SI located in the SI_install/jdk/bin dir. This command is used to list the certificates within the keystore file:\n\nkeytool -list -v -keystore your_keystore_name.jks\n\nAnd ensure the Keystore type is jks.\n\n5. On LDAP Windows Active Directory, you must use two back slashes when configuring the properties within SBI because at product initialization, one of the back slashes will be removed. This can be verified by using QueueWatcher in SBI and reviewing your properties file, for example: \n\nauthentication_policy.LDAP_SECURITY_TRUSTSTORE=E:\\\\IBM\\\\si_truststore_ikeyman.jks\nauthentication_policy.LDAP_SECURITY_KEYSTORE=E:\\\\IBM\\\\si_keystore_ikeyman.jks\n\nOnce SI is up and active, you can review the top of the SI Authentication log to ensure it is correctly pointing to your LDAP Truststore and Keystore directories correctly. For example you will see: <Java System Props> {javax.net.ssl.trustStore = E:\\IBM\\si_truststore, javax.net.ssl.keyStore = E:\\IBM\\si_keystore}\n\n6. Ensure your SBI user id is configured within SBI as an Authentication Type of External.\nAlso ensure this same user id is configured within the LDAP server using the same case.\n\n\n7. All of the required LDAP parameters should be configured within the authentication_policy.properties file or they can be configured within the customer_overrides.properties file using the correct prefix, authentication_policy. All of the needed properties should be in one or the other properties file. Best practice is to keep them in one location.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nCleared all trailing spaces after the LDAP properties.

It was presented at the ACM Con\u00adfe\u00adrence on Computer and Com\u00admu\u00adni\u00adca\u00adti\u00adons Se\u00adcu\u00adri\u00adty in October 2011 under the title How to Break XML Encryption [http://www.nds.rub.de/research/publications/breaking-xml-encryption/]. \nANSWER\nRECOMMENDATION:\nInstall a DataPower fix pack that contains the fix for APAR IC76651 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IC76651].\n\n\nLOCAL FIX: \nTo prevent this attack without installing the specified fixpack, you can use either or both of the following approaches: \n\n * Digitally sign the encrypted request message using XML Digital Signatures or Message Authentication/Integrity Codes (MACs), making sure to avoid decryption entirely unless the signatures are valid \n * Ensure that all responses after encountering an error are indistinguishable from each other, which is a simpler approach. Providing indistinguishable responses hardens a service against this attack with minimal configuration changes. \n\n\nTo configure your service to always return indistinguishable errors messages, add an error rule that matches on all error codes. This rule includes a transform action that runs the style sheet. If you have any existing error rules, you can override the output by adding a new transform action at the end of the rule. The following XSLT style sheet returns a generic SOAP Fault. \n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> \n<xsl:stylesheet version=\"1.0\" xmlns:xsl=\" http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform [http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform] \"> \n<xsl:template match=\"/\"> \n<env:Envelope xmlns:env=\" http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/ [http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/] \"><env:Body><env:Fault><faultcode>env:Client</faultcode><faultstring>Internal Error (from client)</faultstring></env:Fault></env:Body></env:Envelope> \n</xsl:template> \n</xsl:stylesheet>  \n\nFor details on configuring an error rule, see \"Processing Policies\" in the appropriate Information Center. To access the Information Center, go to DataPower Documentation Portal [http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/datapower/library/documentation/]. \n\n PROBLEM CONCLUSION: \nInstall the fix pack containing APAR IC76651 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IC76651]. \n\nThis fix adds a new property, \"rewrite-errors,\" to XML Firewall, Multi-Protocol Gateway, Web Service Proxy and Web Application Firewall. Rewrite Errors protects services against XML decryption attack by unifying error messages and is on by default. \n\nThis APAR is in fix packs 3.7.3.19, 3.8.0.13, 3.8.1.12, 3.8.2.4 and 4.0.1.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration WebSphere DataPower B2B Appliance XB60 Firmware 4.0.2, 4.0.1, 3.8.2, 3.8.1, 3.8 Business Integration WebSphere DataPower B2B Appliance XB62 Firmware 4.0.2, 4.0.1 Business Integration WebSphere DataPower Integration Appliance XI50 Firmware 4.0.2, 4.0.1, 3.8.2, 3.8.1, 3.8 Business Integration WebSphere DataPower Integration Appliance XI52 Firmware 4.0.2, 4.0.1 Business Integration WebSphere DataPower Integration Blade XI50B Firmware 4.0.2, 4.0.1, 3.8.2, 3.8.1 Business Integration WebSphere DataPower Low Latency Appliance XM70 Firmware 3.8, 3.8.1, 3.8.2, 4.0.1, 4.0.2 Business Integration WebSphere DataPower Service Gateway XG45 Firmware 4.0.2 Business Integration WebSphere DataPower XML Security Gateway XS40 Firmware 4.0.2, 4.0.1, 3.8.2, 3.8.1, 3.8", "document_id": "swg21501021"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Why does WebSphere Portal take over 30 minutes to start up and show hung thread message on thread server.startup?\nExample message from SystemOut.log:\n[3/3/15 5:58:47:293 EST] 00000019 ThreadMonitor W WSVR0605W: Thread \"server.startup : 1\" (00000015) has been active for 692705 milliseconds and may be hung.

This error will occur when you attempt to create a new view in a directory which contains other view related files such as .view files. These files will exist in a directory that is currently (or was) in use as a view storage directory.\n    \n 2. This error has also been shown to be caused by left over view.dat files from snapshot views that were not removed correctly. The view.dat file resides in the view work space or view root; the location where the files are loaded. Be sure to check the parent directory and then traverse up the directory structure to the root of the drive as well. ClearCase will check those directories as well to ensure that the new view is not within another view.\n    \n 3. Attempts to make use of an existing (dynamic) view storage directory using cleartool mkview [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cchelp/v7r0m0/topic/com.ibm.rational.clearcase.cc_ref.doc/topics/ct_mkview.htm?resultof=%22%6d%6b%76%69%65%77%22%20]will result in the above error. \n    \n 4. The UNC global path is being assigned to an explicit Storage Location that is located inside another existing view. \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n \n\nSolution for Cause 1\n\nAs specified in the error, you cannot create a new view in an existing view's storage directory.\n\nThe location you specify for storing the new view should be a ClearCase server storage location [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21147041], a network share on Windows or an export on UNIX or Linux.\n\nA network share is a location on a computer network, typically allowing multiple users on the same network to have a centralized space for storing and accessing data. You can review this Microsoft article 301198 [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/301198/en-us] for more information.\n\nAn export on UNIX or Linux is a way to make a local resource available for mounting by remote systems. For more information, you should refer to the man page for export or share. Otherwise, consult your systems administrator.\n\nWhen creating a view, you should be sure that the directory is not in use by an existing view and that it does not contain remnants of a previous view, which may have not been properly removed.\n\nA view directory contains the following files and directories: \n\n * .access_info A file of view access event information that is periodically updated by the view_server.\n   \n   \n * .pid A one-line text file that lists the process ID of the view\u2019s view_server process.\n   \n   \n * admin A directory that contains administrative data related to the amount of disk space a view is using. Use space \u2013view to list this data.\n   \n   \n * config_spec A file that stores the view\u2019s current config spec, in the form displayed by catcs.\n   \n   \n * .compiled_spec A modified version of config_spec, which includes accounting information.\n   \n   \n * .identity On UNIX, a subdirectory whose zero-length files establish the view\u2019s owner and group memberships.\n   \n   \n * identity.sd On Windows, a binary data file that contains the security descriptor for the view storage directory.\n   \n   \n * .s A subdirectory that implements the view\u2019s private storage area.\n   \n   \n * db A subdirectory containing the files that implement the view\u2019s embedded database.\n\n\nRefer to the IBM Rational ClearCase Administrator's Guide for more information on View Administration. \n\n\nSolution for Cause 2 \n\nCheck the selected location to store the snapshot view work space directory (view root) to see if any view.dat files exist. \nNote: The view.dat files is a hidden file on Windows, so the option to show hidden files and folders in Windows Explorer will need to be enabled before a search can be conducted for these files.\n\nIf found, remove them and attempt the view creation again.\n\n\nSolution for Cause 3\n\nUse these commands to get past this issue:\n\n\n * cleartool register -view <view storage directory> \n * cleartool mktag -view -tag <viewtag> <view storage directory>\n\n\nThe view tag will now exist and the view can be started. \n\nNote: You will need to be the owner of the view storage directory to create a tag for the view. \n\n\nSolution for Cause 4 \n\nSelect the Advanced View options button and verify the UNC path under \"Use Explicit Path\". This path can not live inside another views .vws folder. \n\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Software Development Rational ClearCase View: Snapshot Software Development Rational ClearCase View: Snapshot", "document_id": "swg21227672"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Is WebSphere Application Server 7.0 Test Environment Extension (WTE) v 7.0.0.41 available for Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software (RAD) ?

That way every URL starting with /myapp/* will be routed to the application in WAS.\n\nOn the other hand, fileServingEnabled=\"false\" means NO static files will be served from the application in WAS. In this case, a wildcard will NOT be used in the plugin-cfg.xml file. Instead, there will be several URI entries matching the URL-Patterns from <servlet-mappings> in the web.xml, like \"/myapp/servlet1\" and \"/myapp/index.jsp\". Requests for dynamic content matching the URI entries in the Plug-in config, will be routed to the application in WAS. But everything else (static content) will be handled by the IHS web server itself.\n\n\nANSWER\nIf you want to serve any static files (JPG, GIF, CSS, JS, etc) from your web application in WAS, you must use fileServingEnabled=\"true\" in the ibm-web-ext.xmi file. That will cause the plug-in to use a wildcard entry for the context-root of your web application. For example, if the context-root is \"myapp\", then there will be a URI entry for \"/myapp/*\" in the plug-in config, and everything starting with \"myapp\" will be routed to the application in WAS. \n\n\nNow, if you also want to be able to serve some of the static files from the IHS web server itself, you will need to do a trick using RewriteRule in the IHS config. Here is how the trick works:\n\n1) Create a subdirectory called \"static\" under the IHS DocumentRoot directory. And put the static files that you want IHS to serve into that directory. For example in the IHS document root directory (HTTPServer/htdocs/) create a subdirectory called \"static\". Something like this:\n/usr/IBM/HTTPServer/htdocs/static/\n\n2) In your web application, you will reference those files using relative references like \"static/picture.jpg\", or \"static/mystyles.css\".\n\nThose relative references will be interpreted as URLs like this:\n/myapp/static/picture.jpg\n/myapp/static/mystyles.css\n\nKeep in mind that there really is NOT any \"static\" subdirectory in the application. But that is ok.\n\n3) Now, in the IHS config, you must use RewriteCond and RewriteRule to watch for these references, and redirect to get them from IHS. For example, look at these directives...\n\n<ifModule mod_rewrite.c>\nRewriteEngine on\nRewriteRule ^/myapp/static/(.*) /static/$1 [PT]\n</ifModule>\n\nIt means, if the URI begins with /myapp/static/* then IHS will rewrite it to just /static/* and \"pass-through\". Since /static/* does NOT match anything in the Plug-in config, the request will be handled by IHS, and the file will be served from the static directory under IHS DocumentRoot.\n\nTo the user looking at the URL in the browser they will see this:\n/hostname/myapp/static/picture.jpg\n\nBut, the file will really be served by IHS from here:\n/hostname/static/picture.jpg\n\nHere is another example:\n\nIf you just want to match and serve *.gif files from IHS, use:\n\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \\.(gif)$ [NC]\nRewriteRule ^/myapp/(.*) /static/$1 [PT]\n\nIf you just want to match and serve *.gif, *.css and *.js files from IHS, use:\n\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \\.(gif|css|js)$ [NC]\nRewriteRule ^/myapp/(.*) /static/$1 [PT]\n\nWhich assumes the files themselves are placed in [IHS_DOC_ROOT]/static/.\n\n4) For the static files in the application, you will need to put them in some other directory that is NOT called \"static\", for example \"images/sunset.jpg\" would be a directory and file in the myapp application. This URL request, would be handled by the Plug-in and sent to the application in WAS:\nhostname/myapp/images/sunset.jpg\n\n\nSo, by using the trick described above, some static files will be served from IHS, like:\n/hostname/myapp/static/picture.jpg\n\nBut other static files will be served from the web application running in WAS, like:\n/hostname/myapp/images/sunset.jpg", "document_id": "swg21508890"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I need to understand details regarding Security Bulletin: Vulnerability with Diffie-Hellman ciphers may affect IBM SOA Policy Gateway Pattern for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 2.5 (CVE-2015-4000).

Any value for this attribute that is greater than 0 percent is displayed with a yellow background in the TEP. \n\nANSWER\nThere is a warning situation as soon as there is at least one slow request (e.g. one request is higher than the minimum response time threshold) \n\nExample:\nThe \"Application Current Status Details\" view shows: \nTotal Requests: 6133 \nSlow Requests: 85 \n\nAs properties, we have: \n- Minimum Response Time Threshold: 10,000 \n- and of course as \"Thresholds\" condition for the warning situation (yellow background) there is\nPercent Slow: > 0,000. \n\nThat means: 85 requests take more than 10 secs \ni.e. Percent Slow = 85/6133 * 100 = 1,386 %. > 0,000 % \n\n\n \nDue to condition \"> 0,000\" that there are slow requests, a warning situation fires. \n\n\n\n\nHISTORICAL NUMBER\n 08168\nSGC\n724 \n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n ITCAMfT TCAMfT CAMfT ITCAMfTRANSACTIONS ITCAM4TRANSACTIONS", "document_id": "swg21598157"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "\n\nHello everyone, you all know that ASD gives the possibility to export results in XML with File --> Export --> Scan Results as XML (Legacy...)

However, there is no longer a graphical tool such as CloudView (as with Cloudscape 5.x). In order to obtain the data and structure of the WebSphere Portal database, dblook and ij utilities can be used to accomplish such goals. \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n\nBefore proceeding with the following, it is strongly recommended that you back up your Derby database. Make a copy of <wp_profile>/PortalServer/derby/wpsdb to a backup directory. Since the version of Derby used in WebSphere Portal is embedded, you must stop the Portal server before you can access the database although you can always work on the backup copy.\n\nNOTE: For simplicity, we will omit the extension of the utilities. You should add \".sh\" or \".bat' depending on the platform.\n\nThere are three primary utility tools that are installed with WebSphere 6.1, \"dblook\", \"ij\", and \"sysinfo\", under the <was_root>/AppServer/derby/bin/embedded directory. The sysinfo utility generates information about the operating system, the Java version and classpath, and the Derby driver files and version information.\n\ndblook utility\nThe dblook utility is used to view the database structure (in DDL - Data Definition Language) for a specific database. \n\nThe usage is dblook -d <databaseURL> [options], where databaseURL is in the \"jdbc:derby:<database>\" format. The <database> should be given as a full path, such as C:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\wp_profile\\derby\\wpsdb. \n\nCommonly used options include: \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Examples:\n * \n * \n * dblook -d jdbc:derby:C:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\wp_profile\\PortalServer\\wpsdb -o C:\\temp\\wpsdb_ddl.sql\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * dblook -d jdbc:derby:C:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\wp_profile\\PortalServer\\wpsdb -z release -o C:\\temp\\wpsdb_ddl.sql\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * dblook -d jdbc:derby:C:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\wp_profile\\PortalServer\\wpsdb -z release -t user_desc -verbose -o C:\\temp\\user_desc.sql\n * \n * \n\n\nij utility \nThe ij utility is a command line SQL processor. It can be used to run DDL for creating database, tables, indexes, and so on. In a WebSphere Portal environment, it would typically be used for exporting data or making simple changes (when advised by IBM Support). \n\nTo start ij, simply open a command prompt or terminal window, change the directory and enter the command. You should then see the ij shell with prompt \"ij>\". \n\nThe following are some common commands that you may use when reviewing data in the Portal database.  * \n * ij> connect 'jdbc:derby:C:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\wp_profile\\derby\\wpsdb';\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * ij> show connections;\n * \n * \n *  CONNECTION0* - jdbc:derby:C:\\ibm\\websphere\\wp_profile\\portalserver\\derby\\wpsdb \n   * = current connection \n   ij> driver \"org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver'; \n * \n * \n * \n * ij> set schema=release;\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * ij> select * from user_desc where oid=1000;\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * ij> run 'myquery.sql';\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * ij> CALL SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_EXPORT_TABLE('RELEASE','USER_DESC','USER_DESC.SQL',';','|',NULL);\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * ij> \n * CALL SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_EXPORT_QUERY('SELECT * FROM RELEASE.USER_DESC','user_desc_query.sqlL',null,'|',NULL);\n * \n * \n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Derby utility from Apache [http://docs.oracle.com/javadb/10.3.3.0/getstart/cgsusingtoolsutils.html]\nDerby SQL references from Apache [http://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.1/ref/crefsqlj23296.html]\n\n\n \n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Organizational Productivity- Portals & Collaboration WebSphere Portal End of Support Products AIX, HP-UX, IBM i, Linux, Solaris, Windows, z/OS 7.0, 6.1", "document_id": "swg21381009"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "\n\nI saw zonecfg error while starting nodeagent and dmgr in solaris server\n\nMy env is Oracle Solaris 11.2 SPARC, and WAS is 8558, jave 1.7.

A coordinated update procedure should be followed when there is a need to change the user account and/or password. This procedure applies to FileNet Content Engine 4.x and above. \n\n * \n * Note: \n * \n * \n\n\nIf the same user account is also used as the CE Bootstrap user, the corresponding user in the BootstrapConfig.properties needs to change as well. For changing the GCD admin user/password in BootstrapConfig.properties specifically, refer to this documentation: \nhttp://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/p8docs/v4r5m1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.p8.doc/admin/security/sec_how_change_bootstrap_pwd.htm [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/p8docs/v4r5m1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.p8.doc/admin/security/sec_how_change_bootstrap_pwd.htm] \n\n\n1. Launch FEM and the application server's administrative console. \na. Login to FEM using the Directory Service account. \nb. Login to the application server administrative console with an administrator account. \n\nImportant: Do not close above two applications until you have completed step 5 below. \n\n\n2. Make LDAP account changes: \na. Change the password for an existing account on the LDAP server - Using LDAP interface, change the password for the CE Directory Service account. \nOR \nb. Create a new user account on the LDAP server for the CE Directory Service account. \n\n\n3. Add new user (if applicable), to FEM \nIf the bind user is also the CE admin user, then the bind user will need to be added to all the existing objects in the P8 domain. Please read Update object store with new users and groups [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/p8docs/v4r5m1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.p8.doc/admin/security/sec_how_update_os.htm] for instructions \n\n\n4. Change Directory Configuration bind user in FEM \nUsing FEM (step 1a above), go to Domain properties > Directory Configuration > Select Directory Configuration > click on the Modify button > General Tab: \na. Modify the Directory Service User with new user's full distinguish name (DN) \nb. Click on Change password check box > change to a new password > click OK. \n\nAt this point you will be presented a dialog box with following message: \n\u201cThese changes require the application server to be restarted. Please restart the application server to incorporate these changes\u201d \n\nclick OK > click OK \n\nImportant: Do not restart the application server until you have completed step 5 below. \n\n\n5. Change the user in the application server's directory configuration \n\n- For Websphere, in the WebSphere Administrative Console, go to Global Security > click on Configure under User Account Repository > Modify Bind Distinguished Name (DN) > Modify Bind Password > click OK and Save changes \n\n- For WebLogic go to Security Realms > myrealm > Providers > ldap provider and click on \"Provider Specific\" tab in WebLogic Admin Console. Change \"Principal\" and \"Credential\". \n\n- For JBoss go to <JBoss Home>\\server\\<CE Server>\\conf directory and edit \"login-config.xml\". \nFind \"FileNet\" application-policy and in login module change bindDN/bindCredential. \n\n\n6. Changing the CE Bootstrap user \n\nFor CE 4.5.x and above: \na. In the Configure Bootstrap Properties task, set the Bootstrap Operation property to Modify Existing. \nb. Confirm that the Bootstrapped EAR file property contains the path to the bootstrap file you need to edit. \nc. Change the Bootstrap user password. Use Configuration Manager's features to save and run the task. \nd. Run Configuration Manager's Deploy Application. \n\nFor CE 4.0: \nNote: This step is needed only if the GCD user name is the same as the Directory Service account. Note that the example below is for a Windows environment. \n\n- For WebSphere \na. Open command prompt window, go to folder where EAR file reside (it differs depending on CE version). For example, in CE 4.5.1, go to \"<CE Home> \\ tools \\ configure \\ profiles \\ <profile> \\ ear\" \nb. Backup Engine-ws.ear \nc. Execute the command below: \n\njava \u2013jar \u201cc:\\program files\\FileNet\\ContentEngine\\lib\\BootStrapConfig.jar\u201d \u2013e Engine-ws.ear --username <username> --password <password> \n\nd. Since the Engine-ws.ear file has been deployed in the WebSphere's installedApps path, the Bootstrap file need to be copied to the path manually. Extract the props.jar file from the ear file by utility such as Winzip, copy the props.jar file to theinstalledApps location - \u201c<WebSphere Home>\\ AppServer\\ profiles \\ <profile name> \\ InstalledApps \\<serverNodecell> \\ FileNetEngine.ear \\ APP-INF \\ lib \\\" \n\nNote that an alternative to copying the props.jar file is to uninstall and re-install the updated ear file in WebSphere. \n\n- For WebLogic \na. Open command prompt window, go to folder - \"<WebLogic home> \\ user_projects \\ domains \\ <domain> \\ servers \" \nb. Backup FileNetEngine.ear \nc. Execute the command below: \n\njava \u2013jar \u201cc:\\program files\\FileNet\\ContentEngine\\lib\\BootStrapConfig.jar\u201d \u2013e Engine-wl.ear --username <username> --password <password> \n\n- For JBoss \na.

For example: INSERT INTO tab1 VALUES (X'C3')\n\n * By running the IMPORT or LOAD commands for files which contain character data that is not in the code page of the client machine, so the appropriate code page conversion was not done. To make sure that the the appropriate code page conversion is done when running IMPORT or LOAD, specify the code page of the input file by including the \"codepage=x\" file type modifier (specifying the code page in place of x).\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nYou can use the HEX function to find out what are the byte values in a character column. \n\nFor example, to find out the byte values in column COL1 in table TAB1, run: \nSELECT HEX(col1) FROM tab1\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nUpdate the invalid data with a valid UTF-8 character string. \n\n\nAlternatively, for JCC driver versions that support it you can set the JCC configuration property db2.jcc.charsetDecoderEncoder=3 so that instead of throwing an exception the JCC driver returns the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER (U+FFFD) in place of a sequence of bytes that is not a valid UTF-8 string. \nThe JCC configuration property db2.jcc.charsetDecoderEncoder is supported in versions of the JCC driver that come with DB2 LUW 9.5 Fix Pack 8 and later (APAR IC74896), DB2 LUW 9.7 Fix Pack 5 and later (APAR IC74895), and all DB2 LUW releases from DB2 10.1 onwards.\n\nFor example, suppose you have a Java program MyApp.java that executes an SQL query of a database column that contains a sequence of bytes that is not a valid string.\nWhen you run:\njava MyApp\nit throws an exception. But when you run:\njava -Ddb2.jcc.charsetDecoderEncoder=3 MyApp\nit returns the string with any invalid sequence of bytes replaced by the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER. \n\nThe Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER often appears like this \n(a diamond with a question mark inside it) : [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21684365&amp;aid=1]\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n APAR IC78495 [https://www-01.ibm.com/support/entdocview.wss?uid=swg1IC74895]\nAPAR IC74896 [https://www-01.ibm.com/support/entdocview.wss?uid=swg1IC74896]\nMaking the setting for IBM Data Studio [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21612346]\nMaking the setting for IBM Content Collector [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAE9L_4.0.0/com.ibm.content.collector.doc_kc/troubleshooting/ts_afu_java_throws_exception.dita]\nUDF to identify invalid data in a UTF-8 character colum [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21608985]\nHow invalid data can get into a UTF-8 character column [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21412846]\nLOAD command [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPGG_10.5.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.cmd.doc/doc/r0008305.html]\nIMPORT command [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPGG_10.5.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.cmd.doc/doc/r0008304.html]\nHEX function [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPGG_10.5.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.ref.doc/doc/r0000811.html]", "document_id": "swg21684365"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "When will CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V4.1 and V4.2 be withdrawn from support?

Application Server doesn't\n   certify with OracleDataSource but does support it (support\n   falls under other configuration part of our support statement).\n   To enable Oracle pooling in Application Server do the\n   following:\n   \n   1) create a user defined provider.  Use the following\n   configuration:\n   \n       Implementation class: oracle.jdbc.pool.OracleDataSource\n       helper:\n   com.ibm.websphere.rsadapter.Oracle10gDataStoreHelper\n   \n   2) create a datasource under the new provider created in 1\n   with the following custom properties:\n   disableWASConnectionPooling = true\n   connectionCachingEnabled=true\n   connectionCacheName=<your cache name>\n   removeExistingOracleConnectionPoolIfExists = true\n   URL = <Oracle URL>\n   \n   Note that you will need the\n   removeExistingOracleConnectionPoolIfExists  be set to have\n   Application Server remove any existing Oracle poolings.\n   Otherwise, Oracle will fail getConnection.\n   \n   \n   Limitation of the Oraclepooling:\n   1) doesn't support XA\n   2) order of who the DS custom properties  get set is\n   important.  This could become an issue as Application Server\n   passes the properties as a collection and hence the order is\n   not guaranteed.  If you hit this issue, you need to contact\n   Oracle and reference TAR:6499673.994\n   3) oracle will not display a message if the pool creation\n   fails, instead a normal connection is returned. Thus, you nee\n   to watch for that.  You can confirm that pool is created by\n   running your application and then trying to issue a\n   testConnection. Test connection should fail with an exception\n   that the oracle pool name is already used. Note however, that\n   the testConnection must be executed in the save JVM (that is,\n   server level) thus, you will need to create your datasource\n   and provider in the server scope.\n   \n   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion\n   in fix pack for 6.0.2.27\n   Please refer to the recommended updates page for delivery\n   information:\n   http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27004980 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27004980]\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nTEMPORARY FIX\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nAPAR INFORMATION\n * APAR NUMBER\n   PK55772\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT NAME\n   WEBS APP SERV N\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT ID\n   5724H8800\n   \n   \n * REPORTED RELEASE\n   60A\n   \n   \n * STATUS\n   CLOSED PER\n   \n   \n * PE\n   NoPE\n   \n   \n * HIPER\n   NoHIPER\n   \n   \n * SPECIAL ATTENTION\n   NoSpecatt\n   \n   \n * SUBMITTED DATE\n   2007-10-31\n   \n   \n * CLOSED DATE\n   2008-01-30\n   \n   \n * LAST MODIFIED DATE\n   2008-01-30\n   \n   \n\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED FROM ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n * APAR IS SYSROUTED TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n\nFIX INFORMATION\n * FIXED COMPONENT NAME\n   WEBS APP SERV N\n   \n   \n * FIXED COMPONENT ID\n   5724H8800\n   \n   \n\nAPPLICABLE COMPONENT LEVELS\n * R60A PSY\n   UP\n   \n   \n * R60H PSY\n   UP\n   \n   \n * R60I PSY\n   UP\n   \n   \n * R60P PSY\n   UP\n   \n   \n * R60S PSY\n   UP\n   \n   \n * R60W PSY\n   UP\n   \n   \n * R60Z PSY\n   UP\n   \n   \n * R61A PSN\n   UP\n   \n   \n * R61H PSN\n   UP\n   \n   \n * R61I PSN\n   UP\n   \n   \n * R61P PSN\n   UP\n   \n   \n * R61S PSN\n   UP\n   \n   \n * R61W PSN\n   UP\n   \n   \n * R61Z PSN\n   UP", "document_id": "swg1PK55772"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Is there a limit to the number of items that can be listed within an \"in\" list as part of a where clause?

The preferred technique for thwarting guesses at Session IDs is the generation of unique session identifiers using a FIPS 140-2 approved random number generator. However, it is recognized that available DBMS products do not all implement the preferred technique yet may have other protections against session hijacking. Therefore, other techniques are acceptable, provided they are demonstrated to be effective. \"\n\nA: No because DB2 does not use session ids for authentication and thus not vulnerable to the attack described above. DB2 uses encryption modules which are FIPS 140-2 certified.\n\nDB2 v8.x compliancy to FIPS 140-2\n\nDB2 v8.x went out of support in April 2009.\n\nWhat is ICC?\n\nICC (IBM Crypto for C) is a set of libraries from Tivoli\u00ae for performing encryption. As of DB2\u00ae Universal Database\u2122 (DB2 UDB) Version 8 fixpak 7 (equivalent to DB2 UDB Version 8.2), DB2 is using ICC on most platforms.\n\nCustomers who need to operate in an environment that is compliant with FIPS 140-2 federal standard should take into account the releases of ICC that are shipped by DB2 on different platforms and the compliance status of those releases with FIPS 140.2.\n\nFollowing is a list of platforms on which DB2 is using ICC for encryption of data flowing between clients and servers:\n\nDB2 V8 Fixpak 7 through DB2 Fixpak 11: \nICC Version 1.2.2 on platforms:\nAIX 32 bit\nHP-UX PA-RISC 32 bit\nICC Version 1.2.1 on platforms: \nAIX 64 bit\nHP-UX PA-RISC 64 bit\nHP-UX IA64\nLinux x86, Linux x86-64, Linux IA64\nLinux for zSeries\nLinux for POWER\nWindows x86 and IA64\nSolaris SPARC 64 bit\nICC Version 1.3.9 on platforms:\nSolaris x86-64 (DB2 V8.2 GA)\n\nDB2 V8 Fixpak 12 and later: \nICC Version 1.4.1 on platforms \nAIX\nHP-UX PA-RISC\nLinux x86 and x86-64\nLinux for zSeries\nLinux for POWER\nWindows x86 and x86-64\nSolaris SPARC\nICC Version 1.3.9 on platforms \nHP-UX IA64\nLinux IA64\nWindows IA64\n\nSummary of known problems encountered in ICC 1.2.1/1.2.2:\nThere are a number of issues with DB2 and the ICC encryption libraries at levels prior to 1.3.9. The known problems are: \n\n\n 1. Severe performance problems where processes seem to hang, or take several minutes to run. \n 2. A bug in ICC code causes it to communicate with the OpenSSL EGD (Entropy Gathering Daemon) which under certain circumstances could hang \n 3. ICC symbols have not been namespaced and DB2 can end up with symbol collisions with OpenSSL code. This can also happen when multiple versions of ICC are used within the same process.\n\n\nDB2 Version 8 Fixpak 12 and later incorporates IBM Crypto for C (ICC) version 1.3.9 or 1.4.1 cryptographic module which fixes these problems. \n\n \n\nNote: The latest status of ICC conformance with FIPS 140-2 standard can be obtained by referring to http://www.ibm.com/security/standards/st_evaluations.shtml [http://www.ibm.com/security/standards/st_evaluations.shtml]\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n FIPS PUB 140-2 [http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips140-2/fips1402.pdf]", "document_id": "swg21237078"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How to prevent rule execution failing because of recurrent StaleConnectionException on ODM 8.8 Rule Execution Server?

If yes, temporary disable it so WAS trace can be enabled. \n\n5. The WebSphere Application Server logging has stopped, what may have caused this? \n\nThe user might have disabled the trace by setting trace output to none. \n\nSetting runtime trace output to none impacts the JVM logs. To do that, the runtime trace spec will be set to *=off, which means to turn off all log levels. If customers just want to disable the trace for debug information only, we recommend setting the runtime trace spec, accordingly, instead of setting runtime trace output to none. For example, set to *=info, which is the default. \n\nVerify if the commons-logging.jar and commons-logging.properties exist in the JVM classpath. If yes, suggest to remove it and put them inside the application (with parent_last setting) or put them in the isolated shared library. \n\n6. How can I separate my logs into separate files for each application? \n\nIn WAS V8.5, we added the application name to log and trace records stored using HPEL (High Performance Extensible Logging). Since HPEL lets you format and filter your log content after it has been persisted to the HPEL log/trace repository, this lets you decide if you want to see your application content on its own (helpful for uncluttered debug of an application), or together with the application server log/trace content (helpful to see impact of server on applications, and vice versa). \n\nFor example, if you had 3 applications called app1, app2, and app3, you could create app specific logs as follows: WAS_INSTALL_ROOT\\bin> logViewer -includeExtensions appName=app1 > app1.log\nWAS_INSTALL_ROOT\\bin> logViewer -includeExtensions appName=app2 > app2.log\nWAS_INSTALL_ROOT\\bin> logViewer -includeExtensions appName=app3 > app3.log \nor see everything in one file as follows: \n\nWAS_INSTALL_ROOT\\bin> logViewer > all.log \n7. How can I add my own java.util.logging.Handler to WAS? \n\nTo create a Handler you need to extend the java.util.logging.Handler class as follows (this example also shows how to filter for only the most severe messages): \n\nimport java.util.logging.Handler;\nimport java.util.logging.Level;\nimport java.util.logging.LogRecord;\npublic class MyHandler extends Handler {\npublic void close() {\n}\npublic void flush() {\n}\npublic void publish(LogRecord record) {\nif (record.getLevel().intValue() >= Level.SEVERE.intValue()) {\n// do something...\n}\n}\n}\nIn your application you can add that Handler to the root logger as follows:\nimport java.util.logging.Handler;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n...\nHandler myHandler = new MyHandler();\nLogger logger = Logger.getLogger(\"\");\nlogger.addHandler(myHandler);\n... \n8. Why can't I set my own log levels using the Logger setLevel method? \n\nThe application server can run in two modes. \n\nBy default, the logger levels are managed, and we expect any changes to logger levels to be done only through wsadmin or through the admin console. When the trace spec update is applied, we explicitly set each logger to the level specified in the trace spec -- we do not leave any named loggers at level set to null. So, while you can change a logger's level using the setLevel method, that change only lasts until you apply your next trace spec update from wsadmin or the admin console. Basically, changes you make via logger.setLevel are temporary at best, and do not apply automatically to children since the children won't have a null level. \n\nAlternately, you can have the server to be configured by the JRE's logging.properties file by setting the java.util.logging.configureByLoggingPropertiesFile property. In this mode, the application server will not touch the logger levels -- you cannot update the levels through the admin console, nor through wsadmin. See Java virtual machine custom properties [http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/wsbroker/redirect?version=matt&product=was-base-dist&topic=xrun_jvm] for more information on this setting. In this mode, you can specify anything you would normally specify in your logging.properties file. Be careful not to use a console handler though, as that will lead to an infinite loop, since we take data sent to System.out, turn it into LogRecords, and send it to the root logger. \n9. How can I get java.util.logging to initialize from a jre/bin/logging.properties file in the application server? \n\nYou can do this via system property: java.util.logging.configureByLoggingPropertiesFile=true\n\nNote that if you do set up your server in this mode, we will not manage your logger levels via the admin console.\n\nNote also that we will ignore any console handler entries found in the logging.properties file, since we route System.out to the root logger, which would mean that a console handler would cause an infinite recursion. \n\nIf you do use this system property, and you want to change logger levels, you have two choices:\n\n\n * \n * 2) Set the Logger levels programatically using the Logger.setLevel method\n   \n\n10. How can I get the full logger name from log and trace records? \n\nThe full logger name can be handy to know for enabling trace. How you get to it depends on what log and trace mode you use: \n\nBasic log and trace mode: \n\nThe basic log format (not to be confused with basic log and trace mode), which is the default format for SystemOut.log / SystemErr.log / trace.log has a truncated version of the logger name: \n\n[4/14/11 9:41:45:218 EDT] 00000021 QuickLogTest W hello fine 54857 \nThere is no way to get the full logger name from basic formatted logs. You need to switch to advanced format for your logs/trace if you want to see the full logger name. Once in advanced format, log contents appear as follows: \n\n[4/14/11 9:41:45:218 EDT] 00000021 W UOW= source=com.ibm.somelogger.QuickLogTest org= prod= component= thread=[WebContainer : 4]\nhello fine 54857 \nHPEL log and trace mode: \n\nYou can use the HPEL LogViewer command line tool to output the log/trace content in either basic or advanced format. \n\n> logviewer -format basic \n\n....\n[4/14/11 9:41:45:218 EDT] 00000021 QuickLogTest W hello fine 54857\n.... \n> logviewer -format advanced \n\n....\n[4/14/11 9:41:45:218 EDT] 00000021 W UOW= source=com.ibm.somelogger.QuickLogTest org= prod= component= thread=[WebContainer : 4]\nhello fine 54857\n... \n11. How can I write HPEL content to a database? \n\nIf you want to write to a Database, any of the following options will work: \n\n1) Write your own log handler (that writes to a database) ", "document_id": "swg21995397"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "\n\nWhen trying to create the syndication pair for a virtual portal, I am getting the following exception:\n\n\"IWKWC0016E: The remote service can not be retrieved.

The value is dynamically changed by the plug-in during runtime. The \"weight\" of a server (or clone) is lowered each time a request is assigned to that clone. When all weights for all servers drop to 0 or below, the plug-in has to readjust all of the weights so that they are above 0. Using a starting value of only 2 (default), means that the weights will get to 0 very quickly and the plug-in will constantly be readjusting the weights. Therefore, It is recommended to start with a higher LoadBalanceWeight. The IBM WebSphere Application Server administrative console will allow a value up to 20 for this. However, it is certainly possible to manually edit the plugin-cfg.xml file and specify some other value for LoadBalanceWeight that is higher than 20.\n\nNote: At runtime, the LoadBalanceWeight of each appserver in a cluster are normalized by their highest common factor. For example, 100, 90, 80 have a common factor of 10. So, these configured weights would be divided by 10 at runtime, resulting in actual starting weights of only 10, 9, 8. Setting all clones to the same starting LoadBalanceWeight (for example: 20, 20, 20) will result in an actual starting weight of only 1 for each, because of normalization. So, it is recommended to set the weight of at least one of the clones to be off by a value of 1. For example, if there are 3 clones, you might choose the starting LoadBalanceWeights to be: 20, 20, 19. After normalization the weights will be unchanged.\nRecommended values = all clones the same, except one clone off by one (for example: 20, 20, 19)\n\n\nMaxConnections is used to gauge when a server is \"starting to become overwhelmed\". It is not used to determine when to fail-over (mark the server \"down\"). When a request is sent from the plug-in to the WAS appserver, it is called a \"PendingRequest\", until the response comes back. If the application running in WebSphere Application Server is handling requests quickly, each request will only be PENDING for a very short time. So, under ideal conditions, MaxConnections is not needed and therefore the default is (-1) meaning unlimited. However, sometimes an application may start to become overwhelmed and the application may not be able to handle the requests as quickly. Consequently Pending Requests start to build up. MaxConnections can be used to put a limit on the number of PENDING requests per server. When the MaxConnections limit is reached, the plug-in will stop sending requests to that appserver, but it is not marked down. The optimal value for MaxConnections will depend on how quickly the application and appserver respond to each request. If normal responses are returned in less than one second, it may be appropriate to set a low value for MaxConnections, like 20 or so. However, if it normally takes several seconds to get a response from the application, then it would be prudent to use a higher value for MaxConnections, like 100. Please note that if the MaxConnections limit has been reached the plug-in will not send ANY more requests to that server until responses come back for the current PENDING requests, and the pendingRequests count drops back down below the MaxConnections limit.\nRecommended value = 20 - 100 depending on application response times\n\n*Best Practices: with MaxConnections=\"-1\" use LogLevel=\"Stats\" to monitor the pendingRequests numbers in the plug-in log, under normal conditions. Then, choose a value for MaxConnections that is significantly higher than the highest number shown in the log. This method will help you to determine a MaxConnections value that is right for your specific environment.\n\n\nConnectTimeout means \"how long should the plug-in wait when trying to open a socket to the Application Server\"? If there are streams already open and available to the Application Server, the plug-in will use one of those. However, sometimes the plug-in needs to open a new stream to the Application Server. That should not take very long, so the value for ConnectTimeout should be very small. A ConnectTimeout value of 0 means never time-out. In that case, the time-out is left up to the OS TCP layer, which is NOT ideal. It is much better to specify a small positive number (like 5 seconds).\nRecommended value = 5\n\n\nServerIOTimeout means \"how long should the plug-in wait for a response from the application\". After the socket is opened, the plug-in sends the request to the Application Server. The application processes the request and a response is sent back to the client, through the plug-in. How long should that take? What is reasonable, based on the application? There is no single correct answer here. It depends on the application. If the application is very quick to respond, then you can use a lower value for ServerIOTimeout. However, if the application requires more time to process the request (maybe to retrieve data from a database), then you should use a higher number for ServerIOTimeout. Using a value of 0 means that the plug-in will NOT time-out the request. This is often NOT ideal. A positive value means that the plug-in will NOT mark the appserver down after a ServerIOTimeout pops. So, if you want the plug-in to continue sending requests to the timed-out appserver, use a positive value. On the other hand, a negative value means that the plug-in WILL mark the appserver down after a ServerIOTimeout pops. So, if you want the plug-in to immediately mark the appserver down and fail-over to another appserver in the same cluster, use a negative value.\nRecommended value = -900 (that is negative 900)\n\nNote: The ability to use a negative ServerIOTimeout value was introduced in plug-in apar PK72097 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK72097].\n\n*Best Practices: use traces to determine the amount of time it takes for your application to respond to requests under normal conditions. Be sure to include the longest running requests that take the most time to respond. Then choose a value for ServerIOTimeout that is much larger (2X or 3X or more) than the longest response time. This method will ensure that your ServerIOTimeout is high enough to allow adequate time for the application to respond normally. Make it a negative value so that if the ServerIOTimeout pops, the plug-in will immediately mark the server down, and retry the request to a different appserver.\n\n\nServerIOTimeoutRetry can be used to decrease the number of retries after ServerIOTimeout has fired. By default, the Plug-in will try a request equal to the number of members in the cluster. For example, if the cluster has four members, and there is a ServerIOTimeout, the Plug-in will try it a second time. If the retry fails with ServerIOTimeout fired, then it will try a third time, and a fourth time if needed. But after four attempts, the Plug-in will give up and stop retrying. If you want to override this default behavior and reduce the number of retries after ServerIOTimeout, you can set ServerIOTimeoutRetry to a value that is less than the number of members in the cluster.\nRecommended value = -1 (this is the default)\n\nNote: This property was introduced by Plug-in apar PM70559 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM70559].\n\n\nRetryInterval is the time that the plug-in will wait before trying again to use an appserver that was marked down. The optimal value for RetryInterval depends on the number of appservers in the cluster, and the value used for ServerIOTimeout. You can use the following formula to determine the maximum RetryInterval value for your plug-in config:\n\n(number of appservers in cluster - 1) x (absolute ServerIOTimeout) - 1\n\nFor example, if there are two appservers in the cluster, and the value of ServerIOTimeout is -900, then the maximum RetryInterval setting would be:\n(2 - 1) x (900) - 1 = 899 seconds or less\n\nAnother example, if there are four appservers in the cluster, and the value of ServerIOTimeout is -900, then the maximum RetryInterval setting would be:\n(4 - 1) x (900) -1 = 2699 seconds or less\n\nWarning: Setting RetryInterval to a value higher than the recommended maximum, based on the formula above, can lead to an undesirable situation where all of the appservers in the cluster may be marked down simultaneously resulting in all requests temporarily failing.\nRecommended value = 60 (this is the default)\n\n\nAffinity requests are requests that contain a session cookie (ie. JSESSIONID). The session cookie is set by the Session Manager in WAS to ensure that all subsequent requests from the same client return to the same app server in the cluster. The session cookie contains the clone ID (or partition ID) of that specific app server. The web server Plug-in will look for the session cookie and use the clone ID to send the request to that specific WAS app server. An affinity request is not load balanced.\n\nIn the plug-in config there is a property called IgnoreAffinityRequests. This property determines if affinity requests will affect the load balance weights, or not. The default value for IgnoreAffinityRequests is True, which means that affinity requests will not have any affect on the load balance weights. This is best for environments where there are no, or few, affinity requests. On the other hand, for an environment with a lot of affinity requests, it may be better to set IgnoreAffinityRequests to False so that the load balance weights will accurately reflect the effect of having a lot of affinity requests.\n\n\nFail-over occurs when the plug-in marks a cluster member appserver (or clone) as \"down\", and then sends the pending requests to other members of the same cluster. This can happen if the plug-in is unable to open a new connection to the appserver within the ConnectTimeout. Or fail-over can happen if the plug-in has already sent the request to the appserver, but does not receive a response from the application within ServerIOTimeout. When the plug-in marks a cluster member appserver \"down\", it will handle the PENDING requests in one of two ways: Prior to plug-in apar PM12112 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM12112], the plug-in would send all of the pending requests to the very next appserver in the cluster. However, after plug-in apar PM12112 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM12112], the plug-in will randomly send the pending requests to any of the available appservers in the cluster. While the appserver is marked \"down\" the plug-in will no longer send any requests to it. After RetryInterval the plug-in will check to see if that appserver can be used successfully again. If so, the \"down\" flag will be removed and the appserver will be used again.\n\nNote: By default, the number of attempts to handle a request is limited by the number of appservers in the cluster. For example, if there are only two appservers in the cluster, and the request fails once, the plug-in will only attempt that request one more time (total of two attempts). Or another example, if there are five appservers in the same cluster, and the request fails once, then the plug-in will attempt to retry that same request up to four more times (total of five attempts). That number includes retries sent to the same appserver (session affinity), or attempts sent to different appservers (fail-over).\n\nUpdate: The plug-in apar PM70559 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM70559] introduced a new setting called \"ServerIOTimeoutRetry\" that can be used to control th", "document_id": "swg21318463"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "\n\nI downloaded SPSS about 3 weeks ago.

The client accepts a handshake using an ephemeral ECDH ciphersuite with the server key exchange message omitted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to launch further attacks on the system.\nCVSS Base Score: 1.2\nCVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99705 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99705] for the current score\nCVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined\nCVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)\n\nCVEID: CVE-2015-0204 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0204]\nDESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in the OpenSSL ssl3_get_key_exchange function could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain TLS connections. An OpenSSL client accepts the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. \n\nThis vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack. \n\nCVSS Base Score: 4.3\nCVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99707 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99707] for the current score\nCVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined\nCVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) \n\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS\nIBM Rational RequisitePro versions:\n\n\n\nVersion Status 7.1.4 through 7.1.4.7 Affected 7.1.3 through 7.1.3.14 Affected 7.1.2 through 7.1.2.17 Affected 7.1.1.x (all versions) Affected \nNot all deployments of Rational RequisitePro use OpenSSL in a way that is affected by these vulnerabilities. \n\nYou are vulnerable if your use of Rational RequisitePro includes any of these configurations: \n 1.

Before you can continue working on IBM BPM, you must log out and log in again. \n\nCAUSE\nWebSphere Application Server has session security integration enabled by default. Enabling this feature guards against the possibility of session data being hijacked by another user. \nThe Wily Introscope agent might try to access an active user session to monitoring purposes. Because Wily does not have the same authenticated user, the session security integration feature prevents Wily from accessing that user session. \n\nBy having a custom property named InvalidateOnUnauthorizedSessionRequestException set to true, the session manager will invalidate the active user session. This causes the \"session expired\" messages for the IBM BPM user. (The default value for InvalidateOnUnauthorizedSessionRequestException is false.)\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nTo verify you have this problem, you can turn on tracing for the Web container, the session, security, and IBM BPM using these tracing strings: \n\n\n*=info:com.ibm.ws.webcontainer*=all:com.ibm.wsspi.webcontainer*=all:HTTPChannel=all:GenericBNF=all:com.ibm.ws.session.*=all:com.ibm.ws.security.*=all:com.ibm.websphere.security.*=all:com.ibm.websphere.wim.*=all:com.ibm.wsspi.wim.*=all:com.ibm.ws.wim.*=all:WLE.*=all \n\nYou might see entries in the stack trace similar to the following lines:\n\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.servlethelper.ServletRequestHelper.getSession(ServletRequestHelper.java:286)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.servlethelper.ServletRequestHelper.get(ServletRequestHelper.java:513)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.trace.hc2.HttpServletLazyMapProvider.get(HttpServletLazyMapProvider.java:63)\nat com.wily.util.adt.LazyMap.get(LazyMap.java:182)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.trace.hc2.HttpServletLazyMap.putAllParameters(HttpServletLazyMap.java:191)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.trace.hc2.HttpServletTracer.IInvocationDataParameterCallback_addParameters(HttpServletTracer.java:782)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.trace.InvocationData.addParameterCallbacks(InvocationData.java:3486)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.feature.VirtualStackFeatureHelper.fillComponentParams(VirtualStackFeatureHelper.java:157)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.feature.VirtualStackFeatureHelper.getTransanctionSnapShotFromInvocationData(VirtualStackFeatureHelper.java:235)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.feature.VirtualStackFeatureHelper.getTransactionSnapshotFromStack(VirtualStackFeatureHelper.java:75)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.feature.StallFeatureBase.reportStall(StallFeatureBase.java:50)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.feature.StallCheckBehaviorCorrect.ITimestampedRunnable_execute(StallCheckBehaviorCorrect.java:61)\nat com.wily.util.heartbeat.IntervalHeartbeat$BehaviorNode.execute(IntervalHeartbeat.java:972)\nat com.wily.util.heartbeat.IntervalHeartbeat.executeNextBehaviorAndCalculateSleepTime(IntervalHeartbeat.java:491)\nat com.wily.util.heartbeat.IntervalHeartbeat.access$2(IntervalHeartbeat.java:445)\nat com.wily.util.heartbeat.IntervalHeartbeat$HeartbeatRunnable.run(IntervalHeartbeat.java:668)\nat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:784)\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nTo prevent the sessions from expiring, choose one of the following options: \n\n * Stop the Wily agent. \n * Remove the custom property InvalidateOnUnauthorizedSessionRequestException=true by completing the following steps: 1. Log in to the administrative console. \n   \n   2. Click server_name > Session Manager > Custom properties. \n   \n   3. Select the InvalidateOnUnauthorizedSessionRequestException property, which is set to true, and delete it.\n   The purpose of this setting in BPM default configuration is to \"gracefully\" terminate existing sessions and create new sessions in shared browser scenarios. With this setting removed, you may see temporary exceptions in cases two users share the same browser instance and try to switch identity without closing the browser in between. \n   \n   4. Click Apply and then save the master configuration. \n   \n   5. Restart the servers. \n   \n   \n * Disable specific Wily configurations that reuse the session IDs from existing users.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n CA Technologies: Session killed by agent heartbeat [http://www.ca.com/us/support/ca-support-online/product-content/knowledgebase-articles/tec1314663.aspx]\n\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration IBM Business Process Manager Standard AIX, Linux, Solaris, Windows 8.5.7.CF201706, 8.5.7.CF201703, 8.5.7.CF201612, 8.5.7.CF201609, 8.5.7.CF201606, 8.5.7, 8.5.6.2, 8.5.6.1, 8.5.6, 8.5.5, 8.5.0.2, 8.5.0.1, 8.5, 8.0.1.3, 8.0.1.2, 8.0.1.1, 8.0.1, 8.0 Business Integration IBM Business Process Manager Express Linux, Windows 8.5.7.CF201706, 8.5.7.CF201703, 8.5.7.CF201612, 8.5.7.CF201609, 8.5.7.CF201606, 8.5.7, 8.5.6.2, 8.5.6.1, 8.5.6, 8.5.5, 8.5.0.2, 8.5.0.1, 8.5, 8.0.1.3, 8.0.1.2, 8.0.1.1, 8.0.1, 8.0 \nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n BPM", "document_id": "swg21966881"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "The ConfigTrace.log shows the following....\n\n     [wsadmin] com.ibm.websphere.management.exception.AdminException:\n     ADMA5026E: No valid target is specified in ObjectName\n     WebSphere:cell=<cellname>,node=<nodename>,server=webserver1 for\n     module ilwwcm-authoring.war+WEB-INF/web.xml.\n       [wsadmin] ADMA5026E: No valid target is specified in ObjectName\n     WebSphere:cell=<cellname>,node=<nodename>,server=webserver1 for\n     module ilwwcm-authoring.war+WEB-INF/web.xml.\n", "id": "TRAIN_Q561", "answers": [{"answer_id": 58799186, "document_id": "swg21632223", "question_id": "TRAIN_Q561", "text": "If using a remote Dmgr, be sure it is started prior to attempting the upgrade. \n\n2.

If YES is specified, the system attempts to automatically start the CICS VR server address space.\n\nThe start command is passed to DFSMS and CICS VR through the z/OS Subsystem Interface. CICS VR code in the SSI runs the start command to start a new address space (IEESYSAS) and runs program DWW1SJST to start the CICS VR server address space. This process requires that program DWW1SJST is in the LPA or a LNKLST dataset.\n\nIf the CICS VR server address space is not automatically started during system initialization, it can be started at a later time by running the VARY SMS,CICSVR,ACTIVE operator command on the system.

Notice that the upgrade is within the same Version.Release (7.0) and a migration to a newer Version.Release is not forced. \n\n\n+ Compatibility of MQ clients and CCDT files \n\nNewer versions of the MQ clients (such as 8.0) know how to handle CCDT files that were created/edited by older queue managers (such as 6.0) \n\nOlder MQ clients (such as 6.0) do NOT know how to handle CCDT files that were created/edited by newer queue managers (such as 8.0). That is, older clients do not know what are the new attributes (if any) introduced in newer MQ versions. \n\nBased on the above, if you have a mix of versions of MQ clients that use a common CCDT file, then this CCDT file should be edited from a queue manager at the LOWEST (OLDEST) version. For example, if you are using MQ 6.0, 7.0, 7.1, 7.5, 8.0 and 9.0 clients that use a CCDT file, then the CCDT file must be maintained by the MQ queue manager at version 6.0 \n- However, the newer MQ clients (8.0) when using the CCDT created with 5.3 will NOT be able to fully exploit newer features, even when connecting to an 8.0 queue manager because the CCDT will not show the new attributes for those new features. \n\nMQ CCDT created version Compatible MQ client versions \n\n6.0 6.0 7.0 7.1 7.5 8.0 9.0 \n7.0 7.0 7.1 7.5 8.0 9.0 \n7.1 7.1 7.5 8.0 9.0 \n7.5 7.1 7.5 8.0 9.0 \n8.0 8.0 9.0 \n9.0 8.0 9.0 \n\nNotes: \n- There was no change in the MQCD length between 7.1 and 7.5. Therefore the CCDT created on 7.5 can be used on 7.1. \n- There was no change in the MQCD length between 8.0 and 9.0. Therefore the CCDT created on 9.0 can be used on 8.0. \n- Unless documented otherwise, CCDTs created on higher level maintenance releases (for example 8.0.0.3) are compatible with lower level (for this example: 8.0.0.0) MQ clients running the same MQ version and release. \n\nUpdate on July 2016: \nThere are 2 APARs that allow OLDER MQ clients to use NEWER CCDT files! \nThese APARs relax the restriction by allowing newer CCDTs to be used on older clients but with the caveat that the older client cannot make use of any of the newer channel attributes. These attributes will assume their default values when the CCDT is negotiated with the queue manager. \n. \nFor Java/JMS client applications: \nIT10863: WEBSPHERE MQ CLASSES FOR JAVA/JMS APPLICATIONS CAN NOT USE CCDT FILES GENERATED ON A NEWER LEVEL QUEUE MANAGER [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IT10863] \nVersion Maintenance Level \nv7.0 7.0.1.14 \nv7.1 7.1.0.8 \nv7.5 7.5.0.6 \nv8.0 8.0.0.3 \n\nFor C based (and non-Java/JMS) client applications: \nIT11547: WEBSPHERE MQ CLIENT APPLICATIONS CANNOT USE CCDT FILES GENERATED ON A NEWER LEVEL QUEUE MANAGER [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IT11547]. \nThis applies to C based and non-Java/JMS applications. \nVersion Maintenance Level \nv7.1 7.1.0.8 \nv7.5 7.5.0.7 \nv8.0 8.0.0.3 \n\n\n+ Compatibility of MQ clients and JMS .bindings files \n\n- A JMS .bindings file that was created at an older version (such as 7.1) than the MQ JMS client (such as 8.0) will be used without version related errors by the client. \n\n- A JMS .bindings file that was created at a newer version (such as 8.0) than the MQ JMS client (such as 7.1), will be used without version related errors by the client.

The most common scenario is prevalent with Taskmaster Web scanning, upload and verification. \n\nUsing the latest software and patching, batches already on hold should be restricted to the operator (and potentially station ID) stored for that batch. For batches that are in pending status, enforce batch queuing using the Store and Queue To workflow task settings. \n\n 1. Run Taskmaster Client (only in Taskmaster 8.0.1 and earlier) or Taskmaster Web. \n 2. Select Settings | Workflow in the client or go to Settings tab of Administrator in Taskmaster Web. \n 3. Highlight respective tasks in turn (ex: Scan, Upload and Verify), and set the following:  * Queue To - Select the option on how batches need to be restricted. \n     * Store - Select the information that needs to be stored. Note that Queue To settings will not work properly if the needed information was not set to Store in the previous task (ex: upload).\n    \n    \n 4. Select the Users or Groups tab depending on the Taskmaster Server authentication mode. \n 5.

At 200 DPI this means each bar must be at least .01 inch. Generally this translates to about 4 to 5 characters per inch. \n * The X-dimension or width of the narrowest black bar and white space between bars must be at least 20 mils (1/50 inch, 1/2 mm).

Optimally the height should be at least 1/4 inch or 15% of the width, whichever is greater, though this is not an absolute requirement. The minimum quiet zone (white space before and after the bar code) specified by the standard is 1/5 inch. \n * Scanning can sometimes introduce white or black stripes on the image running in the scanning direction, typically vertical stripes if the paper is scanned in Portrait orientation. Bar codes printed in normal horizontal orientation cannot be read reliably when this occurs. It is advisable to print barcodes perpendicular to the direction of scanning. If the barcode must be printed horizontally on a page, scanning in landscape orientation will make the barcode more robust in the presence of common scanner issues. \n * By default, Datacap only accepts barcode images with 71% confidence or higher. To modify it to accept low confidence barcodes also, add the following action to run prior to barcode detection:  * SetMinimumConfidenceBP(1) - This is equivalent to 11% confidence. Each increment increases the required confidence 10% and higher values can be used if false barcodes are detected. A value of 4 is usually sufficient for this purpose.\n   \n   \n * Barcode recognition has an internal barcode enhancement capability. To maintain high performance, this feature is turned off by default. If low quality barcodes are being received, it may be desired to turn on barcode enhancement, despite the performance hit. To do this, add the following action to run prior to barcode detection:  * rrSet(1,@P.bp_enhance)\n   \n   \n * Performing Datacap's regular image enhancement (ImageFix) prior to running any barcode recognition action is not recommended. ImageFix is designed to optimize text recognition and can actually degrade the barcode. There are some rare exceptions, and if it is necessary to use image enhancement prior to barcode recognition, pay close attention to the configuration settings, especially vertical line removal and despeckle. To ensure image processing is not interfering with barcode recognition, test with the ImageFix() action removed.\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Enterprise Content Management Datacap Taskmaster Capture Not Applicable 8.1.0", "document_id": "swg21500300"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How to enable the snippet results cache in the Netezza Platform Software releases?

Each new version adds new features and modifies internal details. \n\nWhether the RRT agent supports TLS1.1/1.2 depends on whether the underlying JRE supports TLS 1.1/1.2. The JRE that supports the RRT agent and the JRE that supports RPT workbench must both support the same version of TLS and the same ciphers. \n\nFor example, RRT 7.3 FP01 supports RPT 8.3.0.3, but RPT 8.3.0.3 does not support TLS1.1/1.2. Consequently, RRT 7.3 FP01 also does not support TLS 1.1/1.2.\n\nIn comparison, RRT 7.4 with IF21 or IF24 (7.4.0.0-TIV-CAMRT-IF0021 or 7.4.0.0-TIV-CAMRT-IF0024) can support RPT 8.3 and RPT 8.6 since RPT 8.6 supports TLS1.1 /1.2, and the IBM Java 7 included with RRT 7.4 also supports TLS 1.1/1.2. \n\nHowever, when a script uses TLS 1.2/1,2, some ciphers may not be supported. To verify whether certain cipher suites are supported, visit the IBM Java Knowledge Center:\n\nIBM Java Cipher Suite Information\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_7.0.0/com.ibm.java.security.component.70.doc/security-component/jsse2Docs/ciphersuites.html?lang=en [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_7.0.0/com.ibm.java.security.component.70.doc/security-component/jsse2Docs/ciphersuites.html?lang=en]\n\n\nDo You Need to Patch Java?\n\nFirst, determine whether your script uses 256-bit ciphers. In RPT workbench, open the script in Test Editor mode. In the left panel, drill down through the Server Access Configurations. Select SSL.\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21960133&amp;aid=1]\n\nIn the right panel, examine the available ciphers that display. If the list contains 256-bit ciphers, you need to support Strong Encryption in RPT and the RRT agent. The name identifies the encryption level. For example, SSL_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA is a 256-bit cipher. The presence of 256 in the cipher name means that the cipher supports 256-bit encryption. \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21960133&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21960133&aid=2]\n\nCipher Naming Conventions\n\nIn RPT workbench, the cipher name always begins with \"SSL\" to simplify naming conventions. If the script uses TLS as the protocol in the test, then the cipher is a TLS cipher.\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21960133&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21960133&aid=3]\n\nPlayback Symptoms\n\nCheck whether your script playbacks indicate that the RRT JRE needs to be patched to support Strong Encryption. Strong Encryption adds 256-bit ciphers.\n\n1) The Playback Status workspace shows that playbacks are complete, but the Verification Failures workspace shows:\n\nEvent Type: Generic Failure\n\nViolated Value: java.lang.RuntimeException occurred in IBM Registration.

To use less restricted encryption algorithms, you need to download and apply the unlimited jurisdiction policy files (local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar). \n\nSee Enabling Strong encryption greater than 128 bit key lengths in Rational Performance Tester\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21245273 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21245273]\n\nUse the following instructions to patch the JRE that the RRT agent uses.\n\nNote: Backup the jar files that these steps replace -- before you replace these files.\n\n1) Go to the IBM developerWorks Java Technology Security page for JRE 6 security information. \nSee https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/security/ [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/security/]\n\n2) Click on the \"Java SE 6\" link. \n\n3) Click on the \"IBM SDK Policy files\".\n\n4) On the Sign in page, enter your developerWorks IBM ID and password.\n\n5) After successfully logging in, select Files for Java 5.0 SR16, Java 6 SR13, Java 6 SR5 (J9 VM2.6), Java 7 SR4, and all later releases.

Generate the self signed key/certificate pair using the \"crypto tool\" from the DataPower device. \n 2.  Download the two files to your local machine. For the sake of illustration purpose, the names of the key and certificate files are defined as \"dpmqclient-privkey.pem\" and \"dpmqclient-sscert.pem\" respectively. \n 3. Assuming that openssl tool (www.openssl.org [http://www.openssl.org]) is installed in the local machine. With openssl tool, you can use the following command to create a \"pkcs12\" type key from the above key/certificate pair which are of PEM type. This step is necessary as MQ key database will not import key/certificate files created as PEM.\n    \n    openssl pkcs12 -export -out dpmqclient-key.p12-in dpmqclient-sscert.pem-inkey dpmqclient-privkey.pem-name ibmwebspheremqadmin\n    \n    Note the value associated with \"-name\" parameter. IBM WebSphereMQ client required a friendly label as \"ibmwebspheremq<userid>\" of the MQ client user. In this example, the user name is being used as \"admin\". This user must be used in the DataPower MQ Queue Manager object and it must also be an authorized user for both the DataPower MQ instance as well as for the remote WebSphere MQ Server. Please refer to Pages G58-62 in the 3.6.0-WebGui Guide for various fields as described in MQ Queue Manager configuration screen. Also note the following two fields with appropriate values which are required for the MQ Queue Manager object to connect the remote WebSphere MQ Server in SSL mode. \n\n *  SSL Key Repository: The key database file name \n   SSL Cipher Specification: TRIPLE_DES_SHA_US \n   \n\nTo import a personal certificate using \"iKeycmd\" GUI, use the following commands in your host machine where the WebSphere MQ Server/Client is running. \n * UNIX\n * \n * \n *  gsk7cmd -cert -import -file filename -pw password -type pkcs12 -target filename -target_pw password -target_type cms \n * \n * \n * Windows\n * \n * \n *  runmqckm -cert -import -file filename -pw password -type pkcs12 -target filename -target_pw password -target_type cms \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * -file \n * filenam \n * \n * \n * -pw \n * password\n * \n * \n * -type \n * pkcs12 \n * \n * \n * -target \n * filename\n * \n * \n * -target_pw \n * password\n * \n * \n * -target_type \n * cms\n * \n\n\n\nGenerate the new password file \n\nFollow these steps to generate the new password file. \n 1.  Start the iKeyman GUI using either the gsk7ikm command (on UNIX) or the strmqikm command (on Windows). \n 2.  From the Key Database File menu, click Open. The Open window displays. \n 3.  Click Key database type and select CMS (Certificate Management System). \n 4.  Click Browse to navigate to the directory that contains the key database files. \n 5.  Select the key database file in which you want to save the certificate, for example key.kdb. \n 6.  Click Open. The Password Prompt window displays. \n 7.  Type the password you set when you created the key database and click OK. \n 8.  The name of your key database file displays in the File Name field. The Personal Certificates menu will display both \"ibmwebspheremq<qmgr>\" and \"ibmwebspheremq<user>\" labels. \n 9.  In the WebSphere MQ Certificate key database, there is one certificate assigned to the queue manager or client. The certificate's Friendly Name attribute contains the string ibmwebspheremq followed in lower case by the queue manager name or the client logon ID.
