Trail commissions are calculated as a percentage of account value.     Commissions for variable annuities are based on the age of the oldest owner or annuitant.     The trail commission is paid to the current servicing agent of record provided the Annuity Contract is still in effect.   Servicing agent means the broker dealer or Registered Representative appointed by us and accepted by the contract owner as the  servicing agent. If the contract owner requests a change in the servicing agent or if we decide that a change would be in the best  interests of the contract owner, trail commissions will be paid to the new servicing agent or his/her broker dealer where appropriate.  No trail commissions are paid after termination of this Agreement.\n\n  A.

Other than the security interest Granted to the Issuer under this Agreement, the Depositor has not transferred or Granted a security interest in any of the Depositor Transferred Property.

In addition, the Servicer may waive late payment charges or other fees that may be collected in the ordinary course of servicing a Receivable. The Servicer may grant extensions, refunds, rebates or adjustments on any Receivable or amend any Receivable according to the Servicing Procedures. However, if the Servicer (i) grants payment extensions resulting in the final payment date of the Receivable being later than the Collection Period immediately preceding the Final Maturity Date for the latest maturing Class of Notes, (ii) cancels a Receivable or reduces or waives (including with respect to any Upgrade Offer) the remaining Principal Balance under a Receivable or any portion thereof and/or as a result, the monthly payments due thereunder, or (iii) modifies, supplements, amends or revises a Receivable to grant the Obligor under such Receivable a contractual right to upgrade the related Device, it will acquire the affected Receivable solely as described under Section 3.3, unless it is required to take the action by Law.

If in a legal proceeding it is held that the Servicer may not enforce its rights or remedies with respect to a Receivable on the grounds that it is not a real party in interest or a holder entitled to enforce rights or remedies with respect to the Receivable, the Issuer will, at the Servicer's expense and direction, assign the Receivable to the Servicer solely for that purpose or take steps to enforce its rights and remedies with respect to the Receivable, including bringing suit in the names of the Indenture Trustee, the Noteholders and the Issuer.\n\n(f) Powers of Attorney. The Issuer appoints the Servicer as the Issuer's attorney-in-fact, with full power of substitution to exercise all rights of the Issuer for the servicing and administration of the Receivables.

For any acquisition of a Receivable by the Servicer under this Section 3.3, the Servicer will acquire the Receivable by remitting the related Acquisition Amount on or prior to the second Business Day before the Payment Date related to the Collection Period in which such Receivable was acquired by the Servicer. If Cellco is the Servicer, it may pay any Acquisition Amounts according to Section 4.3(c).\n\n(e) Transfer and Assignment of Acquired Receivables. When the Servicer's payment of the Acquisition Amount for a Receivable is included in Available Funds for a Payment Date, the Issuer will be deemed to have transferred and assigned to the Servicer, effective as of the last day of the Collection Period immediately preceding the related Collection Period, all of the Issuer's right, title and interest in the Receivable and all security and documents relating to the Receivable. The transfer and assignment will not require any action by the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee and will be without recourse, representation or warranty by the Issuer except the representation that the Issuer owns the Receivable free and clear of any Lien, other than Permitted Liens. After the transfer and assignment, the Servicer will mark its receivables systems to indicate that the receivable is no longer a Receivable and may take any action necessary or advisable to transfer the Receivable free from any Lien of the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee.\n\n(f) No Obligation to Investigate. None of the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee (including in its capacity as Successor Servicer hereunder), the Sponsor, the Marketing Agent, the Depositor, the Parent Support Provider, the Administrator or the Servicer will be obligated to investigate whether a breach or other event has occurred that would require the acquisition of any Receivable under this Section 3.3 or whether any Receivables are otherwise required to be acquired under this Section 3.3.\n\n(g) Acquisition is Sole Remedy.

Any Recoveries will be paid to the Servicer as Supplemental Servicing Fees and will not be a part of Available Funds. If the Servicer elects to sell a Written-Off Receivable, the Receivable will be deemed to have been transferred and assigned by the Issuer to the Servicer immediately before the sale by the Servicer. After the sale, the Servicer will mark its receivables systems to indicate that the Written-Off Receivable sold is no longer a Receivable and may take any action necessary or advisable to transfer the receivable free from any Lien of the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee.\n\nSection 3.5 Servicer Reports and Compliance Statements.\n\n(a) Monthly Investor Report.\n\n(i) On or about the 15th day of each month, and in no case later than at least two (2) Business Days before each Payment Date, the Servicer will deliver to the Depositor, the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee, the Note Paying Agent, the Cap Counterparty, the Rating Agencies and the Administrator a servicing report (the \"Monthly Investor Report\") for that Payment Date and the related Collection Period.

On or before each Payment Date and each Acquisition Date, the Servicer will determine whether the pool of Receivables to be held by the Issuer as of the related Cutoff Date, including any Additional Receivables to be acquired, satisfies the Credit Enhancement Test and each Pool Composition Test. If the pool of Receivables does not satisfy all of the Pool Composition Tests, the Administrator may identify Receivables in the pool as Temporarily Excluded Receivables so that the remaining Receivables in the pool will satisfy all of the Pool Composition Tests; provided, that the Administrator may only deem Receivables to be Temporarily Excluded Receivables if the Overcollateralization Target Amount is reached as of the close of business on such date of determination, without taking into account the Temporarily Excluded Receivables. In addition, the Principal Balance of any Temporarily Excluded Receivables will be subtracted from the Adjusted Pool Balance for\n\n11\n\nSource: VERIZON ABS LLC, 8-K, 1/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n\npurposes of calculating the Credit Enhancement Test. The Servicer will state on the Acquisition Date Supplement for each Collection Period for which there is an Acquisition Date the aggregate Principal Balance of the Receivables deemed Temporarily Excluded Receivables. For the avoidance of doubt, Collections on Temporarily Excluded Receivables (solely during the time that they are Temporarily Excluded Receivables) will not constitute Available Funds and, up to the amount of the Temporarily Excluded Receivables Servicing Fee will be distributed to the Servicer, and any remaining amounts will be deposited into the Certificate Distribution Account for distribution to the Certificateholders in the priority set forth in Section 4.1(b) of the Trust Agreement. The Administrator may, at its sole option, designate Receivables that were deemed Temporarily Excluded Receivables on any prior date to no longer be deemed Temporarily Excluded Receivables as long as after such designation by the Administrator, all of the Pool Composition Tests either will remain satisfied or will not be adversely affected.\n\n(c) Amortization Events.

Any access or review will be subject to the Servicer's security, confidentiality and privacy policies and any regulatory, legal and data protection policies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the permissive right of the Indenture Trustee to access or review any records of the Servicer shall not be deemed to be an obligation of the Indenture Trustee to do so.\n\n12\n\nSource: VERIZON ABS LLC, 8-K, 1/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 3.7 Servicer's Authorized and Responsible Persons.

The parties acknowledge that the failure of the Marketing Agent to deposit, or to cause the related Originator to deposit, into the Collection Account the related Upgrade Payment or otherwise to pay off the Receivable would constitute a breach by the related Originator of its obligation to the Obligor under the Upgrade Contract and that this breach would adversely affect the value of the Receivables, and give the Obligor a claim in recoupment against the related Originator and a right to offset that claim against the amounts that the Obligor would owe to the related Originator under the new device payment plan agreement (each such agreement, a \"New Upgrade DPP\") entered into by the related Originator (or its agent, on its behalf) pursuant to the Upgrade Contract. The parties hereto intend that the payment by the Marketing Agent or the related Originator of the Upgrade Payment as provided in this Section 4.3(g) shall extinguish such Obligor's claim in recoupment against the related Originator and the Obligor's right to offset the amount of that claim against the amounts that the Obligor would owe under the New Upgrade DPP contemporaneously with such Upgrade Payment by the Marketing Agent or the related Originator.

If an Originator or the Servicer allows a device payment plan agreement that is a Receivable to be transferred to a new Obligor, the Marketing Agent shall acquire such Receivable and deposit, or cause the related Originator to acquire and deposit, into the Collection Account an amount equal to the applicable Acquisition Amount for the related Receivable on or prior to the second Business Day before the Payment Date related to the Collection Period in which such transfer occurred.\n\nSection 4.4 Reserve Account; Negative Carry Account; Acquisition Account.\n\n(a) Initial Reserve Account Deposit.

Dispute resolution to resolve reacquisition or acquisition requests will be available regardless of whether Noteholders and Note Owners voted to direct an Asset Representations Review or whether the Delinquency Trigger occurred.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Owner Trustee shall have no obligation whatsoever to participate in any dispute resolution, mediation or arbitration to determine if a reacquisition or acquisition request has been resolved within the applicable 180-day period. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Indenture Trustee does not agree to pursue or otherwise be involved in resolving any reacquisition or acquisition request or dispute resolution proceeding, the related Noteholders or Verified Note Owners may independently pursue dispute resolution in respect of such reacquisition or acquisition. If the Indenture Trustee brings a dispute resolution action based on Noteholder direction to do so, the \"Requesting Party\" shall be deemed to be the requesting Note Owners (or the party to the arbitration) for purposes of the dispute resolution proceeding, including allocation of fees and expenses. The Indenture Trustee shall not be liable for any costs, expenses and/or liabilities allocated to a Requesting Party as part of the dispute resolution proceeding.

In each such case, each arbitrator will be impartial, knowledgeable about and experienced with the laws of the State of New York and an attorney specializing in commercial litigation with at least 15 years of experience.\n\n(iii) Each arbitrator will be independent and will abide by the Code of Ethics for Arbitrators in Commercial Disputes in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

The arbitral panel will resolve the dispute in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and may not modify or change this Agreement in any way. The arbitral panel will not have the power to award punitive damages or consequential damages in any arbitration conducted by them. In its final determination, the arbitral panel will determine and award the costs of the arbitration (including the fees of the arbitral panel, cost of any record or transcript of the arbitration, and administrative fees) and reasonable attorneys' fees to the parties as determined by the arbitral panel in its reasonable discretion. The determination in any binding arbitration of the arbitral panel will be in writing and counterpart copies will be promptly delivered to the parties. The determination will be final and non-appealable and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n(vii) By selecting binding arbitration, the selecting party is giving up the right to sue in court, including the right to a trial by jury.\n\n(viii) No person may bring class or collective claims in arbitration even if the Arbitration Rules would allow them. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the arbitral panel may award money or injunctive relief in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.\n\n(d) The following provisions will apply to both mediations and arbitrations:\n\n(i) Any mediation or arbitration will be held in New York, New York; and\n\n(ii) The details and/or existence of any unfulfilled reacquisition or acquisition request, any informal meetings, mediations or arbitration proceedings conducted under this Section 11.2, including all offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the parties' attempt to informally resolve an unfulfilled reacquisition or acquisition request, and any discovery taken in connection with any arbitration, will be confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment, in any mediation, arbitration or litigation, or other proceeding (including\n\n50\n\nSource: VERIZON ABS LLC, 8-K, 1/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nany proceeding under this Section 11.2).

No later than [***] after the filing of a BLA, Vericel shall\n\n8 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nfurnish MediWound the first rolling Forecast. Subject to this Section 2.8, the [***] of each Rolling Forecast shall constitute a binding order for the quantities of Product specified (\"Binding Forecast\"). The remaining [***] of each Rolling Forecast shall be non-binding, but shall represent Vericel's good faith estimate, as of the date of its submission of the Rolling Forecast, of its forecasted requirements of the Product during such period. MediWound shall maintain at all times the manufacturing capacity at the relevant Facility to manufacture [***] of the quantities of Product set forth in the current Calendar Year of the Rolling Forecast (as was set forth at the Rolling Forecast submitted immediately prior to the beginning of such Calendar Year) which in any event will not exceed the Maximum Capacity.\n\n(b) Purchase Orders. On a Calendar Quarter basis, Vericel shall issue at least one Purchase Order for the number and unit size of each Product specified in the Binding Forecast. Vericel is not limited to one Purchase Order per Calendar Quarter. Each Purchase Order shall specify (i) a purchase order number; (ii) the quantity of units of each Product to be Manufactured; and (iii) the requested delivery date of such Product (which in no event shall be earlier than [***] days following the date the applicable Purchase Order was received by MediWound). MediWound shall respond to each Purchase Order within [***] of receipt by: (i) accepting such Purchase Order if it conforms to the requirements of this Agreement or (ii) notifying Vericel if such Purchase Order does not conform to the requirements of this Agreement. If MediWound timely notifies Vericel that a Purchase Order does not conform to the requirements of this Agreement, the Parties shall confer as soon as reasonably practicable to resolve any issues related to such purported nonconformity. If MediWound fails to respond to a Purchase Order that is consistent with the Binding Forecast within [***] after receiving it, Vericel will, within [***] thereafter, confirm with MediWound that such Purchase Order was received by MediWound, and if such Purchase Order is consistent with the Binding Forecast and was properly submitted by Vericel in accordance with this Section 2.8(b), MediWound shall be deemed to have accepted such Purchase Order (\"Binding Order\") as of the date of MediWound's receipt of such Purchase Order. If a Purchase Order contains quantities of Products in excess of the quantity of such Product forecasted for such quarter (as was set forth at the Rolling Forecast submitted immediately prior to the beginning of such Calendar Year) by an amount greater than [***] of the Binding Forecast (\"Excess Amount\"), MediWound will accept the Purchase Order up to, but not including the Excess Amount which in any event will not exceed the Maximum Capacity. Should Vericel place a Purchase Order to procure a given Product in a given Calendar Quarter which includes an Excess Amount, MediWound shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet Vericel's request. If there is a conflict between this Agreement and any Purchase Order, this Agreement shall govern.\n\n(c) Minimum Purchase Obligation. In each Calendar Year following Vericel's submission of the first Rolling Forecast, Vericel shall issue Purchase Orders for at least [***] of the quantities of each Product set forth in the current Calendar Year of the Rolling Forecast (as was set forth at the Rolling Forecast submitted immediately prior to the beginning of such Calendar Year).\n\n(d) BARDA. As of the Effective Date, MediWound is a party to BARDA Contract HHSO100201500035C and BARDA Contract HHSO100201800023C (collectively, the\n\n9 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\n\"BARDA Agreements\") with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (\"BARDA\"). The Parties agree that until commercial obligations under such BARDA Agreements are transferred to Vericel, MediWound shall remain responsible for the supply and other obligations and shall manage the forecasts and production schedule for such BARDA Agreements. During such period, any Product ordered by BARDA from MediWound will not be included in Purchase Orders, Binding Orders, Rolling Forecasts or the minimum purchase obligation set forth in Section 2.8(c); provided that the Product ordered by BARDA from MediWound will be included in the Maximum Capacity and thus the applicable Maximum Capacity for the Binding Orders will be adjusted accordingly. If and when commercial obligations under such BARDA Agreements are transferred to Vericel, then Vericel shall become responsible for including the applicable purchases by BARDA in its Purchase Orders, Binding Orders and Rolling Forecasts and such purchases will be included in the Maximum Capacity and the minimum purchase obligation set forth in Section 2.8(c).\n\n2.9 Delivery.\n\n(a) Shipping. MediWound shall only ship Products that have been Manufactured and released in accordance with the Specifications. Unless agreed in advance by Vericel and MediWound in writing, MediWound shall not ship (or permit such Third Party packager to ship) any Products prior to approval and release by MediWound in accordance with the Quality Agreement and Regulatory Standards. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Parties, Products shall be delivered to Vericel Ex-Works (Incoterms 2010), at MediWound's facility (the \"Delivery Site\") at which point, the title and risk of loss shall transfer to Vericel which shall transfer the Products from the Delivery Site in accordance with cGMP as applicable. MediWound shall notify (or cause such Third Party packager to notify) Vericel at least [***] prior to any shipment of Products.\n\n(b) Delivery Amount. MediWound shall deliver Product within [***] of the units set out on the relevant Purchase Order. To the extent that a delivery is in excess of [***] of the amount set out on the relevant Purchase Order, Vericel may accept such excess Product provided that if Vericel accepts such excess, Vericel shall be entitled, (i) where commercially reasonable for Vericel, to vary the delivery date agreed between Vericel and MediWound in accordance with Section 2.8 for the immediately following shipment(s) of the applicable Product to the extent reasonably required due to the acceptance of such excess, and (ii) to reduce subsequent Purchase Orders and take credits for the amount of excess Product received against the minimum purchase obligation set forth in Section 2.8(c). To the extent that a delivery is less than [***] but at least [***] of the amount set out on the relevant Purchase Order, Vericel shall accept such delivery and shall be entitled, (A) where commercially reasonable for Vericel, to vary the delivery date agreed between Vericel and MediWound in accordance with Section 2.8 for the immediately following shipment(s) of the applicable Product due to the acceptance of such delivery, and (B) to increase subsequent Purchase Orders with the applicable shortage quantities.\n\n(c) On Time Delivery. MediWound's performance with respect to \"on time delivery\" will be measured as delivery to Vericel [***] before or after the delivery date agreed\n\n10 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nbetween Vericel and MediWound in accordance with Section 2.8; provided that MediWound shall be deemed to have made a delivery during the \"on time delivery\" window if the delay in delivery to Vericel is due to Vericel's failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement (including in connection with Vericel's review of the Batch records).\n\n2.10 Dating. The remaining shelf-life for each Product for the Territory shall be at least [***] of the FDA approved shelf-life of such Product, as measured from the time of delivery of such Product to Vericel (the \"Minimum Shelf Life\").\n\n2.11 Safety Stock. MediWound shall be entitled to meet its obligation to maintain as safety stock not less than [***] of the Rolling Forecast demand of stock of each of the Key Materials (the \"Safety Stock\") so long as the Minimum Shelf Life has been satisfied by holding either Product or an equivalent quantity of Materials, or a mixture of the two. The Parties will cooperate to set minimum inventory levels of Key Materials held by Key Materials Suppliers. Vericel shall maintain an inventory of [***] supply of unlabeled or labeled Finished Product in order to supply its commercial requirements in accordance with the Rolling Forecast, which may be stored at Facility at Vericel's option, cost and risk.\n\n2.12 Non-Conforming Product.\n\n(a) Rejection Notice. Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties in writing, within [***] after receipt of a delivery of Product hereunder, Vericel shall give MediWound written notice of rejection (\"Rejection Notice\") (i) if the Product does not constitute Conforming Product (\"Non-Conforming Product\") or (ii) of any shortage in quantity of such delivery of Product. Any such Rejection Notice provided with respect to any quantity of Product shall be deemed to apply to the full Batch of such Product unless otherwise specified by Vericel. Vericel shall be deemed to have accepted such shipment of Product as Conforming Product and any shortage in quantity if it does not provide Rejection Notice within [***] after receipt of delivery describing the reasons for such rejections in reasonable detail, provided, however, that such [***] period shall not apply to any Latent Defects, in which case Vericel shall notify MediWound of any such failure as soon as reasonably possible, but in any event within [***] after the Latent Defect is confirmed by Vericel and prior to expiration of the shelf-life for such Product.\n\n(b) Disputes. In the event that MediWound disagrees with Vericel's claim that Product fails to constitute Conforming Product, then the Parties shall promptly attempt to resolve such dispute. If the Parties cannot resolve such dispute, a sample of such Product shall be submitted by MediWound and Vericel to a mutually agreeable qualified Third Party laboratory for testing against the applicable Specifications, Regulatory Standards and other standards and controls in the Quality Agreement and the test results obtained by such laboratory shall be final and controlling (absent manifest error). Test results must be furnished to both Parties within [***] of concluding such testing. The fees and expenses of such laboratory testing and any obsolescence due to short dating shall be borne entirely by the Party whose original Product analysis was in error.\n\n11 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Remedy. On receipt of Vericel's Rejection Notice pursuant to Section 2.12(a), subject to Section 2.12(b), MediWound shall, [***] (except if such Non-Conforming Product is due to MediWound's gross negligence or willful misconduct):\n\n(i) deliver the appropriate shortage quantities of Conforming Product as promptly as possible, at no additional cost or expense (including, without limitation, freight costs) to Vericel;\n\n(ii) replace the Non-Conforming Product with Conforming Product as promptly as possible, at no additional cost or expense (including, without limitation, freight costs) to Vericel; or\n\n(iii) promptly grant Vericel a credit in an amount equal to the amount paid or payable by Vericel with respect to reasonable out of pocket expenses directly associated with the Non-Conforming Product to the extent applicable (e.g. shipment costs, destruction fees, and restocking fees) and any such shortage or Non-Conforming Product, including, without limitation, but solely in the case of Non-Conforming Product, expenses associated with destruction or return at MediWound's instruction. This subsection (iii) shall additionally apply in the event Vericel elects as its option the foregoing (i) or (ii), as applicable, and such delivery or replace of Product thereunder is not practicable within a reasonable period of time (as reasonably determined by MediWound).\n\n2.13 Shortages.\n\n(a) Without limiting any other rights or remedies available to Vericel, in the event of any shortage in the supply of any Materials or Product, or if MediWound is for any other reason unable to supply Product in compliance with the terms of this Agreement, then MediWound will promptly notify Vericel and, in the event such inability is caused by a shortage of any Materials and/or capacity required for the Manufacture of any Product, will take all commercially reasonable steps to (i) procure adequate quantities of Materials from Third Party suppliers reasonably acceptable to Vericel, and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill all Binding Orders for Product.\n\n(b) Prior to a Second Source commencing supply of Product, in the event of a shortage of (i) any Materials required to Manufacture Product or (ii) Product, MediWound will allocate the available Materials to the Manufacture of Product for sale to Vericel and will allocate the available Product for sale to Vericel, in each case ((i) or (ii)), to the extent any Binding Orders then in place prior to allocating such materials to the Manufacture of any other product (including EscharEx), or for any entity other than Vericel.\n\n(c) After a Second Source commences supply of Product, in the event of a shortage of Materials or Product, MediWound will allocate to Vericel its pro rata share of MediWound's supply of the same in a manner no less favorable than those of its equivalently situated customers or MediWound's own similarly situated products.\n\n12 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) The Parties will cooperate to discuss expansion plans, address capacity and any other product supply issues, including efficient use of resources, manufacturing schedules and shipping schedules.\n\n2.14 Supply Failures. In the event that MediWound becomes aware of the existence of a situation that may lead to a Supply Failure, then MediWound shall promptly (and in no event later than [***] from the date of such awareness) notify Vericel of the particular circumstances. MediWound and Vericel shall promptly discuss how to resolve such circumstances in an effort to avoid or mitigate such potential Supply Failure. MediWound shall investigate the root cause of the anticipated Supply Failure and prepare and provide to Vericel a Remediation Plan within [***] of MediWound's notice to Vericel. If the Remediation Plan is acceptable to Vericel, and MediWound is able to reasonably assure Vericel of MediWound's ability to Manufacture Product and, thereby, (a) avoid a Supply Failure or (b) supply Product in accordance with the Rolling Forecast within [***], then MediWound shall continue to Manufacture Product for Vericel. In all other cases, Vericel shall be permitted to take such measures as are reasonably determined in good faith by Vericel to ensure the supply of Product to the marketplace including cancelling or revising outstanding Purchase Orders and, at Vericel's option, Vericel's obligations under Section 2.8(a), (b) and (c) shall be deemed terminated.\n\nARTICLE 3  COMPLIANCE, QUALITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL\n\n3.1 Certificates of Analysis; Release. MediWound shall perform, or cause to be performed testing and other activities on each Batch of Product Manufactured pursuant to this Agreement before delivery to Vericel or Vericel's designated Affiliate or contractor and consistent with the testing and procedures specified in the Quality Agreement. In the event of any change in Specifications, the certificate of analysis shall contain the required information in accordance with the then-approved release tests in conjunction with applicable change control procedures in accordance with this Agreement and the Quality Agreement. MediWound shall send, or cause to be sent, such certificates to Vericel prior to delivery of each such Batch unless otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing or specified in the Quality Agreement.\n\n3.2 Records. MediWound shall maintain and shall cause each Supplier to maintain all Manufacturing records, including packaging, analytical and stability records, all records of shipment, and all validation data relating to the Product Manufactured and supplied to Vericel hereunder for the Territory to the extent and for the time periods required by applicable Regulatory Standards with respect to such Product. MediWound shall make such records and data available for Vericel's review on Vericel's reasonable request as mutually agreed by the Parties.\n\n3.3 Regulatory Compliance. MediWound shall advise Vericel promptly, but in any event within [***] on becoming aware of an authorized agent of a Regulatory Authority visit or inspection to its or any of the Suppliers' Facilities where the Products are being Manufactured for supply to Vericel for the Territory hereunder and in connection with the Manufacturing of the Products. MediWound agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to permit one or more\n\n13 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nVericel representatives to be present for all or part of such visit or inspection if Vericel so requests. MediWound shall use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to Vericel a copy of all material information supplied and/or issued by any Regulatory Authority to the extent that such report relates to the Manufacture or supply of Product to Vericel for the Territory, or the ability of MediWound or the Suppliers to so Manufacture or supply hereunder, within [***] of its receipt of such information. Before MediWound or any Supplier responds to any Regulatory Authority where such correspondence would reasonably be expected to have a material impact on the Manufacture or supply of Product to Vericel for the Territory, Vericel will be provided a reasonable opportunity, unless prohibited by applicable Law, to review and comment on the portion of such response related thereto, provided that Vericel shall conduct such review and provide such comments reasonably in advance of when any such response is due to such Regulatory Authority, and further provided that nothing herein, including failure by Vericel to provide such timely review and comment, shall in any way restrict MediWound or its Suppliers from taking, and MediWound and its Suppliers shall at all times be permitted to take, such actions or inactions necessary for its and their compliance with applicable Law. With respect to any and all requirements of a Regulatory Authority for the Manufacture of Product for Commercialization in the Territory following the First Commercial Sale of the Product in a country in the Territory, the Parties shall discuss in good faith such requirements and allocation of responsibility between the Parties.\n\n3.4 Audit.\n\n(a) Vericel shall have the right from time to time during the Term of this Agreement, but not more than [***] (unless (i) otherwise agreed between the Parties or (ii) if Section 3.4(b) below applies) during normal business hours and upon not less than [***] prior notice (unless Section 3.4(b)(iv) applies), to enter and inspect any Facility and any related utilities and/or services used in Manufacturing Product in order to carry out a cGMP quality and compliance audit of those parts of the Facility involved in or which could have any impact on Manufacture of such Product (including those used for storing, warehousing and/or testing and utilities), including for the purpose of confirming that no types of product which could reasonably be expected to impact the quality of the Product are being manufactured on site in deviation of cGMP.\n\n(b) In addition to the rights set out in Section 3.4(a), where (i) any audit carried out in accordance with this Section 3.4 has identified any breach of this Agreement, (ii) Vericel has a reasonable basis to suspect a breach of this Agreement, (iii) any previous audit carried out in accordance with this Section 3.4 has identified any major or critical findings, or (iv) if such audit is in response to or following an audit from a regulatory agency, and such audit resulted in a 483 or equivalent citation, then Vericel shall have the right to carry out, upon reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours, follow up compliance audit(s).\n\n(c) MediWound shall be solely responsible for ensuring the cGMP compliance status of subcontractors (where such subcontractors are carrying out activities to which cGMP applies) used in relation to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n14 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) MediWound shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure the right for Vericel to have the same inspection rights described in this Section 3.4 at the premises of any such subcontractor, and if unable to procure such rights, shall carry out such audits itself and shall report its non-confidential findings to Vericel.\n\n(e) The above obligations of MediWound and rights of Vericel shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the rights of MediWound and obligations of Vericel with respect to the undertaking of Vericel and its Affiliates, Sublicensees and Distributors to comply with the cGMP as applicable to their activities and the related audit rights to ensure such compliance.\n\n3.5 Results of Audits and /or Regulatory Inspection. Observations and conclusions of Vericel's audits will be issued to MediWound, which materials shall be deemed Confidential Information, provided that any Confidential Information of MediWound contained therein or upon which such observations and conclusions are based shall remain the Confidential Information of MediWound. MediWound and Vericel shall, at Vericel's expense (unless the result is due to a material breach of MediWound of any of its obligations under this Agreement), (a) cooperate to determine the cause for any identified issues, (b) work together in good faith to develop a corrective action, and (c) endeavor to implement such corrective action within a mutually agreed time period thereafter.\n\n3.6 Regulatory Information. MediWound shall promptly disclose to Vericel, upon its request, information in MediWound's possession required for Vericel to obtain and maintain any and all needed permits, approvals, or licenses issued by any and all Regulatory Authorities relating to the Manufacture, storage, packaging, and sale of a Product, as the case may be. MediWound shall use reasonable commercial efforts to cause Suppliers to, provide to Vericel in a reasonable, timely manner (including within a reasonable period prior to the due date of Vericel's annual report to an applicable Regulatory Authority with respect to the Product), all information in its or their respective possession which Vericel requires regarding the Product in order to comply with such Regulatory Standards. MediWound shall provide new regulatory correspondence related to the Product as soon as possible but in no event less than [***].\n\n3.7 Recall. Any decision to initiate a Recall of a Product in a country in the Territory shall be made by the marketing approval holder and shall be made in compliance with and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, after consultation between the Parties. Vericel's and its Affiliates', Sublicensees' and Distributors' costs (including internal costs of Vericel) associated with any such Recall shall be borne solely by Vericel (including refunds to customers); provided, however, that all out of pocket expenses associated with a Recall (including those of Vericel and its Affiliates, Sublicensees and Distributors and refunds to customers) shall be borne solely by MediWound to the extent such Recall (a) arises from or is caused directly by any breach by MediWound of this Agreement, the License Agreement or the Quality Agreement, or MediWound's or any of its Affiliates', Suppliers' or subcontractors' negligence or willful misconduct; or (b) resulting directly from MediWound's failure to supply Product that conforms to the applicable Product Warranty. MediWound shall cooperate in the implementation of any Recall of Product in the Territory, as required by applicable Law or reasonably requested by Vericel and, for such a Recall, the cost of such cooperation shall be at Vericel's reasonable\n\n15 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nexpense (except to the extent the Recall results from the matters described in the foregoing clauses (a) or (b)).\n\n3.8 Quality Agreement. Each Party shall perform the duties required of it pursuant to a quality agreement to be entered into by the Parties within [***] of the execution of this Agreement (the \"Quality Agreement\"). To the extent the Quality Agreement either conflicts with this Agreement or is silent on an issue addressed, this Agreement shall control, except to the extent the matter is strictly a quality matter, in which event the Quality Agreement shall supersede this Agreement solely with respect to such quality matter.\n\nARTICLE 4 CHANGES\n\n4.1 Changes. MediWound shall not change the Specifications or Manufacturing process for the Manufacture of Product for supply to Vericel for the Territory hereunder except as expressly permitted pursuant to this Article 4. Each Party shall notify the other Party of any change in the Regulatory Standards applicable to the Manufacturing of Product for the supply to Vericel for the Territory that could reasonably affect the obligations of MediWound under this Agreement. All changes shall include an assessment of the need for regulatory submission and approval by a method to be defined in the Quality Agreement. The applicable notification period for any change or proposed change by a Party to the Manufacturing process or Specifications for a Product or Key Materials, the Facility and other Manufacturing changes (the \"Change Notification Period\") is set forth on Schedule 4.1.\n\n4.2 Changes to Facility. Except as expressly permitted pursuant to Section 2.6 and this Article 4, MediWound shall not perform any change of any part of any Facility, change the physical location within the Facility for Manufacturing any Products or change the Facility at which the Manufacturing of any Products takes place, if such change would reasonably be expected to (a) impact the Regulatory Approval for one or more of the Products or any regulatory compliance program; or (b) result in inability (permanent or temporary) of MediWound to Manufacture, supply or otherwise perform its obligations per Vericel's Rolling Forecast in accordance with this Agreement. For any change in the Facility at which the Manufacturing of any Products takes place, MediWound shall (i) give Vericel notice within the applicable Change Notification Period, and (ii) provide Vericel a plan for avoiding any interruption in supply that may result from such change. In the event of a \"Major\" change to the Facility (as detailed in Schedule 4.1), such change will be treated in accordance with Section 2.6(b).\n\n4.3 Discretionary Manufacturing Changes. Vericel may propose changes to the Specifications or Manufacturing process for the supply of Product to Vericel for the Territory that are not Regulatory Changes (any such change, a \"Discretionary Manufacturing Change\"). If agreed to by MediWound, MediWound or its Suppliers will use commercially reasonable efforts to make such proposed changes, and Vericel will bear [***] of the costs associated with such changes. MediWound may propose changes to the Specifications or Manufacturing process for the supply of Product for the Territory that are not Regulatory Changes. MediWound shall propose any such Discretionary Manufacturing Change in accordance with the applicable\n\n16 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nChange Notification Period prior to the proposed implementation. [***]. Vericel shall, within [***] of receipt of MediWound's notice, notify MediWound in writing whether Vericel accepts or rejects the proposed change, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed unless consultations with regulatory authorities are required to assess the impact of such proposed change.\n\n4.4 Regulatory Changes.\n\n(a) Notwithstanding any other provision under this Agreement to the contrary, if either Party receives notice, or is otherwise informed of, any change to the Manufacturing process or Specifications for a Product or Key Materials, the Facility or any change that has an impact of the obligations of Vericel or MediWound under this Agreement that is required by applicable Law or that is otherwise required by any applicable Regulatory Authority (any such change, a \"Regulatory Change\"), such Party shall promptly deliver notice thereof to the other Party. Within the applicable Change Notification Period, MediWound shall notify Vericel in writing of MediWound's good faith and reasonable determination as to (i) whether MediWound is technically able to comply with such Regulatory Change, (ii) whether the Regulatory Change would adversely affect MediWound's ability to timely manufacture and supply any Product supplied hereunder and (iii) the costs to implement such Regulatory Change. MediWound shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Key Material Suppliers to provide such notice of any Regulatory Change to MediWound or Vericel.\n\n(b) If MediWound determines it is technically unable to comply with the Regulatory Change at the Facility in the timeframe required by the applicable Regulatory Authority, then, in MediWound's discretion, it shall have the right to transfer the Manufacturing of the applicable Product to an alternative facility of MediWound that is qualified and approved for Manufacturing such Product in accordance with this Agreement, if available. In the event MediWound is unable to supply Product as a result of such Regulatory Change, Vericel, in its sole discretion, shall be entitled to source all or any portion of Vericel's requirements of the applicable Product, until MediWound regains the ability to supply Product, from a Third Party, including from the Second Source. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if as a result of a Regulatory Change, MediWound is unable to Manufacture and supply a Product to Vericel, Vericel shall be entitled to source such Product, until MediWound regains the ability to supply Product, from a Third Party or Second Source in accordance with this Section 4.4(b), in which case MediWound shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Vericel with reasonable technical assistance with regard to transferring the technology relating to the Product to such Third Party, and the Parties shall discuss the allocation of such costs related to such transfer, including MediWound's expenses and any incremental costs of supply of such Product and Materials from such Third Party consistent with Schedule 4.5.\n\n(c) If MediWound determines it is technically able to implement a Regulatory Change required by a Regulatory Authority in the Territory, the costs for such Regulatory Change shall be borne by Vericel consistent with Schedule 4.5.\n\n17 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Ongoing Regulatory Assistance. Within [***] following Vericel's request, MediWound shall provide technical data and assistance in answering Vericel's questions (a) for regulatory filings and for process changes initiated by MediWound at no cost to Vericel, (b) for process changes initiated by Vericel at the cost of Vericel for the applicable number of hours at a Full Time Equivalent rate described in Schedule 4.5, (c) for new regulatory registrations, which shall be at Vericel's cost, and (d) for periodic regulatory reporting and questions from regulatory authorities, which shall be at the cost of Vericel.\n\nARTICLE 5  PRICE AND PAYMENT TERMS\n\n5.1 Supply Price. On a Product-by-Product basis, the price payable in U.S. Dollars by Vericel for supply of such Product for a given Calendar Year shall be as set forth on a per unit basis on Exhibit A (with respect to each Product, the \"Supply Price\"), which shall be updated on a Calendar Year basis in accordance with Section 5.2 below.\n\n5.2 Price Mechanics.\n\n(a) Beginning on [***] (each, a \"Re-Pricing Date\"), MediWound may annually increase the Supply Price for a Calendar Year in accordance with the terms of this Section 5.2. MediWound may increase the Supply Price for a Calendar Year if the United States Producer Price Index (Chemical Manufacturing) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (the \"PPI\") [***] and (b) in the event the PPI [***]. MediWound shall give Vericel at least [***] prior written notice of any such adjustment to the Supply Price.\n\n(b) In addition to the foregoing price adjustment mechanism, MediWound may propose an adjustment to the Supply Price to reflect changes that substantially affect MediWound's costs or ability to supply Product. MediWound shall provide Vericel with written notice of such changes and its proposed adjustment and provide appropriate documentation demonstrating that the price adjustment is required. Following Vericel's receipt of such notice and documentation, the Parties will engage in good faith discussions to negotiate a mutually agreed upon adjustment to the Supply Price, if any.\n\n(c) Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the adjusted Supply Price will be the Supply Price for the next applicable Purchase Order placed after Vericel's receipt of notification of the adjusted Supply Price, and shall apply to each Purchase Order placed thereafter until the next adjustment is made (if any) in accordance with the above mechanism.\n\n5.3 Cost Savings. Either Party may propose changes to any Manufacturing process in order to obtain efficiencies and cost savings in such process (\"Cost Savings Change\"). The proposing Party shall submit to the other Party a proposal detailing the Cost Savings Change, the implementation of such Cost Savings Change, and the analysis of the expected efficiencies and cost savings from such Cost Savings Change. If Vericel proposes a Cost Savings Change and (a) MediWound determines it is technically able to implement the Cost Savings Change, (b) the Cost Savings Change would not materially adversely affect the applicable Facility, and (c) Vericel agrees to pay the costs to implement such Costs Saving Change as an Additional Service Fee,\n\n18 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nMediWound shall agree to implement such proposed change which MediWound shall not unreasonably decline to implement. If MediWound proposes a Cost Savings Change and the Parties agree to its implementation, (i) Vericel shall pay MediWound the agreed amount to implement such change as an Additional Service Fee prior to the implementation of such Cost Savings Change; and (ii) MediWound shall make its reasonable commercial efforts to implement such Cost Savings Change pursuant to a mutually agreed upon schedule. In the event cost savings are actually achieved, then the cost saving will be [***] between the Parties (i.e. [***] of the cost savings shall be added to the new discounted Supply Price).\n\n5.4 Payments. Unless specified otherwise, any payment to be made by Vericel under this Agreement shall be made within [***] from date of invoice. It is hereby agreed that the invoice with respect to any shipment will be issued upon the delivery date. The Parties' respective rights and responsibilities under Sections 5.6.5 and 5.6.6 of the License Agreement shall apply as such Section pertains to the Parties' performance under this Agreement, and are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n5.5 Late Payments. Any payments due under this Agreement shall be due on such date as specified in this Agreement and, in the event such date is not a Business Day, then the next succeeding Business Day. In the event that any payment due under this Agreement is not made when due, the amount due shall accrue interest beginning on the [***] following the date on which such payment was due, calculated at the [***] for the due date, or, if lower, the maximum rate permitted by law, calculated from the due date until paid in full. Each payment made after the due date shall be accompanied by all interest so accrued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party shall have recourse to any other remedy available at law or in equity with respect to any delinquent payment, subject to the terms of this Agreement.\n\n5.6 Taxes. Vericel shall be responsible for the payment of any value added or similar tax (but excluding, for avoidance of doubt, any tax on the income of MediWound) on the Products delivered by MediWound to Vericel, to the extent such taxes are itemized and included on a valid invoice and required to be collected from Vericel under applicable Law. In addition, in the event any payments made by Vericel pursuant to this Agreement become subject to withholding taxes under the Laws or regulations of any jurisdiction or Governmental Authority, Vericel shall deduct and withhold the amount of such taxes for the account of MediWound to the extent required by applicable Laws or regulations; such amounts payable to MediWound shall be reduced by the amount of taxes deducted and withheld; and Vericel shall pay the amounts of such taxes to the proper Governmental Authority in a timely manner and transmit to MediWound an official tax certificate or other evidence of such tax obligations together with proof of payment from the relevant Governmental Authority of all amounts deducted and withheld. Any such withholding taxes required under applicable Laws or regulations to be paid or withheld shall be an expense of, and borne solely by, MediWound. Each Party agrees to cooperate with the other Party in claiming refunds or exemptions from such deductions or withholdings under any relevant agreement or treaty which is in effect.

As of the Effective Date hereof and at all times during the Term of the Agreement, each Party represents and warrants to the other Party that neither it nor, to its knowledge, any of its existing subcontractors or Suppliers, is debarred as of the Effective Date, and neither it nor any of its subcontractors or Suppliers shall, during the Term, use in any\n\n20 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\ncapacity the services of any Person debarred by any Regulatory Authority, including under Subsection 306(a) or (b) of the Generic Drug Enforcement Act of 1992 or any other equivalent Regulatory Standard.

MediWound will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Vericel, its Affiliates, Sublicensees, contractors, Distributors and each of its and their respective employees, officers, directors and agents (each, a \"Vericel Indemnified Party\") from and against any and all liability, loss, damage, expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) and cost (collectively, \"Liability\") that the Vericel Indemnified Party may be required to pay to one or more Third Parties resulting from or arising out of:\n\n(a) the material breach by MediWound of any of its representations, warranties or covenants set forth in Article 6;\n\n(b) any Recall or withdrawal of Product to the extent attributable to MediWound's breach of this Agreement or the Quality Agreement; or\n\n(c) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of MediWound or any subcontractor or Supplier acting on behalf of MediWound relating to its activities in connection with this Agreement; except, in each case, to the extent (y) caused by the negligence, recklessness or intentional acts of Vericel or any Vericel Indemnified Party or (z) Vericel is required to indemnify MediWound pursuant to Section 7.2.\n\n7.2 Indemnification by Vericel. Vericel will indemnify, defend and hold harmless MediWound, each of its Affiliates, and each of its and its Affiliates' employees, officers, directors and agents (each, a \"MediWound Indemnified Party\") from and against any and all Liability that the MediWound Indemnified Party may be required to pay to one or more Third Parties (other than shareholders of MediWound or its Affiliates) resulting from or arising out of:\n\n(a) the material breach by Vericel of any of its representations, warranties or covenants set forth in Article 6;\n\n21 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) any Recall or withdrawal of Product to the extent attributable to Vericel's breach of this Agreement or the Quality Agreement; or\n\n(c) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Vericel or any subcontractor or Supplier acting on behalf of Vericel relating to its activities in connection with this Agreement; except, in each case, to the extent (y) caused by the negligence, recklessness or intentional acts of MediWound or any MediWound Indemnified Party or (z) MediWound is required to indemnify Vericel pursuant to Section 7.1.\n\n7.3 No Right of Indemnification under License Agreement. No right of indemnification shall exist under the License Agreement for claims arising out of the performance of this Agreement, it being the intent of the Parties that such claims shall be solely governed by the provisions of this Agreement and, for the avoidance of doubt, except as set forth in Section 7.6, no limits on indemnification or liability set forth in the License Agreement shall apply to this Agreement.\n\n7.4 Procedure.\n\n(a) Notice. Each Party will notify the other Party in writing in the event it becomes aware of a claim for which indemnification may be sought hereunder. In the event that any Third Party asserts a claim or other proceeding (including any governmental investigation) with respect to any matter for which a Party (the \"Indemnified Party\") is entitled to indemnification hereunder (a \"Third Party Claim\"), then the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Party obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") thereof; provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder unless (and then only to the extent that) the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby.\n\n(b) Control. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, exercisable by notice to the Indemnified Party within [***] after receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of the commencement of or assertion of any Third Party Claim, to assume direction and control of the defense, litigation, settlement, appeal or other disposition of the Third Party Claim (including the right to settle the claim solely for monetary consideration) with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party; provided that (i) the Indemnifying Party has sufficient financial resources, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party, to satisfy the amount of any adverse monetary judgment that is sought, (ii) the Third Party Claim seeks solely monetary damages and (iii) the Indemnifying Party expressly agrees in writing that as between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be solely obligated to satisfy and discharge the Third Party Claim in full (the conditions set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above are collectively referred to as the \"Litigation Conditions\"). Within [***] after the Indemnifying Party has given notice to the Indemnified Party of its exercise of its right to defend a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall give notice to the Indemnifying Party of any objection thereto based upon the Litigation Conditions. If the Indemnified Party reasonably so objects, the Indemnified Party shall continue to defend the Third Party Claim, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, until such time as\n\n22 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nsuch objection is withdrawn. If no such notice is given, or if any such objection is withdrawn, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, at its sole cost and expense, to assume direction and control of such defense, with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. During such time as the Indemnifying Party is controlling the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate, and shall cause its Affiliates and agents to cooperate upon request of the Indemnifying Party, in the defense or prosecution of the Third Party Claim, including by furnishing such records, information and testimony and attending such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals as may reasonably be requested by the Indemnifying Party. In the event that the Indemnifying Party does not satisfy the Litigation Conditions or does not notify the Indemnified Party of the Indemnifying Party's intent to defend any Third Party Claim within [***] after notice thereof, the Indemnified Party may (without further notice to the Indemnifying Party) undertake the defense thereof with counsel of its choice and at the Indemnifying Party's expense (including reasonable, out-of-pocket attorneys' fees and costs and expenses of enforcement or defense). The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall have the right to join in (including the right to conduct discovery, interview and examine witnesses and participate in all settlement conferences), but not control, at its own expense, the defense of any Third Party Claim that the other party is defending as provided in this Agreement.\n\n(c) Settlement. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, enter into any compromise or settlement that commits the Indemnified Party to take, or to forbear to take, any action. The Indemnified Party shall have the sole and exclusive right to settle any Third Party Claim, on such terms and conditions as it deems reasonably appropriate, to the extent such Third Party Claim involves equitable or other non-monetary relief, but shall not have the right to settle such Third Party Claim to the extent such Third Party Claim involves monetary damages without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. Each of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall not make any admission of liability in respect of any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the other party, and the Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate liabilities arising from such Third Party Claim.\n\n7.5 Disclaimer. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES, AND EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS, ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE MANUFACTURE AND SUPPLY OF PRODUCT HEREUNDER), EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, ANY WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n7.6 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS) REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY OR OTHERWISE, SUFFERED BY THE OTHER PARTY, EVEN IF THAT PARTY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. [***].\n\n23 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\n7.7 Insurance. For the duration of this Agreement and for a period of [***] following its termination, each Party agrees to obtain and maintain, during the Term, commercial general liability insurance, including product liability insurance, with reputable and financially secure insurance carriers (or pursuant to a program of self-insurance reasonably satisfactory to the other Party) to cover its indemnification obligations under Section 7.1 or Section 7.2, as applicable, in each case with limits of not less than [***] per occurrence and in the aggregate. Insurance shall be procured with carriers having an A.M. Best Rating of A-VII or better.\n\nARTICLE 8  TERM AND TERMINATION\n\n8.1 Term. The term of this Agreement will commence upon the Effective Date and will continue until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Effective Date, unless earlier terminated or extended under this Article 8 (the \"Initial Term\"). At least twenty-four (24) months from the end of the Initial Term, Vericel shall provide MediWound notice whether Vericel elects to extend the Initial Term of the Agreement by an additional twenty four (24) months. After the Initial Term (including any extension thereto made in accordance with the preceding sentence), the Agreement may be extended on a yearly basis up to ten (10) years at Vericel's sole discretion, with renewal notice to be provided to MediWound no later than twelve (12) months prior to the expiry of any yearly extension (the \"Renewal Term\", and the Initial Term, together with the Renewal Term, if any, the \"Term\"); provided that unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the Term of this Agreement (including the Initial Term, any extension of the Initial Term and any Renewal Terms) shall be no more than fifteen (15) years in total.\n\n8.2 Automatic Termination. This Agreement will automatically immediately terminate in the event of the expiration or termination of the License Agreement.\n\n8.3 Termination for Breach. Subject to the provisions of Article 10 below, either Party may terminate this Agreement in its entirety if the other Party materially breaches a material provision and does not cure such breach, or does not take reasonable steps required under the circumstances to cure such breach going forward, within [***] after receiving notice of the breach.\n\n8.4 Termination by Vericel. Following the Initial Term, Vericel may, without penalty or prejudice to any other rights or remedies Vericel may have, in its sole discretion terminate or reduce the scope of any individual activities contemplated by this Agreement or any Additional Service or with respect to any Product or terminate this Agreement as a whole with or without cause, upon [***] prior written notice of such termination or reduction (which such written notice may be provided during the Initial Term).\n\n8.5 Termination by MediWound. Following the Initial Term, MediWound may terminate this Agreement by notice in writing to Vericel upon on at least [***] advanced written notice (or such longer period of time as reasonably necessary to avoid a supply disruption) if MediWound determines to cease Manufacturing the applicable Product for the Territory, but in such case MediWound will reasonably cooperate with Vericel to enable Vericel to establish its own source for the Product (including, to the extent requested by Vericel and within\n\n24 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nMediWound's ability to do so, by transferring MediWound's applicable Third Party manufacturing relationships to Vericel).\n\n8.6 Effects of Termination. Any expiration or termination of this Agreement shall not affect any claims that have accrued or outstanding obligations or payments due hereunder prior to such termination or expiration, nor shall it prejudice any other remedies that the Parties may have under this Agreement. In addition, upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement:\n\n(a) if Vericel terminates the Agreement for breach or MediWound terminates in accordance with Section 8.5, Vericel shall have the option of [***]\n\n(b) Vericel shall pay to MediWound: (i) all amounts outstanding and remaining to be paid for Product supplied prior to such expiration or termination or under any other obligation under the Agreement; (ii) all amounts for Product in the Binding Forecasts and Binding Orders prior to the expiration or termination, provided that MediWound delivers such Product in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; (iii) all amounts representing the purchase by MediWound of Materials in reliance upon the Binding Forecasts and Binding Orders (if MediWound is unable to cancel (without incurring any costs) or otherwise use such Materials); and (iv) all amounts representing remaining inventory of Product and all Product work in process undertaken in accordance with the Binding Forecasts or Binding Orders or undertaken otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\n\n(c) Following expiration of the Royalty Term (as defined in the License Agreement) for any Licensed Product in a given country, the license granted to Vericel under Section 9.1 of this Agreement with respect to such Licensed Product in such country shall automatically become fully paid-up, perpetual, irrevocable and royalty-free.\n\n8.7 Survival. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, the following terms of this Agreement shall survive: Article 1, Sections 3.2, 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6, Article 7, Article 8, Sections 9.1 and 9.2 (except in the event of termination of the License Agreement under Section 9.2, 9.3 or 9.4 thereof), Section 9.3, Article 10, and Article 11.\n\nARTICLE 9 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS\n\n9.1 Manufacturing License Grant. Subject to the terms herein, MediWound hereby grants to Vericel a non-exclusive, sublicensable (subject to Section 4.2 of the License Agreement) license under the MediWound Technology and MediWound's interest in the Joint Technology, to Manufacture and have Manufactured Licensed Products in the Territory for use in the Field in the Territory.\n\n9.2 Trademarks License Grant. MediWound hereby grants to Vericel an exclusive (even as to MediWound), sublicensable, royalty- free, fully paid-up, license in the Territory to use the Licensed Trademarks (as defined in the License Agreement) and a non- exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-free, fully paid-up, license to use the MediWound name and trademark, in\n\n25 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\neach case, in connection with the Manufacture of Licensed Products in or for the Territory. All uses of the Licensed Trademarks by Vericel (and its Affiliates, Sublicensees and Distributors) in connection with the Manufacture of Licensed Products in or for the Territory shall be in accordance with Regulatory Approvals and all applicable Laws and MediWound's quality control guidelines for the Licensed Trademarks, as may be amended from time to time. Vericel (and its Affiliates) shall only use the Licensed Trademarks licensed hereunder in connection with the Manufacture of Licensed Products in the Territory. Vericel shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates, Sublicensee and Distributors not to) use such Licensed Trademarks to identify, or in connection with the marketing of, any other products.\n\n9.1 Ownership. Ownership of all inventions and discoveries made by the Parties in the course of Manufacturing and supply of the Product hereunder (including Manufacture and supply of Product) shall be determined in accordance with the terms of the License Agreement.\n\nARTICLE 10  FORCE MAJEURE\n\n10.1 Excusing Performance. Neither Party shall be liable for the failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement to the extent such failure is due to events beyond the reasonable control of the non-performing Party, including fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, embargoes, shortages, epidemics, quarantines, war, acts of war (whether war be declared or not), terrorist acts, insurrections, riots, civil commotion, strikes, lockouts or other labor disturbances involving the workforce of any Third Party, or acts of God (a \"Force Majeure Event\"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event will not excuse or prevent a failure of MediWound to deliver Product from being deemed a \"Supply Failure\" or otherwise limit Vericel's rights, to the extent applicable, under Section 2.13.\n\n10.2 Notice of Force Majeure Event. A Party claiming a right to be excused from performance under Section 10.1 shall immediately notify the other Party in writing of the extent of its inability to perform, which notice shall specify the Force Majeure Event and the estimated likely period of time during which its performance will be affected.\n\n10.3 Resumption; Termination. A non-performing Party as a result of a Force Majeure Event shall use reasonable best efforts, at its own expense, to eliminate the Force Majeure Event and to mitigate the effect of such cause and resume performance under this Agreement, in each case, as soon as practicable and for as long as such Force Majeure Event continues. Further, consistent with diligent risk management practices, MediWound will keep current a risk management program. If MediWound is affected by any Force Majeure Event, MediWound agrees to perform its obligations under this Section 10.3 to mitigate the effect thereof and resume performance under this Agreement in the same manner as MediWound would use to resolve any similar disruptions affecting its own products (including EscharEx). MediWound shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the impact of the Force Majeure Event shall not be relatively greater for Vericel than it is for MediWound with respect to MediWound's products (including EscharEx).\n\n26 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 11  MISCELLANEOUS\n\n11.1 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any interest hereunder shall be assignable by a Party without the prior written consent of the other Party, except as follows: (a) such Party may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates, provided that the assignee shall expressly agree to be bound by such Party's obligations under this Agreement and that such Party shall remain liable for all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, and (b) either Party may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to a Third Party in connection with a permitted assignment or other permitted transfer of the License Agreement. Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party of any assignment or transfer under the provisions of this Section 11.1.

The waiver by either of the Parties of any breach of any provision hereof by the other Party shall not be construed to be a waiver of any succeeding breach of such provision or a waiver of the provision itself.\n\n11.6 Severability. If any clause or portion thereof in this Agreement is for any reason held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the same shall not affect any other portion of this Agreement, as it is the intent of the Parties that this Agreement shall be construed in such fashion as to maintain its existence, validity and enforceability to the greatest extent possible.

WORKING HOURS 5.1 The parties agree that the Executive's role and senior status are such that the Executive will determine the whole of his working time himself and his working time cannot be measured or pre-determined and, accordingly, that the Appointment falls within the scope of Regulation 20 of the Working Time Regulations 1998, meaning that the restrictions on working time set out in the Working Time Regulations do not apply to him. 5.2 During the Appointment, unless prevented by ill-health or accident and except during holiday taken in accordance with clause 11, the Executive shall devote the whole of his time, skill and attention during normal business hours, and at such other times as may be reasonably necessary (without additional remuneration), to his duties under this Agreement. 6. REMUNERATION 6.1 The Company will pay the Executive a salary of \u00a3740,000 and a fixed benefits allowance of \u00a330,000 per annum. The salary (and so far, as is reasonably possible) the benefits allowance will accrue from day to day and be payable in equal instalments in arrears on or around the 25th day of every month, less deductions for income tax and National Insurance contributions and shall be inclusive of any fees receivable by the Executive as a director of any Group Company. 6.2 The Executive's salary will be reviewed by the Compensation Committee every two years. There will be no salary review after notice to terminate this Agreement has been given by either party. The Company has no obligation to increase the Executive's salary following a review. 6.3 The Executive will be eligible to participate in any bonus or discretionary remuneration plan on such terms as the Compensation Committee may from time to time decide and always subject to the terms of the Executive Remuneration policy as approved by shareholders of WPP plc and to additional terms and conditions including the malus and clawback provisions of all relevant share or stock plans and as referred to in Schedule 2. 6.4 Any bonus payment to the Executive shall be purely discretionary and shall not form part of the Executive's contractual remuneration under this Agreement. Payment of a bonus to the Executive in 5\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\none year shall confer no right on the Executive to receive a bonus in any other year. Specifically, but without limitation, the Executive shall have no right to be considered for, or payment of, a bonus where the Executive is subject to, or may about to be subject to, an ongoing investigation or disciplinary process into facts or matters which could lead to such bonus being forfeited, or reduced and in all events if the Appointment has terminated for any reason or if he is under notice of termination whether given by the Executive or the Company at or prior to the date when a bonus might otherwise have been payable. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Executive is exonerated of any of the allegations made during any such disciplinary process or if any investigation does not result in any material action against the Executive, he will (once the disciplinary process or investigation is concluded) have the right to be considered for a bonus as if there had been no such investigation or disciplinary process. If any bonus becomes payable in such circumstances it will be paid without delay following the conclusion of the disciplinary process or investigation. 6.5 The Executive hereby irrevocably consents to the Company, at any time during the Appointment or on its termination (however arising), deducting from salary or any other payments due to the Executive in respect of the Appointment any monies due from him to the Company or any Group Company. 6.6 The Executive agrees that every benefit arising out of or in connection with his employment whilst he remains a director is subject to change (including detrimental change without compensation) where any particular benefit paid, or otherwise owing or becoming payable to him in the future, breaches or may breach the terms of the shareholder approved Executive Compensation Policy at any time. 7. EXPENSES\n\nThe Company will reimburse the Executive (on production of such evidence as it may reasonably require) the amount of all travelling and other expenses properly and reasonably incurred by him in the discharge of his duties in strict accordance with the Company's expenses policy from time to time. 8. PENSION 8.1 The Company operates a Group pension plan (the Plan). The Executive is entitled to participate in the Plan (or such pension scheme as may be established by the Company to replace the Plan), subject to its trust deeds and rules from time to time. The Executive has opted out of the Plan. Whilst his status remains so, he will receive in lieu the annual sum of 10% of his current salary, paid monthly in instalments, together with his salary. 8.2 The Company reserves the right to terminate the Plan at any time without replacing it. In this event, and assuming he is, or has been, a member, the Executive's rights (if any) will be in accordance with the said trust deeds and rules. 8.3 The Executive has been grated Fixed Protection. The Company acknowledges that once the Executive has informed the Company that he has Fixed Protection, under Regulation 5D of the Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes (Automatic Enrolment) Regulations 2010 it does not need to automatically-enrol or automatically re-enrol the Executive into a pension scheme. The Company therefore agrees not to enrol the Executive in the Plan or any other pension scheme at any time after the Executive has informed the Company that he has Fixed Protection 2016,\n\nThe Company agrees in the meantime that it will not enrol the Executive into the Plan or any other pension scheme unless it is compelled to do so by law or the parties agree in writing otherwise. If the Company is compelled to enrol the Executive into the Plan or another pension scheme under law, or the Executive opts to join the Plan or any other pension scheme the Executive acknowledges and agrees that: 6\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n(a) the Company has no liability to him if payment of any contribution to, or the provision of any benefit under, the Plan (whether by itself or when aggregated with any contribution to or any increase in value of the Executive's rights under any other arrangement) gives rise to an annual allowance or lifetime allowance charge (within the meaning of the Finance Act 2004) and that the Company has no responsibility to make any enquiry or advise the Executive as to the possibility of any such charge; (b) he is liable for reporting and paying any such charge in accordance with the Finance Act 2004; and (c) the Company has no liability to him in respect of any loss for any reason of enhanced protection, fixed protection, fixed protection 2014, fixed protection 2016 or any similar protection allowed in future (for the purposes of the Finance Act 2004) if applicable to the Executive. 9. INSURANCES 9.1 In partial spend of the fixed benefits allowance referred to in sub-clause 6.1, the Executive and his spouse or civil partner and any children under the age of 21 (or 24 if in full time education) are entitled to membership of a private medical insurance scheme. 9.2 The Executive is entitled to membership of a Group income protection plan and life assurance cover, which will be paid for by the Company. 9.3 Participation in all insurance schemes from time to time is subject to: (a) the terms of the relevant insurance scheme, as amended from time to time; (b) the rules or the insurance policy of the relevant insurance provider, or WPP Healthcare Trust as amended from time to time; and (c) the Executive (and where relevant any other potential beneficiary) satisfying the normal underwriting requirements of the relevant insurance provider and the premium being at a rate which the Company considers reasonable. 9.4 If the insurer refuses for any reason to provide the benefit to the Executive (or any relevant dependant) the Company shall not be liable to provide to the Executive any replacement benefit of the same or similar kind or to pay any compensation in lieu of such benefit. Full details of the insurance schemes are available from the Company's Worldwide Compensation and Benefits Director. 9.5 For the avoidance of doubt, the Company's sole obligations in respect of the insurance benefits referred to in sub clause 9.1 and 9.2 is to pay the premia from time to time requested by the provider and to pay to the Executive any sums as may from time to time be received by the Company from the provider in respect of any claim made by the Executive (for him or a dependent) under any insurance scheme. 9.6 The Company shall have the right at its sole discretion to alter the cover provided or any term of any insurance scheme or to cease to provide (without replacement) any insurance scheme or cover at any time. 9.7 The Executive is entitled to the benefit of any indemnity in the Company's articles of association and may also entitled to the benefit of cover under such directors and officers liability insurance policy as may be maintained by the Company from time to time. 7\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n10. SICKNESS ABSENCE 10.1 If the Executive cannot attend work due to sickness or injury, the Executive will keep the Chairman informed of his condition and, where the absence lasts for a period of seven calendar days or more, the Executive will (at the request of the Company) produce a doctor's certificate to the Company in respect of his absence. (a) Provided the Executive complies with the Company's sickness absence notification and certification requirements, the Executive shall be entitled to receive his full salary and contractual benefits during any period of sickness absence not exceeding 26 weeks in any rolling period of 12 months. These payments shall be inclusive of any Statutory Sick Pay due. No payment of salary will be made during any subsequent period of absence when the Executive is eligible to receive benefits under the Group income protection plan referred to in sub clause 9.2. 10.2 If the Company so reasonably requires, the Executive agrees to consent to a medical examination by a medical practitioner nominated by the Company, at the Company's expense. The Executive agrees that the Company may have access to reports and results produced in connection with any such examination and that it may discuss the contents of the report with the relevant medical practitioner, subject to the Executive being given the opportunity to review and comment on the report before it is disclosed to anyone within the Company. 10.3 If the Executive is absent due to illness for more than one month, the Board shall be entitled at any time thereafter to appoint an executive director or employee to perform the Executive's duties and to exercise his powers until the Executive is able to resume his duties, following which such substitute will cease to act in the Executive's role. 10.4 The Company reserves the right to terminate the Appointment under the terms of this Agreement even when this would or might cause the Executive to forfeit any entitlement to sick pay or Group income protection benefit. 11. HOLIDAYS 11.1 The Company's holiday year runs from 1 January to 31 December (the Holiday Year). The Executive is entitled to 25 days' paid holiday in addition to the usual public or bank holidays in England) in every Holiday Year, to be taken at times convenient to the Company. 11.2 No accrued but untaken holiday may be carried forward to the next holiday year and will lapse unless the Executive has been prevented from taking holiday due to sickness or statutory family leave to which he is or may be entitled further to Company policy from time to time. 11.3 The Company reserves the right to require the Executive to take any outstanding holiday during any period of notice of termination of employment or to make a payment in lieu of holiday outstanding at the Termination Date. If, at the Termination Date, the Executive has taken more holiday than he has accrued, the Executive hereby expressly consents to the Company deducting an appropriate amount from any payments otherwise due him. Deductions and payments in lieu of holiday are to be calculated on the basis that a day's holiday is equal to 1/260 of the Executive's basic salary. 12. OTHER INTERESTS\n\nDuring the Appointment, the Executive may not accept any employment with or appointment to any office, whether paid or unpaid, in relation to anybody, whether corporate or not (other than a Group Company), or directly or indirectly be interested in any manner in any other business except: 8\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n(a) as holder or beneficial owner (for investment purposes only) of any class of securities in a company if those securities are listed or dealt in on a Recognised Investment Exchange and the Executive (together with his spouse, children, parents and parents' issue) neither holds nor is beneficially interested in more than 1% of the securities of that class; or (b) with the consent in writing of the Company, which may be given subject to any terms which the Company requires. 13. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION 13.1 In this clause 13, Confidential Information means information (whether or not recorded in documentary form, or stored on any magnetic or optical disk or memory) relating, without limitation, to the business, clients, customers, products, affairs and finances of the Company or any Group Company for the time being confidential to the Company or any Group Company or in relation to which the Company or any Group Company is subject to a duty of confidentiality and trade secrets including, without limitation, technical data and know-how relating to the business of the Company or any Group Company or of any persons having dealings with the Company or any Group Company, whether or not such information (if it is not in oral form) is marked confidential, and includes, without limitation: (a) existing and prospective activities of the Company or any Group Company, including timing, business plans and financial information; (b) existing and prospective terms of business, prices and pricing strategies and structures, profit margins, trading arrangements, discounts and rebates of the Company or any Group Company; (c) existing and prospective marketing information, plans, strategies, tactics and timing relating to the Company or any Group Company; (d) existing and prospective lists of suppliers and rates of charge relating to the Company or any Group Company; (e) existing and prospective financial and other products or services, including applications, designs, technical data and qualifications relating to the Company or any Group Company; (f) existing and prospective software applications relating to the Company or any Group Company; (g) information relating to existing and prospective officers, employees and consultants of the Company or any Group Company including their engagement, their contractual terms including commission and bonuses and information relating to the termination of their employment or appointment with the Company or any Group Company; (h) any disputes and litigation proposed, in progress or settled in relation to the Company or any Group Company; (i) any invention, technical data, know-how or other manufacturing information of the Group or its customers/clients; and (j) existing and prospective research and development activities. 13.2 The Executive must not make use of or divulge to any person or entity, and must use his best endeavours to prevent the unauthorised use, publication or disclosure of, any Confidential 9\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nInformation which is disclosed or made available to the Executive, either directly or indirectly, during the course of, or in connection with, the Executive's employment or his holding any office within the Group from any source within the Company or any Group Company and shall be under an obligation promptly to report to the Group any such unauthorised use or disclosure which comes to his knowledge. 13.3 This clause 13 does not apply to information which: (a) is used or disclosed in the proper performance of the Executive's duties or with the prior written consent of the Company or any Group Company; (b) is ordered to be disclosed by a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise required to be disclosed by law; (c) is already in the public domain (other than as a result of unauthorised disclosure by the Executive or any other person); or (d) is already lawfully possessed by the Executive without any obligations of confidentiality or restrictions on use. 13.4 The Executive shall not, during the Appointment or at any time thereafter, make, except for the benefit of the Company or any Group Company, any copy, record or memorandum (whether or not recorded in writing or on computer disk or tape) of any Confidential Information and any such copy, record or memorandum made by the Executive during the Appointment shall be and remain the property of the Company and accordingly shall be returned by the Executive to the Company on the Termination Date or when required to do so by the Company. 13.5 The Executive shall not other than in the ordinary course of the Appointment without the prior written consent of the Board either directly or indirectly publish any opinion, fact or material or deliver any lecture or address or participate in the making of any film, radio broadcast or television transmission or communicate with any representative of the media or any third party relating to: (a) the business or affairs of the Company or of any other Group Company or to any of its or their officers, employees, customers, clients, suppliers, distributors, agents or shareholders; or (b) the development or exploitation of any Intellectual Property Rights, including Confidential Information. 13.6 Each of the restrictions in each sub clause above will be enforceable independently of each of the others and its validity will not be affected if any of the others are invalid. If any of those restrictions are void but would be valid if some part of the restriction were deleted, the restriction in question will apply with such modification as may be necessary to make it valid. 13.7 For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement precludes the Executive from making a protected disclosure within the meaning of Part 4A (Protected Disclosures) of the Employment Rights Act 1996. 14. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 14.1 For the purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions shall apply: (a) Intellectual Property Rights means: (i) copyrights, moral rights, patents, inventions, know-how, Confidential Information, database rights, brands, business names, domain names, 10\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nand rights in trademarks, service marks and designs (whether registered or unregistered); (ii) applications for registration, and the right to apply for registration, and registrations for any of the same, and any renewals, reissues, extensions, continuations or divisions thereof; (iii) rights to use such assets listed in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) under licences, consents, orders, statutes or otherwise; and (iv) all other intellectual property rights and equivalent or similar forms of protection now or hereafter existing anywhere in the world.

This assignment shall take effect upon the creation of each of the Intellectual Property Rights but if for any reason this does not occur, he agrees that he will hold all such Intellectual Property Rights on trust for the benefit of the Company until such time as it does. 14.4 The Executive agrees to sign all documents and to do all other acts which the Company requests (at its expense) to enable the Company to enjoy the full benefit of this clause 14. This includes joining in any application, which may be made in the Company's sole name for registration of any Intellectual Property Rights (such as a patent, trademark or registered design), and assisting the Company in defending and enforcing such rights during and after the employment (at the Company's expense). 14.5 Without prejudice to the generality of clause 13 (Confidential Information), the Executive may only use the Intellectual Property Rights and IP Materials to perform his obligations under this Agreement, and shall not disclose any Intellectual Property Rights or IP Materials to any third party without the express prior written consent of the Company. 14.6 The Executive waives all moral rights in IP Materials to which he may otherwise be entitled under the law of any relevant jurisdiction and which cannot be vested or assigned pursuant to sub clause 14.2 or 14.3.

TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT 15.1 The Appointment may be terminated by either party giving the other at least 12 months' notice in writing. 15.2 The Company may in its sole and absolute discretion (whether or not any notice of termination has been given under sub clause 15.1) terminate this Agreement at any time and with immediate effect by giving notice in writing to the Executive that the Company is exercising its rights pursuant to this clause 15. If the Company elects to terminate the Executive's employment in this way, it will make, within 30 days, either the first instalment (of equal monthly instalments) of a, or an entire, payment in lieu of notice (Payment in Lieu) equal to the basic salary, benefit allowance and any benefits, as at the Termination Date, which the Executive would have been entitled to receive under this Agreement during the notice period referred to at sub clause 15.1 (or, if notice has already been given, during the remainder of the notice period), less all relevant deductions for income tax and National Insurance contributions. For the avoidance of doubt, the Payment in Lieu shall not include any element in relation to: (a) any bonus or discretionary payment(s) that might otherwise have been due during the period for which the Payment in Lieu is made; and (b) any payment in respect of any holiday entitlement that would have accrued during the period for which the Payment in Lieu is made. 15.3 The Company may pay any sums due under sub clause 15.2 in equal monthly instalments until the date on which the notice period referred to at sub clause 15.1 would have expired if notice had been given (the Payment Period). 15.4 The Payment in Lieu is at all times conditional on the Executive informing the Company immediately in the event that he receives, or has a right to receive, remuneration from any source in respect of his employment or the provision of his services during the Payment Period or relating to the Payment Period (remuneration shall include any salary, fee or other benefit). 15.5 If the Executive obtains alternative employment or an alternative engagement during the Payment Period any further monthly instalments of the Payment in Lieu will be reduced on a pro rata basis by any payment or remuneration in respect of such alternative employment or alternative engagement during the Payment Period or relating to the Payment Period. 15.6 The Executive shall have no right to receive a Payment in Lieu unless the Company has exercised its discretion in sub clause 15.2. 15.7 Nothing in this clause 15 shall prevent the Company from terminating the Appointment in breach of contract or of common law. 15.8 If the Executive: (a) in the reasonable opinion of the Board fails or neglects efficiently and diligently to discharge his duties, including, without limitation his duties under Chapter 2 of part 10 of the Companies Act 2006, or is guilty of any serious or repeated material breach of his obligations under this Agreement and, if that material breach is remediable, fails to remedy the breach within a period of 21 days after being notified in writing to do so; (b) is guilty of any fraud, dishonesty, serious misconduct or any other conduct which, in the reasonable opinion of the Board, brings or is likely to bring the Executive or the Company or 12\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nany Group Company into disrepute or affects or is likely to affect prejudicially the interests of the Company or the Group; (c) is convicted of an arrestable offence (other than a road traffic offence for which a non-custodial penalty is imposed); (d) is guilty of any material breach or material non-observance of any code of conduct, requirement, rule or regulation referred to in sub clause 3.2; (e) becomes bankrupt or makes any arrangement or composition with his creditors; (f) is prohibited from being a director by law; (g) resigns as a director without the Company's prior consent; (h) has become physically or mentally incapable of acting as a director and may remain so for more than six months, according to a written opinion issued in relation to the Executive to the Company from a registered medical practitioner who is treating the Executive; or (i) is not or ceases to be eligible to work in the UK,\n\nthe Company may by written notice to the Executive terminate this Agreement with immediate effect. 15.9 The Company's rights under clause 15.8 are without prejudice to any other rights that it might have at common law to terminate the Appointment or to accept any breach of this Agreement by the Executive as having brought the agreement to an end. Any delay by the Company in exercising its rights shall not constitute a waiver thereof. 15.10 On the Termination Date or, at the request of the Board on either party giving notice to terminate this Agreement, the Executive will immediately: (a) deliver to the Company all other property in his possession, custody or under his control belonging to any Group Company including (but not limited to) computers and any other electronic devices, business cards, credit and charge cards, security passes, original and copy documents or other media on which information is held in his possession relating to the business or affairs of any Group Company; and (b) to the extent possible, irretrievably delete (without keeping any copies in any format) any information relating to the business or affairs of the Company or any Group Company or any of its or their business contacts from any computer or communications systems, including any website or email account, owned or used by the Executive outside the Company's premises and notify the Company of any passwords the Executive used in relation to its computer system. 15.11 If the Executive's rights or benefits under any share option or share incentive scheme in which the Executive may participate (as set out at the date hereof in Schedule 2) are affected by the termination of the Employment, his rights will be determined solely in accordance with the rules of the relevant scheme and the Executive shall not be entitled to any compensation for the loss of any rights or benefits under such scheme. 15.12 If the Appointment is terminated for the purpose of the reconstruction or amalgamation of the Company or by reason of the Company transferring all or a substantial part of its business to another company and the Executive is offered employment by the reconstructed or amalgamated or transferee company on similar terms to the terms of this Agreement, the Executive will have no claim 13\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nagainst the Company or such reconstructed or amalgamated or transferee company in respect of the termination of the Appointment. 16. GARDEN LEAVE 16.1 Following service of notice to terminate the Appointment by either party or if the Executive purports to terminate the Appointment in breach, the Board may suspend all or any of the Executive's duties and powers for such periods and on such terms as he considers expedient and this may include a term that: (a) the Executive must stay away from all or any of the Company's premises, and/or (b) will not be provided with any work, and/or (c) will have no business contact with all or any of the Group's agents, employees, customers, clients, distributors and suppliers, and/or (d) will have no access to the Company's communications systems.\n\n(referred to as Garden Leave). 16.2 During any period of Garden Leave the Company will continue to pay the Executive's salary, benefits allowance and maintain the benefits to which he is contractually entitled prior to the commencement of his Garden Leave (for the avoidance of doubt the Executive shall not be entitled to any bonus or discretionary payment(s) during any period of Garden Leave). 16.3 During any period of Garden Leave may appoint a replacement to exercise any of the Executive's duties and responsibilities and may require the Executive to take such actions as he reasonably requires to effect a proper handover of any of his duties and responsibilities. Alternatively, the Company may require the Executive to carry out exceptional duties or special projects outside the normal scope of his duties and responsibilities (provided such projects are broadly commensurate with his status). 16.4 During any period of Garden Leave the Executive's employment will continue and the Executive will continue to be bound by his obligations under this Agreement and by his general duties of fidelity and good faith (and, where applicable, as a fiduciary). The Executive agrees that the Company may, if it so chooses, announce to third parties that the Executive has resigned or been given notice (as the case may be) but the Executive will not make any comment on his status or change of duties, except to confirm he is on garden leave. 17. OFFICE AS A DIRECTOR 17.1 Any office or directorship which the Executive holds in any Group Company is subject to the articles of association of the relevant company from time to time. 17.2 The Executive is required to familiarise himself with all his responsibilities as a director, legal and/or otherwise. 17.3 Upon termination of this Agreement, or on the Board's request, the Executive will resign from any office held by him in any Group Company without any claim for compensation. 17.4 The Executive shall, at the time of signing this Agreement, appoint the Company as his attorney by executing a Power of Attorney in the form set out in Schedule 1 so that the Company can give effect to the provisions of sub clause 17.3 above and clause 14 above as required. 14\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n17.5 In the event that the Executive fails to be re-elected as a director of any Group Company, or if the Executive resigns as a director of any Group Company at the Company's request, this Agreement shall not automatically terminate and the Executive will continue as an employee of the Company unless and until either party elect to terminate the employment (either in accordance with clause 15.1, or where the Company may have a right to terminate his employment summarily under clause 15 or at common law). 17.6 The Executive must not resign from any directorship or office of any Group Company, except on termination of this Agreement (by either party), on the Board's request or as provided in the articles of association of the Company, and he must not do anything that would cause him to be disqualified from continuing to act as a director. 18. PROTECTIVE COVENANTS 18.1 The Executive acknowledges that his senior position with the Company and any Group Company gives him access to and the benefit of confidential information vital to the continuing business of the Company and any Group Company and influence over and connection with the Company's customers, clients, suppliers, distributors, agents, employees, workers, consultants and directors and those of any Group Company in or with which the Executive is engaged or in contact and acknowledges and agrees that the provisions in Schedule 3 are reasonable in their application to him and necessary but no more than sufficient to protect the interests of the Company and any Group Company. 18.2 If any person offers to the Executive any arrangement, contractual or otherwise, and whether paid or unpaid, which might or would cause the Executive to breach any of the covenants in Schedule 3, he will notify that person of the terms of that Schedule 3 and provide that person with a complete copy of it. 19. DATA PROTECTION 19.1 The Company takes its data protection obligations very seriously and complies with its legal obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation and the Data Protection Act 2018 to protect the privacy and security of the Executive's personal information. As a data controller the Company is required to inform the Executive how we hold and use his information. 20. GRIEVANCE AND DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE 20.1 If the Executive is dissatisfied with any disciplinary decision relating to him, including any decision to dismiss him, he will have the right to appeal to the Chairman of WPP plc, whose decision will be final. 20.2 If the Executive seeks to redress any grievance relating to his employment, the Executive should raise this in the first instance with the Chairman. If the matter is not satisfactorily resolved, the Executive should then apply in writing to the Board and the Board's decision will be final. 20.3 The Company may suspend the Executive from any or all of his duties for as long as is reasonably necessary to investigate any matter in which the Executive is implicated or involved, whether directly or indirectly, or in the event that the Company believes that the Executive's presence in the office would be detrimental to any investigation or to other employees or to the Executive. The provisions of clause 16.1 (a) to (d) and 16.2 will apply during any such period of suspension, with any additional terms depending on the circumstances that may be notified to the Executive in writing at that time. 15\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n21. COLLECTIVE AGREEMENTS\n\nThe Company is not a party to any collective agreement which affects the Executive's employment. 22. GENERAL 22.1 This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with English law, save where provided otherwise herein. 22.2 The parties irrevocably agree that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim that arises out of or in connection with this Agreement or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims). 22.3 This Agreement contains all the information which is required to be provided to the Executive under section 1 of the Employment Rights Act 1996. 22.4 As from the effective date of this Agreement, all other agreements or arrangements between the Company or any Group Company relating to the employment of the Executive cease to have effect.

Accordingly, it is agreed that either Party shall be entitled, without proof of special damages, to seek an injunction or other  interim remedy for any threatened or actual breach of this Clause, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies which that Party may have.     12.

The Marketing Materials will contain some or all of the           Trademarks. Reseller may include its trademarks, service marks or           other logos on the Marketing Materials; provided that Reseller may not           remove, replace or otherwise modify the Trademarks included on such           Marketing Materials.\n\n     3.3  LICENSES.

Reseller will not make an offer of\n\n                                       11\n\n          employment to any former employee of TouchStar for a period of four           (4) months after such employee leaves the employ of TouchStar. In the           event that a court of competent jurisdiction refuses to enforce all or           any portion of this Section 4.15, then such unenforceable portion will           be eliminated or modified, but only to the extent necessary to permit           the remaining portion of this Section 4.15 to be enforced. In the           event that any provisions of this Section 4.15 are deemed to exceed           the time, geographic or scope limitations permitted by applicable law,           such provisions will be reformed to the maximum time, geographic or           scope limitations, as the case may be, permitted by applicable law.\n\n5.

Nothing in this           Section 5.3 shall be construed to obligate TouchStar to provide           assistance of any kind to Reseller.

Failure by Reseller immediately to pay such Assessment may, in           TouchStar's sole discretion, result in the immediate termination of           this Agreement.\n\n     6.3  OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS. The terms and conditions of this Agreement           and of the applicable TouchStar invoice or confirmation shall apply to           all TouchStar Software and Support Services, and the installation of           call center systems, provided by TouchStar under this Agreement.

TOUCHSTAR           MAKES NO OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING THERETO.           TOUCHSTAR IS UNAWARE OF THE USE OF ANY CALL CENTER SYSTEM INSTALLED&bbsp;BY           TOUCHSTAR. TOUCHSTAR MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND           WHATSOEVER WITH REGARD TO THE USE OF ANY CALL CENTER SYSTEM, INCLUIDNG           WHETHER THE USE OF THE CALL CENTER SYSTEM CONFORMS TO APPLICABLE           FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS.

THE SOLE OBLIGATION OF           TOUCHSTAR, AND THE SOLE REMEDY OF RESELLER OR ANY OTHER RESELLER,           UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE (A) WITH REGARD TO THE TOUCHSTAR           SOFTWARE OR ANY CALL CENTER SYSTEM, THE REPLACEMENT OR REPAIR OF THE           TOUCHSTAR SOFTWARE OR THE CALL CENTER SYSTEM OR, AT THE OPTION OF           TOUCHSTAR, THE RETURN OF THE PURCHASE PRICE PAID BY RESELLER\n\n                                       14\n\n          FOR SUCH TOUCHSTAR SOFTWARE OR CALL CENTER SYSTEM AND (B) WITH REGARD\n\n\n\n\n\n          TO SERVICES, THE REPERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES.\n\n7. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.\n\n     7.1  OWNERSHIP OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.\n\n            (a) Reseller acknowledges that TouchStar owns or has rights to                 license the intellectual property and proprietary rights in, to,                 and relating to the TouchStar Software and Support Services,                 including, but not limited to, the Intellectual Property Rights.\n\n            (b) To the extent that Reseller or any Other Reseller is deemed to                 be the owner of all or any portion of the TouchStar Software,                 any Intellectual Property Rights of TouchStar or any Ancillary                 Software, or any improvements or intellectual property rights                 related thereto pursuant to applicable law, Reseller (i) hereby                 assigns exclusively to TouchStar all rights of Reseller in and                 to such Software and any improvements and intellectual property                 rights related thereto royalty-free and exclusively and (ii)                 shall include in any Other Reseller Agreement provision by which                 any Other Reseller grants to TouchStar an exclusive, perpetual,                 irrevocable, royalty-free assignment of all deemed rights of                 such Other Reseller in and to such TouchStar Software, Ancillary                 Software and Intellectual Property Rights. Reseller shall                 execute, and shall cause any Other Reseller to execute, any such                 documents and instruments necessary to vest in TouchStar the                 deemed ownership rights of Reseller or Other Reseller in and to                 any TouchStar Software, Ancillary Software or Intellectual                 Property Rights, and any improvements or intellectual property                 rights related thereto.\n\n     7.2  PRIVATE LABELING. At the request of Reseller, TouchStar shall use           reasonable commercial efforts to provide a private label version of           the TouchStar Software (the \"Private Label Software\") using logos,           trademarks, trade names or service marks owned by Reseller or to which           Reseller has exclusive rights (the \"Reseller Marks\"). Reseller           represents and warrants that Reseller has valid legal ownership and           other exclusive rights to the Reseller Marks. Reseller grants to           TouchStar a right and license to use the Reseller Marks in the           preparation of the Private Label Software. Reseller shall have the           right to promote, market, distribute and resell the Private Label           Software pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.           Reseller shall reimburse TouchStar for all costs and expenses incurred           by TouchStar in making the Private Label Software available to           Reseller. Except for the Reseller Marks, TouchStar shall retain all           right, title and interest in and to the Private Label Software.           Reseller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless TouchStar, its           Affiliates, and its and their respective directors, officers,           employees, agents and representatives from and against any and all           claims, suits, proceedings, costs and expenses arising out of or           relating to the use by TouchStar of the Reseller Marks.

Reseller shall use the           Intellectual Property Rights only to refer to the TouchStar Software           in accordance with TouchStar's policies as announced from time to           time. In particular, and without limitation, Reseller shall not (a)           remove Trademarks from any Marketing Materials, (b) include any           Trademarks or other Intellectual Property Rights in any promotional           literature prepared by Reseller without the express written consent of           TouchStar; (c) dispute or deny the validity of any of the Intellectual           Property Rights (including any attempt to register or record the same           in any jurisdiction), (d) do any act or omit to do any act whereby           TouchStar's right, title, and interest in the Intellectual Property           Rights may become invalidated or otherwise adversely affected, (e)           alter, remove, destroy, conceal, or tamper with any Trademarks, (f)           use any Intellectual Property Rights in any way which might prejudice           their distinctiveness or validity or goodwill of TouchStar therein,           (g) use in relation to Support Services any patents, copyrights,           trademarks, or trade names other than the Intellectual Property Rights           without TouchStar's prior written consent, or (h) use in the Territory           any trademarks or trade names so resembling any Trademark of TouchStar           as to be likely to cause confusion or deception. Upon expiration or           termination of this Agreement, Reseller shall immediately cease all           use of the Intellectual Property Rights and shall not thereafter use           any of them or any intellectual property rights confusingly similar to           the Intellectual Property Rights.\n\n     7.4  USE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Reseller acknowledges that it may           receive, during the term of this Agreement, certain Confidential           Information belonging to TouchStar. Reseller recognizes that such           Confidential Information is proprietary to TouchStar and very           valuable, having involved the expenditure of substantial amounts of           money and the use of skilled experts over a long period of time.           Reseller shall hold TouchStar's Confidential Information in strict           confidence and shall not use or disclose any Confidential Information,           or permit any person to examine or copy any Confidential Information,           regardless of the manner in which Reseller gained access to it, except           as necessary for the performance of Reseller's obligations under this           Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n     7.5  PROTECTION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Reseller shall protect           TouchStar's Confidential Information with the utmost care and shall           cause its employees, agents, and independent contractors having access           to such Confidential Information to sign confidentiality agreements           requiring them to comply with all the terms of this Article 7.\n\n     7.6  INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS. Reseller shall promptly notify TouchStar of any           known or suspected breach of the Intellectual Property Rights and           shall cooperate (without charge for personal time incurred) in           TouchStar's efforts to protect such TouchStar Intellectual Property           Rights. TouchStar shall defend any action brought against Reseller           based on an allegation that any TouchStar Software infringes a United           States or foreign Patent, Copyright, or Trademark, and TouchStar shall           pay all costs and damages made in settlement or awarded as a result of           any such action. If a final injunction shall be obtained in any such           action restraining use of the TouchStar Software by any Customer, or           if TouchStar believes that any TouchStar Software is\n\n                                       16\n\n          likely to become the subject of a claim of infringement, TouchStar           shall, at its option and at its expense, (a) procure for Reseller's           Customer the right to continue using the TouchStar Software, (b)           replace or modify the TouchStar Software so that it becomes           non-infringing, or (c) repurchase the TouchStar Software on a           depreciated (five-year straight line) basis. Notwithstanding the           foregoing, TouchStar shall have no obligation with respect to any           action brought against Reseller based on an allegation of Patent,           Copyright, or Trademark infringement unless TouchStar is promptly           notified by Reseller in writing of such action and is allowed complete           control of the defense of such action and all negotiations for its           settlement or compromise. This Section 7.6 states TouchStar's entire           liability with respect to infringement of Patents, Copyrights, or           Trademarks.\n\n     7.7  EQUITABLE REMEDIES. Reseller acknowledges that TouchStar will be           irreparably harmed by any breach of the provisions of this Section 7.           Therefore, in addition to any other remedies that TouchStar may have,           TouchStar shall be entitled to an injunction, issued by any court of           competent jurisdiction, wherever located, restraining any violation of           this Section 7 or specified performance if applicable. Reseller hereby           waives, with respect to any future dispute related to this Section 7,           any defense based on the argument that TouchStar will not be           irreparably harmed by a breach or that TouchStar has available to it           an adequate remedy for damages.\n\n     7.8  RESELLER'S OBLIGATIONS AS TO CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AFTER           TERMINATION. All obligations of Reseller relating to TouchStar           Confidential Information shall survive the expiration or termination           of this Agreement. Promptly upon expiration or termination of this           Agreement, Reseller shall not have a right of retention with respect           to, and shall return to TouchStar, all materials in Reseller's           possession or control that represent or contain Confidential           Information, including all memoranda, computer programs, documents,           notes, and every other medium. Reseller shall not retain for its own           use or the use of any third party any such materials or any copies           thereof.\n\n8. TERM AND TERMINATION.\n\n     8.1  TERM OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement shall continue in force for a term           of twelve (12) months from the Effective Date, unless terminated           earlier under the provisions of this Article 8 (the \"Term\"); PROVIDED           that TouchStar shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at any           time after the Effective Date upon not less than fifteen (15) days'           prior written notice to Reseller. Prior to the end of the Term, each           of TouchStar and Reseller may notify the other if it desires to           negotiate a further agreement by written request received at least           ninety (90) days in advance of the termination of this Agreement. If           both parties desire to negotiate a further agreement, they may           consider the terms of this Agreement in coming to an understanding.           Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to obligate either party           to renew or extend the term of this Agreement. Renewals for additional           terms, if any, shall not cause this Agreement to be construed as an           agreement of indefinite duration.\n\n     8.2  TERMINATION AT TOUCHSTAR OPTION.

DUTIES UPON TERMINATION.\n\n         In addition to any other provision of this Agreement which is designated in Section 8.6 as a provision surviving termination, the following shall apply:\n\n     9.1  CUSTOMER AGREEMENTS.\n\n            (a) In the event that (i) TouchStar terminates this Agreement in                 accordance with any one or more of the provisions of Section 8.2                 or (ii) Reseller elects not to enter into a new agreement with\n\n\n\n\n\n                TouchStar pursuant to Section 8.1, all Customer Agreements with                 Customers shall be transferred by Reseller to TouchStar.\n\n            (b) In the event that (i) TouchStar elects not to enter into a new                 agreement with Reseller pursuant to Section 8.2 or (ii) Reseller                 terminates this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of                 Section 8.3, Reseller shall retain all Customer Agreements with                 Customers and TouchStar shall continue to provide Support                 Services under such Customer Agreements for the remaining term                 of such Customer Agreements.\n\n&bbsp;                                      19\n\n     9.2  REFERRALS BY RESELLER. In the event that (a) TouchStar terminates this           Agreement in accordance with any one or more of the provisions of           Section 8.2 or (b) Reseller elects not to enter into a new agreement           with TouchStar pursuant to Section 8.1, Reseller shall refer to           TouchStar or TouchStar's designee all inquiries and orders received by           Reseller pertaining to the purchase of Support Services.\n\n     9.3  PAYMENT OF FEES.\n\n            (a) In the event that this Agreement terminates or expires pursuant                 to Section 8.1(a), Reseller immediately shall pay to TouchStar                 all Fees outstanding on and as of the date of termination or                 expiration of this Agreement.\n\n            (b) In the event that this Agreement terminates or expires pursuant                 to Section 8.1(b), Reseller shall continue to pay all Fees in                 accordance with the provisions of Section 6.2.\n\n     9.4  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. Reseller immediately shall stop the use           of Marketing Materials and Intellectual Property Rights, and shall           return any unused Marketing Materials and all physical media upon           which Intellectual Property Rights are contained by TouchStar.\n\n     9.5  SHIPMENTS FOLLOWING NOTICE OF TERMINATION. The expiration or           termination of this Agreement shall not relieve TouchStar of its           continuing obligation to ship TouchStar Software pursuant to any           purchase orders accepted by TouchStar prior to the notice of           termination, nor shall it relieve Reseller of its continuing           obligation to accept and pay for such TouchStar Software; PROVIDED,           HOWEVER, that with respect to all TouchStar Software shipped after any           notice of termination, Reseller shall make payment prior to shipment           on terms and conditions and by means satisfactory to TouchStar,           notwithstanding any credit terms that may have been available to           Reseller prior to such notice of termination.\n\n     9.6  LIABILITY UPON TERMINATION. TouchStar shall have no liability to           Reseller or any Other Reseller by reason of the termination or           expiration of this Agreement for compensation, reimbursement, or           damages of any kind, including any loss of prospective profits on           anticipated sales, loss of goodwill, or investments made in reliance           on this Agreement. Reseller acknowledges that it has received no           assurances from TouchStar that its business relationship with           TouchStar will continue beyond the term established in this Agreement,           or that it will obtain any anticipated amounts of profits in           connection with this Agreement, or that it will recoup its investment           in the promotion of the TouchStar Software. Reseller also acknowledges           that Reseller's failure to reach the Quotas will have a significant           adverse impact on TouchStar's goodwill in the Territory, and that if           Reseller is terminated because of failure to meet the Quotas, then           Reseller will not be entitled to compensation of any kind (beyond the           notice period set forth in this Agreement), since the damage to      &sbsp;    TouchStar's goodwill is likely to be at least as great as any losses           Reseller might incur as a result of the termination. However, these           provisions apply only to damages that are attributable to the           expiration or termination of this Agreement and shall not affect any           amount due\n\n                                       20\n\n          under this Agreement or the right of either party to seek damages           directly attributable to any breach.\n\n10.

Either party's failure to insist on strict performance of any           provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any of its           rights or remedies, nor shall it relieve the other party from           performing any subsequent obligation strictly in\n\n                                       21\n\n          accordance with the terms of this Agreement. No waiver shall be           effective unless it is in writing and signed by the party against whom           enforcement is sought. Such waiver shall be limited to provisions of           this Agreement specifically referred to therein and shall not be           deemed a waiver of any other provision. No waiver shall constitute a           continuing waiver unless the writing states otherwise.\n\n     10.6 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

Any attempted assignment in                 violation of this provision shall be void and shall be deemed a                 breach of this Agreement.\n\n     10.8 INDEMNIFICATION. Reseller shall be solely responsible for, and shall           indemnify TouchStar, its officers, directors, employees, and agents           against, and hold each of them harmless from, any and all claims           (including without limitation, all damages (whether direct, indirect,           incidental, criminal, special, or punitive), losses, liabilities,           expenses, costs, and attorneys' fees related to such claims) resulting           from (a) the negligent or willful failure of Reseller to comply with           its obligations hereunder, (b) the acts or omissions of Reseller, its           officers, directors, employees, or agents during the term of this           Agreement or thereafter, (c) any express or implied representation or           warranty made by Reseller or any of its officers, directors, employees           or agents with regard to the TouchStar Software or the Support           Services not contained in written literature of TouchStar or           specifically authorized by TouchStar in writing, and (c) the           installation of a call center system by TouchStar on behalf of           Reseller or any Other Reseller and the use of the TouchStar Software           in the operation of a call center system, unless caused by the gross           negligence or willful misconduct of TouchStar.\n\n     10.9 SECTION HEADINGS; CONSTRUCTION.

Capitalized terms used, but not defined, in this Amendment have the meanings given to such terms in the Services Agreement (as defined below). RECITALS WHEREAS, the Adviser and FASC have entered into that certain Services Agreement dated as of January 1, 2004 (as amended, the \"Services Agreement\"), pursuant to which FASC provides certain performance attribution and administration and risk management services to Adviser in connection with Adviser providing investment advisory or sub-advisory services to investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (\"1940 Act\") and/or separate accounts not required to be so registered (collectively, \"Accounts\"); WHEREAS, the Adviser and FASC have entered into the Amendment to Services Agreement dated as of March 30, 2009 (the \"Amendment\"), pursuant to which the Services indicated in Exhibit A to the Services Agreement were amended solely with respect to Accounts that are not investment companies registered under the 1940 Act, to provide that, as part of the administration and risk management services provided by FASC, FASC may provide certain coordination of client portfolios and related fixed income trade execution implementation and administration services to Adviser when Adviser is acting as adviser or sub-adviser with respect to such Accounts; and WHEREAS, the Adviser and FASC desire to amend the Services indicated in Exhibit A to the Services Agreement, as amended, solely with respect to Accounts for which the Adviser trades in equity securities, equity derivatives and other related equity investments as part of the investment strategy for the Account, to provide that FASC may provide equity trading and transaction settlement, fundamental analysis and quantitative analysis services to Adviser when Adviser is acting as adviser or sub-adviser with respect to such Accounts. NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 1. Second Amendment to Exhibit A to Services Agreement. Exhibit A to the Services Agreement shall be, and here by is, supplemented with the following: \"3. Equity Trading and Transaction Settlement. The equity trading desks execute buy and sell order based on instructions provided by affiliated advisers. The trading staff either places orders electronically or contacts brokers to place orders, find liquidity and seek price levels. Upon completion of a transaction, the transaction settlement group works with the broker and the account custodian to ensure timely and accurate exchange of securities and monies. 4. Fundamental Analysis. The equity investment analysts provide independent research and analysis of specific companies within a sector. Typically, analysis includes review of published reports, interviews of company management, on-site observation of company operations, and the use of various financial models. In addition, analysts read trade journals, attend industry conferences, and focus on trends within the sector and industry. Based on this proprietary analysis, the analyst makes buy, sell or hold recommendations to the Adviser. 5. Quantitative Analysis. Quantitative analysts develop and apply financial models designed to enable equity portfolio managers and fundamental analysts to screen potential and current investments, assess relative risk and enhance performance relative to benchmarks and peers. To the extent that such services are to be provided with respect to any Account which is a registered investment company, Categories 3, 4 and 5 above shall be treated as \"investment advisory services\" for purposes of Section 5(b) of the Agreement.\" 2. Miscellaneous. This Second Amendment shall be effective as of the date first above written upon its execution and delivery by each of the parties hereto. The Services Agreement, as amended by the Amendment and this Second Amendment with respect to Accounts for which the Adviser trades in equity securities, equity derivatives and other related equity investments as part of the investment strategy for the Account, shall remain in full force and effect. The Services Agreement, as amended by the Amendment, also shall remain in full force and effect without this Second Amendment with respect to Accounts for which the Adviser does not trade in equity securities, equity derivatives and other related equity investments as part of the investment strategy for the Account. This Second Amendment shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. This Second Amendment may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Second Amendment and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement.

Croxton   Chief Executive Officer     Chief Executive Officer   - 6 -\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit A\n\n\n\nCONFIDENTIAL TERM SHEET\n\nPROPOSED STRATEGIC ALLIANCE BETWEEN UTEK CORPORATION (UTK) & WORLD ENERGY SOLUTIONS (AVDU)\n\nStatement of Work: To identify technology acquisition opportunities for AVDU from research universities and government laboratories. A first step in this process is the development of a Technology Acquisition Profile. Once completed, we will identify and present technologies that meet this profile. While conducting our search we will maintain the confidentiality of AVDU.\n\nTerm: The term of the Agreement will be for 12 months unless terminated sooner. This Agreement may be renewed upon mutual, written agreement of the parties. Either party may terminate this agreement at any time with 30 days written notice.\n\nServices: UTK agrees to provide the following distinct services to AVDU:\n\n  i. Identify synergistic new technologies from universities and government laboratories to help provide AVDU with an enhanced new product pipeline.\n\n  ii. Review technology acquisition opportunities for AVDU while maintaining AVDU's confidentiality.\n\n  iii. Present technology acquisition opportunities for AVDU. AVDU will have 30-days to determine if they want to go forward with the technology license.\n\n  a. UTK after 30 days shall have the right to present the technology to other clients.\n\n  iv. AVDU acknowledges that the sources of technologies represented by UTEK are 3rd party research institutions for which UTEK does not control whether the technology will be shown to other parties by the licensor.\n\n  v. At AVDU's request, UTK will prepare, and compile additional information regarding the technology acquisition opportunities for AVDU.\n\n  vi. At AVDU's request and upon mutual agreement between AVDU and UTK, UTK will negotiate and seek to acquire a license to the requested technology for subsequent sale to and acquisition by AVDU.\n\n  vii. On a case-by-case basis, at AVDU's request and UTK's sole discretion, UTK will propose an equity-financing plan for AVDU's consideration, to finance select technology acquisition opportunities for AVDU.\n\n  viii. AVDU will not seek to acquire any technologies presented to AVDU by UTK directly from the technology developer for a period of 24 months following the termination of this Strategic Alliance agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n  ix. The compensation quotation is valid for projects authorized and initiated within 30 days of the date of this term sheet.\n\na. In arms length negotiation with the technology developer, UTK will seek to acquire the license to the technology through one of its subsidiaries. UTEK will then negotiate with AVDU to acquire this subsidiary in a stock for stock exchange under an \"Agreement and Plan of Acquisition\". The consideration to be paid by AVDU to UTK will be based upon a markup to the value of the license and other assets in the subsidiary as determined by UTK and agreed to by both parties.\n\nb. Should AVDU decide not to proceed in the acquisition of the technology/company as described above, then AVDU shall be prohibited from acquiring the technology/company either directly or indirectly, from the technology/company developer for a period of 24 months following the termination of this Strategic Alliance Agreement.\n\nTechnology Transfer: When a technology is shown to AVDU that AVDU wants to acquire, UTK will seek to acquire the license to a technology through one of its subsidiaries. UTK will then seek to provide a term sheet to AVDU outlining the consideration to be paid by AVDU for the acquisition of this technology. UTK shall transfer this subsidiary to AVDU in a stock for stock exchange under an \"Agreement and Plan of Acquisition.\" The consideration to be paid by AVDU to UTK will be based upon a markup to the value of the license and other assets in the subsidiary as determined by UTK and agreed to by both parties.\n\nCompensation:\n\nIn consideration for providing these Services, AVDU shall pay UTK $120,000 worth of unregistered shares of common stock (31,413 shares) upon the execution of this Strategic Alliance Agreement. 1/12th of the shares (2,617) shall vest each month during the term of this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated any unvested shares will be returned to AVDU. Both AVDU and UTK will cover their own out-of-pocket expenses incurred during the performance of this Strategic Alliance Agreement.\n\nApproved by:   /s/ Clifford M. Gross   /s/ Benjamin C.

In the event that the Company's Total Adjusted Capital (a) for each of        the Company's first, second and third fiscal quarters (as determined        based on the Company's first, second and third fiscal quarterly filed        statutory financial statements, respectively, subject to any adjustments        or modifications thereto required by the Domiciliary State's insurance        department or the Company's independent auditors) is in excess of the        Specified Minimum Percentage of the Company's projected Company Action        Level RBC (in each case as estimated by the Company as of the end of        each such first, second and third fiscal quarters, as the case may be)        or (b) as of each fiscal year end (as shown in the Company's fiscal        year-end filed statutory financial statements, together with any        adjustments or modifications thereto required by the Domiciliary State's        insurance department or the Company's independent auditors) is in excess        of the Specified Minimum Percentage of the Company's Company Action        Level RBC (as shown in such fiscal year-end statutory financial        statements), the Company shall, within the respective time periods set        forth under paragraph 4, in accordance with paragraph 5 and subject to        approval by the Company's board of directors as required by the laws of        the Domiciliary State, declare and pay dividends ratably to its equity        holders in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount        necessary to reduce the Company's projected or actual Total Adjusted        Capital as of each of the end of the Company's fiscal quarter or fiscal        year, as the case may be, to a level equal to or not materially greater        than the Specified Minimum Percentage of the Company's Company Action        Level RBC or (ii) the maximum amount permitted by the Domiciliary        State's law to be paid as an ordinary dividend less an amount that the        Company and AIG agree is appropriate to protect the Company from        exceeding such maximum amount allowed by such Domiciliary State's law as        a result of potential audit adjustments or adjustments to the        projections on which such dividend amount is based. For the avoidance of        doubt, this paragraph shall only require the Company to pay ordinary        dividends; under no circumstances shall the Company be required to pay        any dividend which would trigger the\n\n       extraordinary dividend provisions of Section 18 (S) 5005 (B) of the\n\n\n\n\n\n       Insurance Law of the Domiciliary State or that is otherwise prohibited        by the Domiciliary State. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement        does not prohibit the payment of extraordinary dividends to reduce the        Company's projected or actual Total Adjusted Capital to a level equal to        or not materially greater than the Specified Minimum Percentage of the        Company's Company Action Level RBC.\n\n    3. For the avoidance of doubt, the terms \"Total Adjusted Capital\", \"Company        Action Level RBC\", and \"Surplus to Policyholders\" shall have the        meanings ascribed thereto under the insurance laws and regulations of        the Domiciliary State, or, with respect to \"Total Adjusted Capital\" and        \"Company Action Level RBC\", if not defined therein, shall have the        meanings ascribed thereto in the risk-based capital (\"RBC\") instructions        promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners        (\"NAIC\"). The term \"Specified Minimum Percentage\" shall be equal to the        percentage set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto, which shall be        agreed to by AIG and the Company at least once every year beginning upon        the date of the filing of the Company's 2010 Annual Statement with the        Domiciliary State's insurance department and following review against        the capital adequacy standards and criteria (\"Agency Criteria\") of each        of Standard & Poor's Corp. (\"S&P\"), Moody's Investors Service        (\"Moody's\") and A.M. Best Company (\"A.M. Best\"). Notwithstanding the        obligation of the Company and AIG to review the Specified Minimum        Percentage on an annual basis, the parties hereto agree to review and        revise the Specified Minimum Percentage on a more frequent basis, if the        parties agree it is appropriate, to take into account (a) any material        changes after the date hereof to any Agency Criteria adopted by any of        S&P, Moody's or A.M. Best, on the one hand, or to the law of the        Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand,        which causes the results under the Agency Criteria to diverge from that        under the law of the Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or        instructions, (b) the Company completes a material transaction that is        treated materially differently by the Agency Criteria, on the one hand,        and the NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand, or (c) any        other material development or circumstance affecting the Company which        AIG and the Company agree merits a reevaluation of the Specified Minimum        Percentage then in effect.\n\n    4. The Company and AIG agree that any contribution to be made under        paragraph 1 will take place within the following two time periods per        year, as applicable: (a) during the time beginning on the first business        day after the filing of the Company's first fiscal\n\n                                      3\n\n       quarterly statutory financial statements and ending on the last business        day prior to the end of the Company's second fiscal quarter; and        (b) during the time beginning on the first business day after the filing        of the Company's third fiscal quarterly statutory financial statements        and ending on the last business day prior to the end of the Company's        fourth fiscal quarter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in compliance with        applicable law, any capital contribution provided for under paragraph 1        may be made by AIG after the close of any fiscal quarter or fiscal year        of the Company but prior to the filing by the Company of its statutory        financial statements for such fiscal quarter or fiscal year,        respectively, and contributions of this nature shall be recognized as        capital contributions receivable as of the balance sheet date of the yet        to be filed quarterly or annual financial statement (as the case may        be), pursuant to paragraph 8 of Statement of Statutory Accounting        Principles No. 72, to the extent approved by the Domiciliary State. The        Company and AIG further agree that any dividends to be made under        paragraph 2 will take place as soon as practicable after the filing by        the Company of the relevant fiscal quarter-end or fiscal year-end        statutory financial statements or such earlier time as may be agreed by        the Company and AIG.\n\n    5. At the time that any contribution is due under paragraph 4, AIG agrees        that it will either (a) make such contribution to the Company's direct        parent and cause such direct parent to then contribute such funds,        securities or instruments so contributed by AIG to the Company, or        (b) make such contribution directly to the Company without receiving any        capital stock or other ownership interest in exchange therefor, subject        in either case to any required regulatory approvals. At any time any        dividends are due under paragraph 4, the Company agrees that it will        make such dividend to the Company's direct parent and will use its best        efforts to cause such direct parent to then dividend or otherwise        provide such funds to AIG. All contributions and dividends contemplated        under this Agreement shall be approved, declared and made, as        applicable, in compliance with applicable law, including, without        limitation, approval by the board of directors of each applicable entity        (including the Company) and any prior notice requirements specified        under applicable rules and regulations of the Domiciliary State.\n\n    6. Subject to the requirements of applicable law and the approval, to the        extent required, by any or all of the Company's senior management,        relevant management committees, board of directors, and of any insurance        regulator, the Company hereby acknowledges that, in a manner consistent        with past practice and\n\n       any other reasonable requirements of AIG, it will comply with all        financial and budgetary planning, risk mitigation, derisking or pricing,        corporate governance, investment, informational and procedural\n\n\n\n\n\n       requirements set forth by AIG.\n\n    7. AIG hereby waives any failure or delay on the part of the Company in        asserting or enforcing any of its rights or in making any claims or        demands hereunder.\n\n    8. Unless earlier terminated in accordance with this paragraph 8, this        Agreement shall continue indefinitely. AIG shall have the absolute right        to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice        to the Company, which notice shall state the effective date of        termination (the \"Termination Date\"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that AIG agrees        not to terminate this Agreement unless (a) AIG significantly modifies        the corporate structure or ownership of the Company, or (b) AIG sells        the Company to an acquirer (i) having a rating from at least one of S&P,        Moody's, A.M. Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally        recognized statistical rating organization, that is at least equal to        the lower of (x) AIG's then-current rating from such agency or (y) the        Company's then-current rating as supported by this Agreement from such        agency; or (ii) such that, immediately on the effective date of the sale        by AIG of the Company, the Company's capitalization is consistent with        the minimum capital adequacy standards and criteria of at least one of        S&P, Moody's, A.M. Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally        recognized statistical rating organization, for a rating that is equal        to or better than the Company's then-current rating on the date        immediately preceding such sale. To the extent not terminated previously        by AIG pursuant to the foregoing, this Agreement will terminate        automatically one year after the closing of any sale of the Company by        AIG, and all provisions hereof will be of no further force and effect.        For the avoidance of doubt, the termination of this Agreement pursuant        to this paragraph 8 shall not relieve either party of any obligation it        may owe to the other party hereunder that existed prior to, and remains        outstanding as of, the Termination Date.\n\n    9. Any policyholder holding a policy issued by the Company prior to the        termination of this Agreement shall have the right to demand that the        Company enforce the Company's rights under paragraphs 1, 4 and 5 of this        Agreement, and, if the Company fails or refuses to take timely action to        enforce such rights or the Company defaults in any claim or other        payment owed to any such policyholder when due, such policyholder may        proceed directly against AIG to enforce the Company's rights under        paragraphs 1, 4 and 5 of this\n\n                                      5\n\n       Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no policyholder of the Company may        take any action authorized under this paragraph 9 unless and until        (a) such policyholder has given AIG written notice of its intent to        enforce the terms of this Agreement as provided in this paragraph 9,        which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of and basis        for the policyholder's complaint and (b) AIG has failed to comply with        this Agreement within sixty (60) days after such notice is given; and,        PROVIDED, FURTHER, that upon termination of this Agreement in accordance        with paragraph 8 hereof, the rights of any policyholder as provided for        under this paragraph 9 shall terminate effective as of the Termination        Date, except with respect to the obligation of AIG (if any) to make        capital contributions to the Company pursuant to paragraphs 1, 4 and 5        of this Agreement solely to the extent such obligation arose prior to,        and remained unsatisfied as of, the Termination Date (it being        understood that upon AIG's satisfaction of all such obligations after        the Termination Date, no such policyholder shall have any rights against        the Company or AIG, as the case may be, under this paragraph 9).\n\n    10.This Agreement is not, and nothing herein contained and nothing done        pursuant hereto by AIG shall constitute or be construed or deemed to        constitute, an evidence of indebtedness or an obligation or liability of        AIG as guarantor, endorser, surety or otherwise in respect of any        obligation, indebtedness or liability, of any kind whatsoever, of the        Company. This Agreement does not provide, and is not intended to be        construed or deemed to provide, any policyholder of the Company with        recourse to or against any of the assets of AIG.\n\n    11.Any notice, instruction, request, consent, demand or other communication        required or contemplated by this Agreement shall be in writing, shall be        given or made or communicated by United States first class mail,        addressed as follows:\n\n       If to AIG:\n\n          American International Group, Inc.           180 Maiden Lane           New York, New York 10038           Attention: Secretary\n\n       If to the Company:\n\n          American General Life Insurance Company of Delaware           c/o SunAmerica Financial Group, Inc.           2727-A Allen Parkway\n\n          Houston, Texas 77019           Attention: Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n\n       with a copy (which shall not constitute notice) to:\n\n          American General Life Insurance Company of Delaware           c/o SunAmerica Financial Group, Inc.           1999 Avenue of the Stars           Los Angeles, CA 90067           Attention: General Counsel\n\n    12.On April 24, 2011, this Agreement shall supersede and replace that        certain letter agreement, dated December 13, 1991, by and between AIG        and the Company regarding capital maintenance without the need for any        action.\n\n    13.The covenants, representations, warranties and agreements herein set        forth shall be mutually binding upon and inure to the mutual benefit of        AIG and its successors and the Company and its successors.\n\n    14.This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the        laws of New York, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of        laws.\n\n    15.If any provision of this Agreement shall be declared null, void or        unenforceable in whole or in part by any court, arbitrator or        governmental agency, said provision shall survive to the extent it is        not so declared and all the other provisions of this Agreement shall        remain in full force and effect unless, in each case, such declaration        shall serve to deprive any of the parties hereto of the fundamental        benefits of or rights under this Agreement.\n\n    16.This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties        hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all        prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations and        discussion, whether oral or written, of the parties.

Unless expressly set forth to the contrary in a Facility Addendum, Customer will issue Purchase Orders for Product no later than a period equal to the Binding Forecast Period prior to the required delivery date. By way of example only, if the Binding Forecast Period is the first three (3) months of a Forecast with respect to a Product, then Customer will issue Purchase Order for such Product no later than three (3) months prior to the required delivery date. (e) No Minimum Purchase Obligation; Minimum Order Quantities. (i) No Obligation. Without limiting Customer's obligations under Section 2.1(e), 2.4(b), 2.4(c), 2.4(d) or 2.4(e)(ii), Manufacturer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Customer is not otherwise obligated to purchase any minimum or specific quantity, volume or dollar amount of Product under any Facility Addendum unless expressly set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum. (ii) Minimum Order Quantities. Notwithstanding Section 2.4(e)(i), Customer acknowledges and agrees that (A) each Purchase Order Customer places hereunder for Product that is either API or Bulk Drug Product shall be equal to, or a whole multiple of, the Batch Size for such applicable Product as set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum and (B) each Purchase Order that Customer places hereunder for Product that is Finished Product shall be equal to or greater than the Minimum Order Quantity for such applicable Product as set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum; provided that, where Customer places Purchase Orders under (B) above that exceed the applicable Minimum Order Quantity, Customer shall -17-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nplace such Purchase Orders for such excess quantities in Increments above the Minimum Order Quantity as specified in the applicable Facility Addendum. As used herein, \"Batch Size\" means the production quantity for a given run of a Product SKU and \"Increments\" means the quantity step change above the applicable Minimum Order Quantity, in each case, as specified in the applicable Facility Addendum. (f) Acceptance and Rejection of Orders. Within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of a Purchase Order, Manufacturer may reject such Purchase Order by written notice to Customer only on the basis that it is inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, including a Purchase Order containing (i) a delivery schedule that is inconsistent with Section 2.4(d), (ii) a Product quantity that is inconsistent with Section 2.4(e)(ii), (iii) a Product quantity that is less than the Firm Order for the applicable period or (iv) subject to Section 2.4(c), a Product quantity that is more than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Forecast for the applicable period.

(g) Changes to Purchase Orders. Purchase Orders, once submitted to Manufacturer, may be amended only by mutual written agreement of the Parties; provided that Manufacturer shall exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with proposed amendments to Purchase Orders that Customer may request after sending a Purchase Order to Manufacturer. (h) Cancellations. In the event that Customer cancels all or part of a Purchase Order (provided that a cancellation shall be deemed to have occurred to the extent that Customer fails to issue a Purchase Order with respect to the full amount of Product contemplated by any portion of a Forecast with respect to the Binding Forecast Period) and such cancellation is not due to Manufacturer's breach of this Agreement or any Facility Addendum, Manufacturer will use good faith efforts to reallocate capacity and mitigate any resultant costs of such cancellation and, unless otherwise set forth with respect to the relevant cancelled Product under the applicable Facility Addendum, Customer will be charged for one hundred percent (100%) of any and all non-cancellable Third-Party costs actually and reasonably incurred by Manufacturer in accordance with this Agreement prior to cancellation for materials or services related to the cancelled portion of the Purchase Order for which reasonably acceptable documentation is submitted by Manufacturer to Customer. -18-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) Conflicts. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and any Customer Purchase Order, Manufacturer's acceptance form or Manufacturer's invoice form or any similar such forms, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern and control. (j) Product Inventory as of Effective Date. Promptly following the Effective Date, Manufacturer shall provide Customer with a Product inventory report organized by Facility, lot number, remaining shelf life, and such other data points with respect to such Product inventory as Customer may request. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) Manufacturer shall be entitled to fill Purchase Orders with such inventory that complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including Section 5.2, and (ii) the Parties shall meet to discuss in good faith the disposition of all such Product inventory that does not meet the criteria set forth in (i) above. 2.5 Failure to Supply. (a) Capacity Allocation. In the event that Manufacturer fails to manufacture and deliver Product in accordance with accepted Purchase Orders or applicable Specifications, Manufacturer shall notify Customer promptly, including details of the reasons for the failure and Manufacturer's estimated timeline of when the failure will be corrected. Manufacturer shall be solely responsible for undertaking commercially reasonable measures to minimize any shortage of Product delivered to Customer as a result of such manufacturing issues. If Manufacturer fails to manufacture and deliver Product in accordance with accepted Purchase Orders or applicable Specifications by the delivery date specified in the applicable Purchase Order(s) in accordance with Section 2.4(d), other than due to a Force Majeure Event, (i) for a period of two (2) or more months past such delivery date four (4) or more times in any rolling twelve (12) month period, or (ii) for a period of four (4) or more months past such delivery date on one occasion (each of (i) and (ii), a \"Triggering Event\"), then Manufacturer shall use its best efforts to allocate on a quarterly basis its manufacturing capacity and Product Materials to the manufacture and supply of Products for Customer on a ratable basis based on the use of each during the twelve (12)-month period immediately preceding such Triggering Event (or either (1) the Term of the applicable Facility Addendum, if the Term is less than twelve (12) months, or (2) such other period set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum); provided that (A) if Customer's Minimum Order Quantity for the applicable Product(s) exceeds its ratable allocation of manufacturing capacity or Product Materials (as applicable) for the applicable quarter, Customer shall continue to accrue its allocation of capacity until such quarter when Customer's allocation of capacity is equal to or greater than its accrued allocation of capacity and (B) this Section 2.5(a) shall not apply to the extent that Customer fails to timely provide adequate Customer-Supplied Materials or Buy-Sell Materials to Manufacturer in accordance with Section 12. For the avoidance of doubt, Manufacturer shall notify Customer promptly in writing of any anticipated Triggering Event when Manufacturer has reason to believe that such Triggering Event is likely to occur and provide such information with respect to such anticipated Triggering Event as Customer may reasonably request. -19-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Suspension of the Exclusive Purchase Requirement. In the event of a Triggering Event, Customer's Exclusive Purchase Requirement with respect to each and every Product that is the subject of the Triggering Event shall be temporarily suspended until such time as Manufacturer notifies Customer that Manufacturer is able to resume the manufacture and supply of the subject Product(s) on the terms and conditions of this Agreement (such period referred to as the \"Exclusive Purchase Requirement Suspension Period\"); provided that, (i) during such Exclusive Purchase Requirement Suspension Period, Customer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to limit its orders for the subject Product(s) to the quantities specified in the last Forecast that preceded the Triggering Event for the applicable period(s) and promptly notify Manufacturer in the event and to the extent that Customer's orders exceed such quantities specified in such Forecast and (ii) Customer shall be entitled to take delivery of Product(s) ordered during the Exclusive Purchase Requirement Suspension Period even if such delivery is scheduled for or actually occurs subsequent to the Exclusive Purchase Requirement Suspension Period. (c) Modification of the Exclusive Purchase Requirement. Upon the expiration of the Exclusive Purchase Requirement Suspension Period, Customer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resume ordering from Manufacturer, on a Product-by-Product basis, the subject Product(s) in accordance with Customer's Exclusive Purchase Requirement during the Exclusivity Period. (d) Business Continuity. Manufacturer shall maintain a written business continuity plan to be able to assure supply of Product to Customer in the event of a disruption to supply from the primary location or Facility of manufacture, including any disruption resulting from a Force Majeure Event and make such plan available from time to time upon Customer's request. (e) Remedies. Customer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement on an affected Product-by-affected Product basis immediately upon written notice to Manufacturer in the event a Triggering Event (under clause (ii) thereof) continues for more than one hundred and eighty (180) days. Customer shall also have the right to cancel orders for any quantities of Product affected by any Triggering Event effective upon notice to Manufacturer, and Customer shall have no further obligations to purchase any such cancelled quantities of Product. In the event a Triggering Event occurs during the Exclusivity Period, Manufacturer shall, at Manufacturer's cost and expense, provide such assistance as is reasonably requested by Customer to assist any alternate manufacturer in meeting Customer's requirements for the Product until Manufacturer has remedied the cause of such Triggering Event and is -20-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nable to supply Product to Customer in its requested quantities. Such assistance shall include providing, subject in all cases to Section 2.10(h), Technical Support in respect of the affected Product(s). In the event of a Triggering Event, Manufacturer shall be liable for any actual amounts that Customer is contractually required to pay to any Third-Party customer of Customer that result from Customer's inability to supply the affected Product to such Third-Party customer as a direct result of such Triggering Event; provided that (1) Customer shall provide to Manufacturer appropriate evidence of such amounts (including invoices from the applicable customers) and the applicable contractual requirements (redacted, in each case, of information pertaining to pricing and other commercial terms that are not directly related to the claimed amounts), it being understood and agreed that, upon request, Manufacturer will enter into customary confidentiality arrangements prior to such information being shared and (2) Manufacturer shall not be liable for any such amounts in the aggregate in any Fiscal Year in excess of the aggregate Conversion Cost Markup during such Fiscal Year with respect to all Products manufactured at the Facility that is the subject of the applicable Triggering Event. \"Conversion Cost Markup\" means, for a Product for any Fiscal Year, ten percent (10%) of the product of (A) Manufacturer's Standard Conversion Cost for such Product for such Fiscal Year and (B) the quantity of such Product ordered by Customer for delivery during such Fiscal Year. The rights of Customer set forth in this paragraph are in addition to any other rights set forth in this Agreement. 2.6 Delivery; Risk of Loss. (a) Delivery. Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum, Manufacturer shall deliver Product to Customer FCA (Incoterms 2010) at the applicable Facility, and all Purchase Orders will be deemed to have been completed when the quantity of Product made available to Customer at the applicable Facility is between ninety percent (90%) and one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the quantity of Product set forth in any accepted Purchase Order (each such event, a \"Delivery\"). Delivery shall occur by or within the delivery date(s) set forth in the applicable Purchase Order or such other date as may be agreed to in writing by the Parties from time to time. Without limiting Customer's rights and remedies under Section 4.8, Manufacturer acknowledges and agrees that, unless such early Delivery was agreed upon by the Parties in writing, Manufacturer shall provide Customer with such data as Customer may reasonably request from time to time for measures of key performance indicators (KPI). (b) Certificates of Compliance. Manufacturer shall include certificates of compliance and certificates of analysis with all Delivery of Product or prior to Delivery upon reasonable request of Customer. -21-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Title. Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum, title to Product and risk of loss or damage shall pass to Customer upon Delivery to Customer pursuant to Section 2.6(a). 2.7 Procurement of Materials. (a) Manufacturer shall order and maintain sufficient quantities of all Product Materials, including safety stock as required by the applicable Facility Addendum, to enable Manufacturer to manufacture and Deliver Product in accordance with its Delivery obligations under this Agreement and the applicable Facility Addendum. With respect to those Third Party suppliers of Product Materials used by Manufacturer or its Affiliates in the ordinary course in the manufacturing or supply of a given Product immediately prior to the Effective Date (\"Manufacturer Third Party Suppliers\"), Manufacturer shall be permitted to purchase solely the same Product Materials from such Manufacturer Third Party Suppliers in connection with its activities under this Agreement without first obtaining Customer's prior written consent. Any other Third-Party supplier for Product Materials (or procurement of a different Product Material from any Third-Party supplier) must be approved in advance in writing by Customer (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For the avoidance of doubt, as of the Effective Date, as between Manufacturer and Customer, Manufacturer will be solely responsible for maintaining and establishing relationships with the Third-Party suppliers of Product Materials. The costs of all such Product Materials shall be included in the Price of the applicable Product. (b) Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum for a specific Product, Customer shall have no liability for excess or obsolete Product Materials purchased by Manufacturer, (x) except as set forth in Section 2.4(h) or Section 7.9 or (y) unless the excess or obsolescence is caused by a change to the specifications for such Product Materials or the Specifications of a given Product in accordance with this Agreement after such Product Materials have been purchased by Manufacturer based upon a Firm Order or accepted Purchase Order). (c) Customer understands and acknowledges that (i) certain Product Materials have a limited shelf-life, are long lead time items, and are subject to minimum order quantities specified by the applicable supplier and (ii) Manufacturer will rely on the Firm Orders and Forecasts to order Product Materials required to meet the Firm Orders (plus safety stock for certain Product Materials of a Product as reasonably determined by Manufacturer). In addition, Customer understands that, to ensure an orderly supply of the Product Materials, Manufacturer may elect to purchase the Product Materials in sufficient volumes to meet the production requirements for Products during part or all of the forecasted periods; provided, however, that Customer shall not have any liability with respect to any purchase by Manufacturer or any of its Affiliates of labeling or packaging materials (including labels, cartons and leaflets) in excess of the amount required to meet the Firm Order applicable at such time plus the amount of applicable Product forecasted to be ordered in months four (4) through six (6) of the Forecast applicable at such time. -22-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Manufacturer must review with Customer any assessment made (or related action proposed to be taken) by Manufacturer related to rejection or destruction of any Customer-Supplied Materials, Buy-Sell Materials, Product, or Product Materials intended for Customer's Product to discuss viability for commercial use. 2.8 Product Samples.\n\nIf representative lot samples of production batches of Product are requested by Customer in order to satisfy its obligations under applicable Law, including any regulatory requirements, or to any Governmental Authority, then Manufacturer shall provide Customer (or any such Third Party as Customer shall designate) with representative lot samples of each production batch of Product promptly upon Customer's request. Customer shall be entitled to review, upon reasonable prior written notice, all manufacturing Records relating to such samples, including all analytical procedures and cleaning validation relating to the equipment used in connection with the manufacture of the samples. Such Product samples shall be Delivered to Customer (or such Third Party as Customer shall designate) in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 2.6(a) and at the Price as determined in accordance with the terms of Section 3. Customer shall pay for such samples when invoiced in accordance with Section 3.5. 2.9 Storage.\n\nManufacturer will store Products, Buy-Sell Materials, Product Materials, and Customer-Supplied Materials in accordance with the requirements of the Quality Agreement. With respect to those Third-Party warehouses used by Manufacturer or its Affiliates in the ordinary course for the storage of a given Product, Buy-Sell Materials, Product Materials, or Customer-Supplied Materials immediately prior to the Effective Date, Manufacturer may engage such Third-Party warehouse to perform the solely same activities for such Product, Buy- Sell Materials, Product Materials, and Customer-Supplied Materials under this Agreement without first obtaining Customer's prior written consent. The use of any Third Party warehouse for the storage of any Product, Buy-Sell Materials, Product Materials, or Customer- Supplied Materials other than in the manner expressly permitted pursuant to this Section 2.9 must be approved in advance in writing by Customer, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Manufacturer shall obtain the right for Customer to audit, at Customer's expense, any such Third-Party warehouse upon reasonable prior advance written notice and during normal business hours. Manufacturer has no obligation to store Product more than fifteen (15) Business Days following the requested delivery date for such Product; provided that (a) Manufacturer shall be obligated to store Product for such longer -23-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nperiod as may be reasonably necessary for Customer to arrange transportation for such Product in the event that Manufacturer experiences delays in the manufacture, release, or supply of a particular Product that results in the delivery of a quantity of Product that exceeds historical or Forecast quantities of Product for the applicable period and; (b) with respect to any Product that Customer reasonably believes should not be released by Manufacturer, Manufacturer shall store such Product until the Parties' definitive resolution pursuant to this Agreement and the Quality Agreement as to whether such Product should be released. At the expiration of the applicable time frame in the preceding sentence, notwithstanding any provision of this Section 2.9 to the contrary, Manufacturer may transport and store the subject Product at a Third-Party warehouse at Customer's expense. 2.10 Transitional Support. (a) On a Product-by-Product basis, Customer may elect, upon written notice to Manufacturer, for Manufacturer to provide Customer with reasonable technical support, as more fully set forth in this Section 2.10, to transfer production of a given Product or Products to a Customer facility or a facility of an alternative source of supply as designated by Customer (such support, \"Technical Support\" and such facility, the \"Receiving Site\"). Customer may make such election for Technical Support at any time during the Term (including in the event of a Triggering Event under Section 2.5(a) or in advance of any expiration of this Agreement) or promptly after the termination or expiration of this Agreement but in no event more than ninety (90) days following the effective date of such termination or expiration. Such reasonable Technical Support shall consist of: (i) supply of a technical package to facilitate the transfer of all relevant manufacturing information for such Product(s) to the Receiving Site, including formulation descriptions, manufacturing instructions, Specifications, methods, data required for applicable regulatory submissions and facility qualification, and material supplier information, as applicable, except for any information that is subject to confidentiality obligations owing to a Third Party; provided that the technical package will not include any manufacturing information, including formulation descriptions, manufacturing instructions, Specifications, methods and material supplier information, that is generally available to or known by the public, can be obtained on reasonable terms from Third Parties or is already available or being utilized by Customer or its Affiliate at one of Customer's or its Affiliate's facilities; (ii) host site visits to the Manufacturer's Facility by Customer to observe production of the applicable Product or Products, in each case, at a mutually agreed date and subject to confidentiality procedures or requirements as may be requested or implemented by Manufacturer; provided that the request for each such visit shall be made so as to allow for sufficient advance preparation time and can be accommodated in the requested timeframe without interruption to Manufacturer's routine production or operations; -24-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii) performance of high-level consultation and answering reasonable queries for Customer through the transfer process; and (iv) provision of reasonable Product samples required under applicable Law for transfer activities. (b) Customer shall be responsible for identifying and requesting any and all Technical Support that is required from Manufacturer to assure such technology transfer is successful. (c) The Parties shall reasonably cooperate and mutually agree to facilitate the provision of any additional reasonable Technical Support with respect to the applicable Product or Products to Customer, including assistance through the transfer process, Manufacturer Personnel visits to the Receiving Site and training and troubleshooting during the Receiving Site's first production run of the applicable Product or Products, in each case, as and to the extent reasonably agreed by Manufacturer in each instance (and subject to Sections 2.10(d), 2.10(e) and 2.10(f)). (d) The Parties will work together in good faith to plan for upcoming and ongoing Technical Support needs and to accommodate such plans in order to maintain ongoing business continuity. In addition, Manufacturer shall have no obligation to hire or retain any individuals or make any capital expenditures in connection with Technical Support, and Manufacturer's obligation to provide Technical Support is contingent upon the continued employment by Manufacturer of those individuals capable of providing such Technical Support. Manufacturer may terminate its obligation to provide any Technical Support with respect to the applicable Product under this Agreement if Customer or any of its Affiliates hires any Manufacturer Personnel involved in providing Technical Support to Customer hereunder (without limiting any applicable non-solicitation obligations of Customer pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement). (e) Customer shall be solely responsible for any and all regulatory or other Governmental Authority requirements, activities and related costs and expenses that arise in conjunction with any Technical Support, technology transfer of production or production of each Product to or at the Receiving Site. These activities may also include, but are not limited to, creation of additional data or technical information, analytical method modifications or other work of a technical nature required to support regulatory queries or contemporary standards and guidelines driven by the manufacturing transfer (subject to Section 8.2). -25-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) Subject to Section 2.5(e), Customer is responsible for, and shall promptly reimburse Manufacturer for, any and all reasonable out-of- pocket costs and expenses incurred by or on behalf of Manufacturer in connection with any Technical Support provided to Customer under this Agreement, including employee costs to be charged at a rate that reasonably approximates the cost of providing the Technical Support, without any intent to cause Manufacturer to make profit or incur loss. (g) With respect to each Product for which Manufacturer provides Technical Support under this Agreement, Manufacturer shall provide to Customer any analytical materials and methods in Manufacturer's possession or control that are required in connection with disclosures to any applicable Governmental Authority to qualify the applicable Product Materials, Buy-Sell Materials, or Customer- Supplied Materials for such Product or such Product itself for release testing to meet the then-current applicable marketing authorization, in each case, subject to Section 13. (h) Nothing in this Agreement shall require Manufacturer to provide more than 75 hours per calendar year per Product in connection with any Technical Support. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except as expressly provided in Section 2.10(g), Manufacturer shall have no obligation to disclose, license or otherwise provide confidential or proprietary information of Manufacturer, its Affiliates or any Third Party in connection with this Agreement or any Technical Support or technology transfer therein. 3. Price; Payment; Price Adjustments; Taxes. 3.1 Price. (a) Initial Price. On a Fiscal Year-by-Fiscal Year basis, Customer shall purchase each Product from Manufacturer at the Price for such Product for such Fiscal Year, as determined in accordance with the terms of this Section 3. The Price for each Product during the Initial Price Term (such Price, the \"Initial Price\" for such Product) is set forth in the Facility Addendum for such Product. Following the Initial Price Term, the Price of such Product may be adjusted only as set forth in Section 3.1(b) and Section 3.2. (b) Price in Extension Periods. In the event that Customer elects to extend the Initial Term of the Agreement or of a Facility Addendum, the Price for each applicable Product in any Extension Period shall be one hundred percent (100%) of Manufacturer's Standard Product Materials Cost plus one hundred and ten percent (110%) of Manufacturer's Standard Conversion Cost of such Product, each for the initial Fiscal Year of the first Extension Period with respect to such Product. During each Extension Period, the Price of such Product may be adjusted as set forth in Section 3.2; provided that the initial Fiscal Year of the first Extension Period shall operate as the Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year (as defined below). -26-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Subject to the limitations and conditions set forth in this Agreement, it is the intention of the Parties that the Price of each Product reflects one hundred percent (100%) of Manufacturer's Standard Product Materials Cost plus one hundred and ten percent (110%) of Manufacturer's Standard Conversion Cost of such Product. The Price for each Product will be set forth in the currency specified in the applicable Facility Addendum. (d) Changes to the Standard Cost Methodology. Manufacturer shall have the right to change the Standard Cost methodology once per Fiscal Year; provided that any change shall be consistent with the Accounting Method and applied across all products manufactured at the applicable Facility. If Manufacturer elects to change the Standard Cost methodology, Manufacturer shall calculate both (i) the revised Standard Cost using the methodology effective during the then-current Fiscal Year of the Term of the applicable Facility Addendum and (ii) the percentage change in Standard Cost caused by the change in methodology relative to the former methodology. If such Standard Cost methodology change results in an increase of Facility Conversion Cost for Products manufactured for Customer of more than two percent (2%), then Manufacturer shall revert to the former methodology for purposes of the calculation of Price during such Fiscal Year. 3.2 Price Adjustment. (a) Product Materials Adjustment. (i) On a Facility-by-Facility basis, with respect to each full Fiscal Year of the Term of the applicable Facility Addendum, the Price of each Product manufactured at the applicable Facility will be updated to reflect one hundred percent (100%) of the full estimated amount of the increase or decrease in the cost of Product Materials for each such Product. (ii) In each Fiscal Year of the Term of this Agreement, Manufacturer shall submit a report to Customer by no later than the end of the first quarter of such Fiscal Year setting out the Facility Actual Product Materials Cost with respect to each Facility for the prior Fiscal Year. In the event that the Facility Actual Product Materials Cost differs from the Facility Estimated Product Materials Cost, when adjusted to reflect actual volume, then Manufacturer shall issue either (A) an invoice to Customer for any amounts owed by Customer to Manufacturer or (B) a credit memo for amounts owed by Manufacturer to Customer reflecting the difference between the Price as invoiced and an adjusted Price for such Fiscal Year; -27-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nprovided, however, that any such adjustment made in accordance with the foregoing shall be subject in all cases to the provisions of Section 3.2(e). Customer shall pay all undisputed amounts due in the currency specified in the applicable Facility Addendum within sixty (60) calendar days from the date of the invoice. If Customer disputes all or any portion of an invoice, it shall be required to pay only the amount not in dispute, and in such event Customer shall notify Manufacturer of the amount and nature of the dispute. Payment by Customer of any amount reflected in any invoice shall not result in a waiver of any of Customer's rights under this Agreement. (b) Conversion Cost Adjustments. (i) Subject to the remainder of this Section 3.2(b), on a Facility-by-Facility basis, if the Facility Conversion Costs of a Facility during any Fiscal Year following the first full Fiscal Year of the Term of the applicable Facility Addendum (such Fiscal Year, a \"Facility Conversion Cost Adjustment Fiscal Year\") are estimated to be (a) less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the Facility Conversion Costs for the Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year (as defined below) or (b) greater than one hundred and twenty-five percent (125%) of the Facility Conversion Costs for the Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year (clauses (a) and (b) referred to collectively as the \"Facility Conversion Cost Threshold\"), when adjusted to reflect a constant volume between the Facility Conversion Cost Adjustment Fiscal Year and the Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year, then the Price for such Product will be updated beginning with such Facility Conversion Cost Adjustment Fiscal Year to reflect one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the increase or decrease in Facility Conversion Costs. An example calculation of the foregoing Price adjustment is attached hereto as Attachment G. Subject to the last sentence of Section 3.1(b), the \"Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year\" shall be, as of the Effective Date, 2019 budget volumes and costs as summarized in the applicable Facility Addenda; provided that in each instance in which the Price is adjusted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence of this Section 3.2(b)(i), the Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year shall be the applicable Facility Conversion Cost Adjustment Fiscal Year. (ii) In the event that Price is adjusted as a result of a change to Facility Conversion Cost under Section 3.2(b)(i), the Facility Conversion Cost Threshold for all remaining Fiscal Years in the Initial Term (or Extension Periods as appropriate) will be reduced such that if Facility Conversion Costs of a Facility during any Facility Conversion Cost Adjustment Fiscal Year are estimated to be (a) less -28-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nthan eighty percent (80%) of the Facility Conversion Costs for the Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year or (b) greater than one hundred and twenty percent (120%) of the Facility Conversion Costs for the Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year, then the Price for such Product will be updated beginning with such Facility Conversion Cost Adjustment Fiscal Year to reflect the full estimated amount of the increase or decrease in Conversion Cost. (iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.2(b), Manufacturer shall not have the ability to adjust the Price to reflect actual volume for Products in a Facility to the extent that Customer has reduced its demand for one or more Products in such Facility due to Manufacturer's breach of or other failure to supply under this Agreement or the applicable Facility Addendum. (iv) In each Fiscal Year following the first full Fiscal Year of the Term of this Agreement, Manufacturer shall submit a report to Customer by no later than the end of the first quarter of such Fiscal Year setting out the actual volume of Product for each Facility for the prior Fiscal Year. In the event that the actual Facility Conversion Costs demonstrate that the then applicable Facility Conversion Cost Threshold has been exceeded, and Manufacturer had not previously adjusted the applicable Price in accordance with this Section 3.2(b) to account for such adjustment, then Manufacturer shall either issue (A) an invoice to Customer for any amounts owed by Customer to Manufacturer or (B) a credit memo for amounts owed by Manufacturer to Customer reflecting the difference between the Price as invoiced and the adjusted Price for such Fiscal Year; provided, however, that any such adjustment made in accordance with the foregoing shall be subject in all cases to the provisions of Section 3.2(b)(iii). For clarity, any amount owed by Customer to Manufacturer or owed by Manufacturer to Customer shall be one hundred and ten percent (110%) of Manufacturer's Conversion Cost, reduced by a 20% allowance for variable costs. Customer shall pay all undisputed amounts due in the currency specified in the applicable Facility Addendum within sixty (60) calendar days from the date of the invoice. If Customer disputes all or any portion of an invoice, it shall be required to pay only the amount not in dispute, and in such event Customer shall notify Manufacturer of the amount and nature of the dispute. Payment by Customer of any amount reflected in any invoice shall not result in a waiver of any of Customer's rights under this Agreement. (c) Notwithstanding the above, the price for Buy-Sell Materials will be updated annually in each year following the first Fiscal Year to reflect one hundred percent (100%) of the full estimated amount of the cost of Buy-Sell Materials to Manufacturer. Customer may not change the price of Buy-Sell -29-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nmaterials during any Fiscal Year. Upon any notification by Customer to Manufacturer of any reduction in the price of Buy-Sell Materials for the upcoming Fiscal Year, Manufacturer shall submit to Customer an inventory of such Buy-Sell Materials on hand and a calculation of the positive difference between the aggregate price for such Buy-Sell Materials applying the price for the current Fiscal Year and the aggregate price for such Buy-Sell Materials applying the price for the upcoming Fiscal Year. Customer shall promptly and in no event later than sixty (60) days issue to Manufacturer a credit memo in the amount of such positive difference reflected in Manufacturer's notice. (d) The increases or decreases described in this Section 3.2 shall be determined by Manufacturer in a manner consistent with the accounting methodologies used by Manufacturer as of the Effective Date and shall be based on the applicable Forecasts provided by Customer in July of the applicable Fiscal Year and applied consistently across Manufacturer's entire manufacturing operations for the full Facility. (e) Manufacturer shall notify Customer of any estimated expected changes to Prices for the upcoming Fiscal Year by no later than June 1 of the then-current Fiscal Year and shall notify Customer of any actual changes to Prices for the upcoming Fiscal Year by no later than October 30 of the then-current Fiscal Year. Between June 1 and October 30, the Parties will engage in ongoing discussions to ensure that any final changes to Prices for the applicable Fiscal Year conform to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Manufacturer will promptly respond to Customer's inquiries regarding any proposed changes to the Price of Products and provide reasonable documentation to Customer supporting the estimated or actual change in such Prices. Any actual, adjusted Price of each Product shall become effective on the first day of the first month of such upcoming Fiscal Year. (f) Any disputes relating to changes in Price for a given Product will be resolved pursuant to Section 3.4. 3.3 Cost Improvement.\n\nAt Customer's reasonable request, Manufacturer and Customer agree to discuss in good faith the implementation of possible cost reduction opportunities with the objective to reduce the net Price of Product. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Manufacturer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to reduce the price of Product Materials. -30-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Price Review and Audit Procedure. (a) Manufacturer shall maintain complete and accurate Records that fairly reflect the relevant costs and calculations used to determine the Price of each Product and shall retain such Records for a period of not less than three (3) years after the applicable Product was manufactured and delivered hereunder. With respect to a Price change under Section 3.2 for any Product in an upcoming Fiscal Year, if Customer requests such a review in writing within thirty (30) days following notice to Customer of such change, then: (i) the Parties shall reasonably discuss and attempt to resolve any disagreement with respect thereto and (ii) if such disagreement is not resolved within thirty (30) days following commencement of such discussions, Customer shall have the right, no more than one (1) time per Fiscal Year each for the subject of (1) and (2) below and on no less than thirty (30) days' notice to Manufacturer, to appoint a reputable and internationally recognized independent Third-Party audit firm reasonably acceptable to Manufacturer (and which agrees to be bound by Manufacturer's customary confidentiality agreement) to audit such relevant Records, during normal business hours and on a confidential basis, to verify that, either (1) the change in the relevant Products' Price for an applicable Facility for the upcoming Fiscal Year, as applicable, or (2) the true-up determination with respect to (x) the estimated and actual Facility Conversion Costs of a Facility with respect to any Fiscal Year or (y) the Facility Estimated Product Materials Cost and the Facility Actual Product Materials Cost with respect to any Fiscal Year, was accurately and equitably calculated by Manufacturer in accordance with this Agreement; provided that Customer shall be deemed to have waived its right for such a review if Customer does not make such request within thirty (30) days following delivery of Manufacturer's notice to Customer of such increase. For the avoidance of doubt, any such audit initiated by Customer in accordance with clause (ii) above shall include in the scope of audit all of the Products manufactured at the applicable Facility, and not be limited in scope to the discrete Product(s) in question. Subject to Section 3.4(b)(2), Customer shall bear all costs and expenses of conducting such an audit, and such accounting firm shall work on an hourly or flat fee basis without a contingency fee or other performance or bonus fee. Such accounting firm shall, as promptly as practicable, provide in writing (I) a detailed report of such audit to Manufacturer and (II) a separate report limited to the Price for the subject Products in the relevant Fiscal Year as calculated by such accounting firm in accordance with this Agreement to Manufacturer and Customer. The Price for the Products during a Fiscal Year, as calculated by such accounting firm, absent any manifest error, shall be binding upon the Parties with respect to such increase or required payment, as applicable; provided that, within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the audit report, Manufacturer shall have the right to dispute such Price or calculation thereof by submitting written notice to Customer and the accounting firm accompanied by information supporting Manufacturer's position. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of Manufacturer's notice of dispute, the accounting firm shall issue its final findings with respect to the Price for the relevant Product in the relevant Fiscal Year and such decision, absent manifest error, shall be binding upon the Parties. -31-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) If, as a result of any audit by Customer pursuant to Section 3.4(a), the aggregate Price calculated by the accounting firm with respect to all Products manufactured at the applicable Facility for a Fiscal Year is: (i) less than ninety-five percent (95%) of the aggregate Price for all such Products established by Manufacturer pursuant to Section 3.2 for such Products during such Fiscal Year, then, if Customer has made payments to Manufacturer for such Products at the higher Price established by Manufacturer during such Fiscal Year, Manufacturer shall refund to Customer the overpayment made by Customer; or (ii) more than one hundred and five percent (105%) of the aggregate Price for all such Products established by Manufacturer pursuant to Section 3.2 for such Products during such Fiscal Year, then, if Customer has made payments to Manufacturer for such Products at the lower Price established by Manufacturer for such period, Customer shall promptly pay Manufacturer for the amount of the underpayment that should have been paid by Customer;\n\nin each case of clauses (i) and (ii), (1) such payment to be made within sixty (60) days of the owing Party's receipt of the relevant detailed report and final Price pursuant to Section 3.4(a) and (2) Manufacturer shall be responsible for payment of the applicable accounting firm's reasonable and actual fees in connection with such audit. 3.5 Invoices and Payment.\n\nManufacturer shall submit invoices to Customer upon Delivery of Product. All invoices for Products will be in functional currency unless otherwise specified in the applicable Facility Addendum, and all undisputed payments hereunder shall be in full and be made without any withholding, offset or any other deductions. Manufacturer shall include the following information on all invoices: (a) the applicable Purchase Order number and billing address; (b) the quantity of Product delivered (and where applicable, the type, description or part number, if any); (c) the required delivery date specified in the applicable Purchase Order; (d) the actual date of Delivery; (e) the Price; (f) any applicable Taxes, transportation charges or other charges provided for in the applicable Purchase Order; (g) the applicable invoice number; and (h) the Delivery Facility, unless otherwise specified in the Facility Addendum. Subject to Customer's rights under Section 4.8 to reject Non-Complying Product or Product that is not otherwise Delivered in accordance with the terms of and conditions of this Agreement, Manufacturer shall invoice Customer for Product upon Delivery of the applicable Product in accordance with Section 2.6(a). Customer shall be obligated to pay only for actual quantities of -32-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct delivered. Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum with respect to a particular Product or Products, Customer shall pay all undisputed amounts due in the currency specified in the applicable Facility Addendum within sixty (60) calendar days from the date of the invoice. If Customer disputes all or any portion of an invoice, it shall be required to pay only the amount not in dispute, and in such event Customer shall notify Manufacturer of the amount and nature of the dispute. Payment by Customer of any amount reflected in any invoice shall not result in a waiver of any of Customer's rights under this Agreement. If any payment required to be made under this Agreement is not made within twenty (20) days of the applicable date when such payment is due (the \"Late Payment Date\"), interest shall accrue on such past due amount from the Late Payment Date until the date payment is actually made at a quarterly rate equal to the lesser of (i) the Three-Month U.S. dollar LIBOR (Reuters Page LIBOR01) on the Late Payment Date (or the next Business Day if such Late Payment Date is not a Business Day), and (ii) the maximum rate permitted by applicable Law. Time for any payments hereunder shall be of the essence. 3.6 Taxes. (a) All sums payable under this Agreement are exclusive of any amount in respect of VAT. If any action of one Party (the \"Supplier\") under this Agreement constitutes, for VAT purposes, the making of a supply to another Party (or a member of that Party's Group) (the \"Recipient\") and VAT is or becomes chargeable on that supply, the Recipient shall pay to the Supplier, in addition to any amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement by the Recipient, a sum equal to the amount of the VAT chargeable on that supply against delivery to the Recipient of a valid VAT invoice issued in accordance with the laws and regulations of the applicable jurisdiction. (b) Without duplication of amounts covered by Section 3.6(a), Customer (or the applicable Affiliate) shall be responsible for all VAT, sales, goods and services, use, gross receipts, transfer, consumption and other similar Taxes (excluding, for clarity, Taxes imposed on net income, profits and gains and franchise Taxes), together with interest, penalties and additions thereto (\"Service Taxes\"), imposed by applicable taxing authorities on the direct sale of Products to Customer or any of its Affiliates or any payment hereunder; provided that such Service Taxes are shown on a valid invoice. If Manufacturer or any of its Affiliates is required to pay any part of such Service Taxes, Manufacturer shall provide Customer with evidence that such Service Taxes have been paid, and Customer (or its applicable Affiliate) shall reimburse Manufacturer for such Service Taxes. Manufacturer shall, upon the reasonable request of Customer, promptly revise any invoice to the extent such invoice was erroneously itemized or categorized. Each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) minimize the amount of any Service Taxes imposed on the provision of Services hereunder, including by availing itself of any available exemptions from or reductions to any such -33-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nService Taxes, and (ii) cooperate with the other Party in providing any information or documentation that may be reasonably necessary to minimize such Service Taxes or obtain such exemptions or reductions. If at any time Manufacturer (or any of its Affiliates) receives a refund (or credit or offset in lieu of a refund) of any Service Taxes borne by Customer (or any of its Affiliates), then Manufacturer or its Affiliate receiving such refund or utilizing such credit or offset shall promptly pay over the amount of such refund, credit or offset (net of all reasonable related out-of-pocket costs, expenses and Taxes incurred in respect thereof) to Customer or its applicable Affiliate, it being understood that Customer and its applicable Affiliate shall be liable for (x) any subsequent disallowance of such refund, credit or offset and any related interest, penalties or additions thereto and (y) any reasonable out-of- pocket costs and expenses related to such disallowance. (c) The Parties and their Affiliates shall reasonably cooperate to determine whether any Tax withholding applies to any amounts paid under this Agreement and, if so, shall further reasonably cooperate in (i) minimizing the amount of any such withholding Taxes, including by availing itself of any available exemptions from or reductions to any such withholding Taxes, (ii) providing any information or documentation that may be reasonably necessary to minimize such withholding Taxes or obtain such exemptions (including, without limitation, pursuant to any applicable double taxation or similar treaty) or (iii) receiving a refund of such withholding Taxes or claiming a Tax credit therefor. If any such withholding is required by applicable Law, the paying Party (or its applicable Affiliate) shall properly and timely withhold and remit such Taxes to the applicable taxing authority and use reasonable efforts to provide the other Party with a copy of any receipt (where it is common practice for the applicable taxing authority to provide such a receipt) or other documentation confirming such payment, and such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the receiving Party (or its applicable Affiliate). The paying Party (or its applicable Affiliate) shall not be required to \"gross up\" any amounts invoiced to the paying Party to account for, or otherwise compensate the receiving Party (or its applicable Affiliate) for, any Taxes that are required to be withheld under applicable Law. (d) Where a Party or any member of its Group is required by this Agreement to reimburse or indemnify the other Party or any member of its Group for any cost or expense, the reimbursing or indemnifying Party (or the applicable member of its Group) shall reimburse or indemnify the other Party (or the applicable member of its Group) for the full amount of the cost or expense, inclusive of any amounts in respect of VAT imposed on that amount to the extent properly reflected on a valid invoice, except to the extent that the reimbursed or indemnified Party reasonably determines that it (or such member of its Group), or a member of the same group as it (or such member of its Group) for VAT purposes, is entitled to credit for or repayment of that VAT from any relevant taxing authority. -34-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) For purposes of this Agreement, and except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, Tax matters shall be exclusively governed by the Tax Matters Agreement, and in the event of any inconsistency between the Tax Matters Agreement and this Agreement with respect to Tax matters, the Tax Matters Agreement shall control. 3.7 No Duplicative Payments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Party (or Affiliate thereof) shall enjoy a duplicative right, entitlement, obligation, or recovery with respect to any matter arising out of the same facts and circumstances. 4. Manufacturing Standards and Quality Assurance. 4.1 Quality Agreement.\n\nOn a Facility-by-Facility and Product-by-Product basis, the Parties will comply with the requirements and provisions set forth in the Quality Agreement applicable to the applicable Facility and Product, the form of which has been attached hereto as Attachment B and, through such attachment, made a part hereof. In the event of a conflict between the terms of the applicable Quality Agreement and the terms of this Agreement, the terms of the Quality Agreement shall govern and control for all quality and regulatory compliance matters and the terms of this Agreement shall govern and control for all other matters. 4.2 Manufacturing Standards.\n\nManufacturer shall manufacture and supply each Product (including disposing of all Waste and other materials) in accordance with all applicable Specifications, applicable Laws, requirements under the applicable Quality Agreement, and this Agreement. 4.3 Manufacturing Changes. (a) Discretionary Changes. Subject to Section 4.3(b), in the event that either Party desires to change, revise, modify or otherwise alter the Specifications, manufacturing processes, Product Materials, Buy-Sell Materials, Customer-Supplied Materials, or Facilities with respect to a given Product in any manner (each, a \"Manufacturing Change\"), the Party desiring the Manufacturing Change shall notify the other Party in writing of the proposed Manufacturing Change and the Parties will promptly meet to discuss, in good faith, the feasibility of implementing such Manufacturing Change and the allocation of costs between the Parties for such Manufacturing Change; provided that the requested Manufacturing Change will not be implemented unless and until the Parties mutually agree in writing to implement such Manufacturing Change. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Parties, the Party requesting the Manufacturing Change will be responsible for, and will bear the costs of, any filings or other actions that either Party must take with the applicable Governmental Authority as a result of such Manufacturing Change. -35-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Required Changes. If, at any time, a Manufacturing Change is required by a Governmental Authority in a country in which Regulatory Approval for a given Product has been granted, a Governmental Authority in a country in which Customer seeks to obtain Regulatory Approval for a given Product, or a Governmental Authority in the country in which the Facility that manufactures a given Product is located, then the Party that first has knowledge of the required Manufacturing Change shall notify the other Party in writing of such required Manufacturing Change, and Manufacturer will review such Manufacturing Change with Customer. Manufacturer will bear all costs and expenses associated with implementing the Manufacturing Change, unless such Manufacturing Change relates solely to a Product or Products manufactured for Customer (including any required labeling changes), in which case Customer will bear all costs and expenses associated with implementing such Manufacturing Change for such Product, including any changes to labeling or packaging, but only to the extent such costs are reasonable and documented. 4.4 Pest Control.\n\nManufacturer shall manufacture all Products, and Manufacturer shall store all Product Materials, Buy-Sell Materials, Customer-Supplied Materials, and all Products, in a clean, dry area, free from insects and rodents, in a manner to prevent entry of foreign materials and contamination of Product. Manufacturer's pest control measures shall include the adequate cleaning of the Facility, control of food and drink, protection of Product from the environment, monitoring of flying and crawling pests and logs detailing findings and actions taken. Manufacturer's pest control program shall be detailed in a written procedure which complies with applicable Laws, including cGMPs, and which shall be subject to review and approval by Customer. If Customer has specific concerns about procedures in place at any Facility, Customer will present such issues in its audit findings and the Parties will discuss in good faith a mutually agreeable plan for resolution of such issues. Failure of Manufacturer to comply with this Section 4.4 shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement. 4.5 Legal and Regulatory Filings and Requests. (a) Manufacturer shall reasonably cooperate with Customer in responding to all requests for information from, and in making all legally required filings with, Governmental Authorities in the Territory having jurisdiction to make such requests or require such filings. Manufacturer shall: (a) obtain and comply with all licenses, consents and permits required under applicable Laws in the Territory (and Manufacturer shall provide Customer with a -36-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\ncopy of all such licenses, consents and permits that are material upon Customer's reasonable request); and (b) comply with all applicable Laws in the Territory with respect to its manufacturing and packaging processes, the Facility or otherwise, to permit the performance of its obligations hereunder. Upon Customer's request, Manufacturer shall apply for and obtain Certificates of Pharmaceutical Production (\"CPP\") from the Governmental Authorities of the country where the Facility is located, such CPPs to be issued to countries where CPPs according to Customer's opinion are required. Manufacturer shall pay all reasonable costs necessary to obtain such CPPs and be entitled to be reimbursed against invoice by Customer at cost; provided that Manufacturer shall make good faith efforts to consolidate its invoices for such reimbursement for CPPs and submit to Customer on a Fiscal Year quarterly basis. (b) In the event that Customer wishes to extend the Territory with respect to a certain Product, Customer shall notify Manufacturer of such request and Manufacturer shall consider Customer's request in good faith. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the Parties agree to extend the Territory with respect to a certain Product, any resulting Manufacturing Change shall be treated as a discretionary Manufacturing Change and governed by Section 4.3(a). 4.6 Quality Tests and Checks.\n\nManufacturer shall perform all bulk holding stability, manufacturing trials, validation (including, but not limited to, method, process and equipment cleaning validation), raw material, in-process, bulk finished product and stability (chemical and/or microbial) tests or checks required to assure the quality of a given Product and any tests or checks required by the Specifications, the Quality Agreement, applicable Facility Addendum or applicable Laws. With respect to any Product manufactured prior to Closing or located at a Facility as of Closing, Manufacturer shall maintain, continue and complete any and all such activities, tests and checks, including, without limitation, all ongoing stability testing. All costs associated with the performance of Manufacturer's obligations under this Section 4.6 (including with respect to any Product manufactured prior to Closing or located at a Facility as of Closing) are included in the Price of each Product and, accordingly, Manufacturer shall perform the foregoing at its cost and expense, without further reimbursement from Customer. Manufacturer shall obtain Product for these tests from batches of Product manufactured under this Agreement, and Manufacturer is responsible for providing all necessary technical, quality and operational resources. All tests and test results shall be performed, documented and summarized by Manufacturer in accordance with the Specifications, Quality Agreement, applicable Facility Addendum, applicable Laws and reasonable quality assurance requirements provided by Customer to Manufacturer in writing. Manufacturer shall maintain all production Records and disposition of each batch of Product. -37-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n4.7 Responsibility for Non-Complying Product.\n\nManufacturer shall not release any Product for Delivery to Customer that does not conform to the covenants set forth in Section 5.2(e) (such non-conforming Product, \"Non-Complying Product\"), without the prior written approval of Customer. Manufacturer shall quarantine all such Non-Complying Products and shall promptly submit to Customer a report detailing the nature of such non-compliance and Manufacturer's recommended disposition, including the investigation and testing done. Manufacturer shall also provide any additional information regarding such Non-Complying Product as may reasonably be requested by Customer. Customer shall not be required to pay for any Non-Complying Product or for the destruction or other disposition thereof (unless an investigation determines that the root cause for such Product being Non-Complying Product is Non-Complying Buy-Sell Materials or Non-Complying Customer-Supplied Material). 4.8 Rejection of Non-Complying Product. (a) Customer's Ability to Reject. Customer may reject any Non-Complying Product or Product that is not delivered to Customer in accordance with this Agreement by providing written notice of such rejection to Manufacturer within seventy-five (75) days following Customer's receipt of any Delivery of Product hereunder; provided, however, that Customer may, until the expiry date for a Product, provide notice of rejection of any Delivery of such Product having (i) latent defects, (ii) any defects that are not reasonably discoverable by Customer through standard inspection and testing of Products or (iii) defects caused by the breach by Manufacturer of any of its representations or warranties under this Agreement (collectively, \"Latent Defects\"); provided, further, that, and notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer shall notify Manufacturer within sixty (60) days after Customer first becomes aware of any such Latent Defect. (b) Manufacturer's Ability to Reject. Manufacturer may reject any Non-Complying Product by (i) providing Customer with no less than sixty (60) days' prior written notice of Manufacturer's intention to reject such Non-Complying Product along with the documentation set forth in Section 4.7, (ii) meeting with Customer at Customer's request to discuss the basis for the proposed rejection of the subject Non-Complying Product, and (iii) providing Customer with notice of rejection in the event that Manufacturer rejects the subject Non- Complying Product at the end of such sixty (60) day period (or such other time frame as the parties may agree upon). (c) Manufacturer's Obligation; Replacement. Manufacturer shall respond to any rejection, defect notice or any quality-related complaint from Customer pursuant to Section 4.8(a) in a timely manner or such other time frame as may be specified in the applicable Quality Agreement. Manufacturer shall conduct an analysis of the causes of any such complaint, shall report to Customer on any corrective action taken and shall reasonably consider -38-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomer's suggestions related to such corrective action or other quality-related matters. Customer shall promptly return any Product (or portions thereof) rejected pursuant to Section 4.8(a) to Manufacturer at Manufacturer's expense. With respect to any Non- Complying Product rejected by Customer, in addition to any other rights or remedies of Customer hereunder, Customer may elect, in its sole discretion, upon written notice to Manufacturer to either (i) have Manufacturer replace any Non-Complying Product as soon as practicable at no additional charge to Customer; provided that (A) the Manufacturer shall replace such Non-Complying Product within a period of ninety (90) days beginning on the date that the Manufacturer confirms or a Third-Party laboratory determines that the subject Product is a Non-Complying Product, and (B) if Manufacturer fails to replace such Non-Complying Product within such ninety (90) day period, then a Triggering Event shall be deemed to have occurred and the provisions of Section 2.5 shall apply; or (ii) be reimbursed for the Price of the Non-Complying Product actually paid. Manufacturer shall reimburse Customer for the cost of all Customer-Supplied Materials used to manufacture any Non-Complying Product (unless such Product is a Non-Complying Product due to any Non-Complying Customer-Supplied Material, as applicable). (d) Independent Testing. If the Parties are unable to agree on whether Product rejected by Customer is Non-Complying Product, then Manufacturer may hire an independent Third-Party laboratory, subject to Customer's prior written approval of such laboratory, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, to perform testing on such rejected Product in accordance with the Specifications, applicable Laws and the Quality Agreement, which Third Party laboratory shall promptly provide the results thereof to Customer and Manufacturer. Manufacturer must engage such Third-Party laboratory within the thirty (30) day period following Manufacturer's receipt of Customer's rejection notice. If Manufacturer fails to engage such Third-Party laboratory during such thirty (30) day period, then Manufacturer will be deemed to have waived its right to engage such Third-Party laboratory. The determination of such tests shall be binding upon the Parties for all purposes hereunder; provided that, if such tests are unable to determine whether or not such rejected Product is Non-Complying Product, or if Manufacturer does not engage such Third-Party laboratory within the thirty (30) day period, then such Product shall be deemed to be Non-Complying Product. If such tests determine that the rejected Product is, or such Product is so deemed to be, Non-Complying Product, then Manufacturer shall bear the costs of such tests and Customer's remedies with respect to Non-Complying Product as set forth in this Agreement shall apply to such Non-Complying Product. Otherwise, Customer shall (i) bear the costs of such tests and shall remain obligated to pay Manufacturer the Price for such Product in accordance with Section 3 and (ii) reimburse Manufacturer for any shipping charges paid by Manufacturer pursuant to Section 4.8(c) with respect to the return of such -39-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct to Manufacturer. Without limiting the foregoing obligations, if Customer reasonably requests in writing, then Manufacturer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to re-deliver such Product to Customer at Customer's expense. For the avoidance of doubt, provided that the Product conforms to the minimum shelf-life dating set forth in Section 5.2(e)(v) upon initial Delivery, such minimum shelf-life dating requirement shall not apply to the subject Product upon re-delivery in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. (e) Survival. The provisions of this Section 4.8 shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement or the applicable Facility Addendum. 4.9 Disposal of Rejected and Non-Complying Product.\n\nAll Non-Complying Product and Product rejected pursuant to this Agreement shall be removed (if applicable) and disposed of by Manufacturer in accordance with all applicable Laws, and as approved in advance by Customer in writing (such disposal cost to be at Manufacturer's expense, unless it is subsequently determined that Customer wrongly rejected such Product pursuant to Section 4.8). Manufacturer shall make documentation relating to such disposition available to Customer upon Customer's reasonable request. Manufacturer shall not sell for salvage or for any other purpose any rejected or Non-Complying Product, without the prior written approval of Customer. Manufacturer shall destroy all Non-Complying Product prior to disposal and Manufacturer shall deface and render unreadable all words or symbols that identify Customer, including Customer's trademarks and logotypes that adorn any packaging containing such Product, prior to disposal of such Product. 4.10 Maintenance and Retention of Records.\n\nManufacturer shall maintain detailed Records with respect to Product Materials, Buy-Sell Materials, and Customer-Supplied Materials usage and finished Product production in accordance with the Quality Agreement. 4.11 Government Inspections, Seizures and Recalls. (a) Notification; Initiation of Recalls. If (i) Manufacturer determines or comes to learn that a Product distributed to the market contains a latent defect or (ii) the FDA or any other Governmental Authority conducts an inspection at Manufacturer's Facility, seizes any Product, Buy-Sell Materials, Customer-Supplied Materials, or Product Materials, requests a Recall of any Product, Buy-Sell Materials, Customer-Supplied Materials, or Product Materials, or otherwise notifies Manufacturer of any violation or potential violation of any applicable Law at the Facility, or (iii) Customer notifies Manufacturer of its intent to initiate a Recall, then, with respect to each ((i)- (iii)), Manufacturer shall promptly notify Customer (as applicable) and shall take such actions as may be required under the Specifications or Quality -40-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nAgreement. As applicable, Manufacturer shall promptly send any reports relating to such inspections, Recalls, violations or potential violations of applicable Law to Customer; provided that Manufacturer may reasonably redact any such reports to protect its confidential and proprietary Information that does not relate to Products. In the event that any such Governmental Authority requests, but does not seize, a given Product in connection with any such inspection, Manufacturer shall, to the extent reasonably practicable and permitted by applicable Law (1) promptly notify Customer of such request, (2) satisfy such request only after receiving Customer's approval, (3) follow any reasonable procedures instructed by Customer in responding to such request and (4) promptly send any samples of the applicable Product requested by the Governmental Authority to Customer. Manufacturer shall give and permit full and unrestricted access to all or any of its premises at any time to any authorized representative of any Governmental Authority or any of its agents or advisers and shall cooperate fully with any such representatives, in each case, relating to any such inspection. Manufacturer shall not initiate any Recall of Product, except as provided in the Quality Agreement, without the prior written agreement by Customer. (b) Costs. In the event a Recall results from any breach by Manufacturer of this Agreement, including Recalls on account of a given Product containing a latent defect, in addition to any other rights or remedies available to Customer under this Agreement, Manufacturer shall reimburse Customer for Customer's costs and expenses associated with such Recall, including costs of materials supplied by Customer (including Customer-Supplied Materials), shipping costs, administrative costs associated with arranging and coordinating the Recall and all actual Third Party costs associated with the distribution of replacement Product; provided that Customer shall be solely responsible for all, and shall reimburse Manufacturer for Manufacturer's costs and expenses associated with any Recall to the extent such Recall does not result from a breach by Manufacturer of this Agreement (e.g., is due to any Non- Complying Customer-Supplied Material or Non-Complying Buy-Sell Material). 4.12 Inspections.\n\nSubject to the remainder of this Section 4.12, no more than once per calendar year, upon thirty (30) days' advance written notice to Manufacturer, Customer may physically inspect or audit (consistent with Section 15.2) the Facilities under this Section 4.12; provided that Customer will use good faith efforts to choose dates of inspection or audit that do not unreasonably interfere with the operation of Manufacturer's business; provided, further, that Customer shall consider in good faith any alternative dates of inspection or audit proposed by Manufacturer within five (5) days of Manufacturer's receipt of such notice (it being understood that nothing in this Section 4.12 shall require Customer to accept any such proposed alternative dates of inspection or audit). Notwithstanding the limits set forth in the -41-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nforegoing sentence, Customer may more frequently conduct \"for cause\" physical inspections or audits of a Facility with five (5) days' advance written notice to Manufacturer if Customer has reasonable cause to believe that an inspection or audit of such Facility is warranted because Manufacturer's activities with respect to such Facility are in breach of this Agreement, applicable Laws, the Quality Agreement or the applicable Facility Addendum. Any such inspection or audit shall include access to relevant Records (subject to the terms of Section 15.2) and Personnel and being present during, as applicable, start-up manufacturing operations, validation, cleaning, sampling, laboratory testing, warehouse receiving and storage, pack out and shipping. Manufacturer shall provide technical assistance and direction to Customer and its representatives at the Facility. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, Customer may conduct, at its own expense, periodic quality audits, to ensure Manufacturer's compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Manufacturer shall cooperate with Customer's representatives for all of these purposes, and shall promptly correct any deficiencies noted during the audits. Any Records or information accessed or otherwise obtained by Customer or its representatives during any such inspection or audit or any visit at any Facility shall be deemed Manufacturer's confidential and proprietary Information and each representative of Customer will be subject to non-use and other confidentiality obligations substantially comparable to those set forth herein for Customer. 4.13 Segregation of Restricted Compounds.\n\nUnless otherwise set forth in a Facility Addendum with respect to a Product, Manufacturer shall not manufacture a Product using facilities or equipment shared with the following classes of product without prior consultation and agreement with Customer: (a) steroids, hormones, or otherwise highly active or toxic products that carry a likelihood of a serious adverse effect (e.g., carcinogenicity; anaphylaxis; reproductive and/or developmental toxicity; serious target organ toxicity) following a potential product cross-contamination or carry-over scenario, particularly at low exposure concentrations (i.e., with reference to an acceptable daily exposure (ADE) value or permitted daily exposure (PDE) value < 10 \u00b5g/day); (b) immunosuppressors where the ADE or PDE value < 10 \u00b5g/day; (c) live or infectious biological agents; (d) live or attenuated vaccines; (e) biotherapeutics where the ADE or PDE value < 10 \u00b5g/day and sufficient deactivation cannot be demonstrated; (f) products exclusive for animal use; (g) non-medicinal products; or (h) radiopharmaceuticals. Manufacturer shall not manufacture any highly sensitizing products, including beta-lactam antibiotics, as well as certain non-beta-lactam antibiotics, or otherwise highly sensitizing products that can elicit an immediate hypersensitivity reaction (Type I hypersensitivity; immunoglobulin E-mediated) in the same Facility as a Product. -42-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n4.14 Packaging Material.\n\nUnless otherwise provided in the applicable Facility Addendum, Customer shall determine and be responsible for the text (including any logos or other graphics) for all packaging material used in connection with Product.

Furthermore, Customer shall not be liable for Losses pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(iii) above to the extent such infringement or misappropriation is caused by Manufacturer's unauthorized use or unauthorized modification of any Customer Property, Customer- Owned Improvements and Developments, Buy-Sell Materials or Customer-Supplied Materials. 10.3 Indemnification Procedures. (a) If, at or following the date of this Agreement, any Person entitled to be indemnified under this Section 10 (the \"Indemnitee\") shall receive notice or otherwise learn of the assertion by a Person (including any Governmental Authority) who is not a member of the Pluto Group or the Spinco Group of any claim or of the commencement by any such Person of any Action with respect to which the Party from whom indemnification may be sought under this Section 10 (the \"Indemnifying Party\") (such claim, a \"Third-Party Claim\"), such Indemnitee shall give such Indemnifying Party written notice thereof as promptly as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days (or sooner if the nature of the Third-Party Claim so requires) after becoming aware of such Third-Party Claim. Any such notice shall describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail, including the facts and circumstances giving rise to such claim for indemnification, and include copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnitee relating to the Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of any Indemnitee to provide notice as provided in this Section 10.3(a) shall not relieve an Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Section 10, except to the extent, and only to the extent, that such Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice in accordance with this Section 10.3(a). (b) An Indemnifying Party may elect (but shall not be required) to defend (and seek to settle or compromise), at such Indemnifying Party's own expense and by such Indemnifying Party's own counsel (which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee), any Third-Party Claim; provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to defend such Third-Party Claim and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of one separate -60-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\ncounsel for all Indemnitees if the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal action, indictment or allegation or if such Third-Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnitee (and not any Indemnifying Party or any of its Affiliates). Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of notice from an Indemnitee in accordance with Section 10.3(a) (or sooner, if the nature of such Third-Party Claim so requires), the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnitee of its election whether the Indemnifying Party will assume responsibility for defending such Third-Party Claim, which election shall specify any reservations or exceptions to its defense. After notice from an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, such Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense, compromise, or settlement thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be the expense of such Indemnitee; provided, however, in the event that the Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim but has specified, and continues to assert, any reservations or exceptions in such notice, then, in such case, the reasonable fees and expenses of one separate counsel for all Indemnitees shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party; and provided further that the Indemnifying Party will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel if, based on the reasonable opinion of legal counsel to the Indemnitee, a conflict or potential conflict of interest exists between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee which makes representation of both parties inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct. (c) If an Indemnifying Party elects not to assume responsibility for defending a Third-Party Claim, or fails to notify an Indemnitee of its election as provided in Section 10.3(b), then the applicable Indemnitee may defend such Third-Party Claim at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party to the extent indemnification is available under the terms of this Agreement. If an Indemnifying Party elects not to assume responsibility for defending a Third-Party Claim, or fails to notify an Indemnitee of its election as provided in Section 10.3(b), then, it shall not be a defense to any obligation of the Indemnifying Party to pay any amount in respect of such Third-Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party was not consulted in the defense thereof, that such Indemnifying Party's views or opinions as to the conduct of such defense were not accepted or adopted, that such Indemnifying Party does not approve of the quality or manner of the defense thereof or, subject to Section 10.3(d), that such Third-Party Claim was incurred by reason of a settlement rather than by a judgment or other determination of liability. (d) Neither Party may settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim for which either Party is seeking to be indemnified hereunder without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless such settlement or compromise is solely for monetary damages that are fully payable by the settling or compromising party, does not involve any admission, finding or determination of wrongdoing or violation of Law by the other Party and provides for a full, unconditional and irrevocable release of the other Party from all Liability in connection with the Third-Party Claim. -61-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n10.4 Limitations on Liability.

(a) The Parties intend that any Loss subject to indemnification or reimbursement pursuant to this Section 10 will be net of Insurance Proceeds or other amounts actually recovered (net of any out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred in the collection thereof) from any Person by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in respect of any indemnifiable Liability. Accordingly, the amount that any Indemnifying Party is required to pay to any Indemnitee will be reduced by any Insurance Proceeds or other amounts actually recovered (net of any out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred in the collection thereof) from any Person by or on behalf of such Indemnitee in respect of the related Loss. If an Indemnitee receives a payment (an \"Indemnity Payment\") required by this Agreement from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Loss and subsequently receives Insurance Proceeds or any other amounts in respect of the related Loss, then the Indemnitee will pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the excess of the Indemnity Payment received over the amount of the Indemnity Payment that would have been due if the Insurance Proceeds or such other amounts (net of any out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred in the collection thereof) had been received, realized or recovered before the Indemnity Payment was made. (b) An insurer that would otherwise be obligated to pay any claim shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto or, solely by virtue of any provisions contained in this Agreement, have any subrogation rights with respect thereto, it being expressly understood and agreed that no insurer or any other Third Party shall be entitled to a \"wind-fall\" (i.e., a benefit that such insurer or other Third Party would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the indemnification provisions) by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof. Each Party shall, and shall cause the members of its Group to, use commercially reasonable efforts (taking into account the probability of success on the merits and the cost of expending such efforts, including attorneys' fees and expenses) to collect or recover any Insurance Proceeds that may be collectible or recoverable respecting the Liabilities for which indemnification may be available under this Section 10. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnifying Party may not delay making any indemnification payment required under the terms of this Agreement, or otherwise satisfying any indemnification obligation, pending the outcome of any Action to collect or recover Insurance Proceeds, and an Indemnitee need not attempt to collect any Insurance Proceeds prior to making a claim for indemnification or receiving any Indemnity Payment otherwise owed to it under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. -63-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n10.6 Additional Matters. (a) Indemnification payments in respect of any Liabilities for which an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Section 10 shall be paid reasonably promptly (but in any event within sixty (60) days of the final determination of the amount that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Section 10) by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnitee as such Liabilities are incurred upon demand by the Indemnitee, including reasonably satisfactory documentation setting forth the basis for the amount of such indemnification payment, documentation with respect to calculations made and consideration of any Insurance Proceeds that actually reduce the amount of such Liabilities. (b) If (i) a Party incurs any Liability arising out of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; (ii) an adequate legal or equitable remedy is not available for any reason against the other Party to satisfy the Liability incurred by the incurring Party; and (iii) a legal or equitable remedy may be available to the other Party against a Third Party for such Liability, then the other Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the incurring Party, at the incurring Party's expense, to permit the incurring Party to obtain the benefits of such legal or equitable remedy against the Third Party. (c) If payment is made by or on behalf of any Indemnifying Party to any Indemnitee in connection with any Third-Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnitee as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such Indemnitee may have any right, defense or claim relating to such Third-Party Claim against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such Third-Party Claim or against any other Person. Such Indemnitee shall cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost and expense of such Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any subrogated right, defense or claim. (d) In the event of an Action in which the Indemnifying Party is not a named defendant, if either the Indemnitee or Indemnifying Party shall so request, the Parties shall endeavor to substitute the Indemnifying Party for the named defendant or otherwise add the Indemnifying Party as party thereto, if at all practicable. If such substitution or addition cannot be achieved for any reason or is not requested, the named defendant shall allow the Indemnifying Party to manage the Action as set forth in this Section 10, and the Indemnifying Party shall fully indemnify the named defendant against all costs of defending the Action (including court costs, sanctions imposed by a court, attorneys' fees, experts fees and all other external expenses), the costs of any judgment or settlement, and the cost of any interest or penalties relating to any judgment or settlement with respect to such Third-Party Claim. -64-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n11.

Manufacturer agrees to notify Customer of any event that has resulted in or threatens the loss of its C-TPAT Benefits (if it is a member of the C-TPAT program) or alternatively jeopardizes Customer's retention of its own C-TPAT Benefits. In an effort to secure each part of the supply chain, Manufacturer agrees to work in good faith to become a member of the C-TPAT program, if Manufacturer is organized or incorporated in the United States, Mexico or Canada, or the equivalent supply chain security program criteria administered by the customs administration in Manufacturer's home country if Manufacturer is not organized or incorporated in the United States, Mexico or Canada. -69-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n15. Records and Audits. 15.1 Records.\n\nManufacturer will maintain complete and accurate Records. Any Records that are financial in nature such as, but not limited to, time sheets, billing Records, invoices, payment applications, payments of consultants and subcontractors and receipts relating to reimbursable expenses shall be maintained in accordance with applicable Law in the jurisdiction in which the applicable Facility is located. Manufacturer shall maintain such Records for a period equal to the later of (x) three (3) years after the expiration or termination of this Agreement or the applicable Facility Addendum, (y) the expiration of the statute of limitation for the Tax period applicable to such Records, or (z) for such period as otherwise may be required by applicable Law (the \"Record Retention Period\"). 15.2 Audits.\n\nCustomer or its representatives, including its external auditors, may audit such Records of Manufacturer, including all Records related to Manufacturer's compliance with applicable Laws, at any time during the Term of this Agreement or applicable Facility Addendum or the Record Retention Period, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance written notice to Manufacturer (but in no event more than one (1) time per year except \"for cause\"). Manufacturer shall make such Records readily available for such audit. Any Records or information accessed or otherwise obtained by Customer or its representatives in connection with any audit (including any audit pursuant to Section 3.4) shall be deemed Manufacturer's confidential and proprietary Information and each representative of Customer will be subject to non-use and other confidentiality obligations substantially comparable to those set forth herein for Customer. Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.4, if any financial audit reveals that Manufacturer has overcharged Customer, Manufacturer shall reimburse Customer for such overcharge within thirty (30) days of Manufacturer's receipt of the relevant audit results, and in the event that any such overcharge equals an amount equal to or greater than five percent (5%) of the total amounts invoiced during the period under such audit, then Manufacturer shall promptly reimburse Customer for all reasonable Third Party costs and expenses actually incurred in the conduct of such audit. If any financial audit reveals that Customer has underpaid Manufacturer, Customer shall reimburse Manufacturer for such underpayment within thirty (30) days of Customer's receipt of the relevant audit results. For clarity, if there is a conflict between Section 3.4(a) and this Section 15.2 with respect to the review of a Price increase, Section 3.4(a) shall govern and control. -70-\n\nSource: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n16.

Manufacturer has no authority to act or make any agreements or representations on behalf of Customer or its Affiliates. This Agreement is not intended to create, and shall not be construed as creating, between Manufacturer and Customer, the relationship of fiduciary, principal and agent, employer and employee, joint venturers, co-partners, or any other such relationship, the existence of which is expressly denied. No employee or agent engaged by Manufacturer shall be, or shall be deemed to be, an employee or agent of Customer and shall not be entitled to any benefits that Customer provides to its own employees. 17.5 Assignment; Binding Effect. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 17.5, neither Party shall assign this Agreement or any rights, benefits or obligations under or relating to this Agreement, in each case whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the other Party's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Party may assign this Agreement in whole or in part to a Restricted Party. (f) In the event of a permitted assignment, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors and permitted assigns. Any attempted assignment that contravenes the terms of this Agreement shall be void ab initio and of no force or effect.

No failure or delay by a Party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or partial exercise thereof prejudice any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.\n\nAll remedies specified in this Agreement shall be cumulative and in addition to any other remedies provided at Law or in equity. 17.9 Further Documents.\n\nEach Party hereto agrees to execute such further documents and take such further steps as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to effectuate the purposes of this Agreement. 17.10 Forms.\n\nThe Parties recognize that, during the Term of this Agreement, a Purchase Order acknowledgment form or similar routine document (collectively, \"Forms\") may be used to implement or administer provisions of this Agreement.

The term \"Specified Minimum Percentage\" shall be equal to the percentage set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto, which shall be agreed to by AIG and the Company at least once every year beginning upon the date of the filing of the Company's 2014 Annual Statement with the Domiciliary State's insurance department and following review against the capital adequacy standards and criteria (\"Agency Criteria\") of each of Standard & Poor's Corp. (\"S&P\"), Moody's Investors Service (\"Moody's\") and A.M. Best Company (\"A.M. Best\"). Notwithstanding the obligation of the Company and AIG to review the Specified Minimum Percentage on an annual basis, the parties hereto agree to review and revise the Specified Minimum Percentage on a more frequent basis, if the parties agree it is appropriate, to take into account (a) any material changes after the date hereof to any Agency Criteria adopted by any of S&P, Moody's or A.M. Best, on the one hand, or to the law of the Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand, which causes the results under the Agency Criteria to diverge from that under the law of the Domiciliary State or NAIC RBC rules or instructions, (b) the Company completes a material transaction that is treated materially differently by the Agency Criteria, on the one hand, and the NAIC RBC rules or instructions, on the other hand, or (c) any other material development or circumstance affecting the Company which AIG and the Company agree merits a reevaluation of the Specified Minimum Percentage then in effect.\n\n  3.   Timing of Capital Contributions. The Company and AIG agree that any contribution to be made under paragraph 1 will take place within the following two time periods per year, as applicable: (a) during the time beginning on the first business day after the filing of the Company's first\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      fiscal quarterly statutory financial statements and ending on the last business day prior to the end of the Company's second fiscal quarter; and (b) during the time beginning on the first business day after the filing of the Company's third fiscal quarterly statutory financial statements and ending on the last business day prior to the end of the Company's fourth fiscal quarter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in compliance with applicable law, any capital contribution provided for under paragraph 1 may be made by AIG after the close of any fiscal quarter or fiscal year of the Company but prior to the filing by the Company of its statutory financial statements for such fiscal quarter or fiscal year, respectively, and contributions of this nature shall be recognized as capital contributions receivable as of the balance sheet date of the yet to be filed quarterly or annual financial statement (as the case may be), pursuant to paragraph 8 of Statement of Statutory Accounting Principles No. 72, to the extent approved by the Domiciliary State.\n\n  4.   Funding Mechanics. At the time that any contribution is due under paragraph 3, AIG agrees that it will either (a) make such contribution to the Company's direct parent and cause such direct parent to then contribute such funds, securities or instruments so contributed by AIG to the Company, or (b) make such contribution directly to the Company without receiving any capital stock or other ownership interest in exchange therefor. All contributions contemplated under this Agreement shall be approved and made in compliance with applicable law, including, without limitation, approval by the board of directors of each applicable entity and any prior notice or approval requirements specified under applicable rules and regulations.\n\n  5.   AIG Policies. Subject to the requirements of applicable law and the approval, to the extent required, by any or all of the Company's senior management, relevant management committees, board of directors, and of any insurance regulator, the Company hereby acknowledges that, in a manner consistent with past practice and any other reasonable requirements of AIG, it will comply with all financial and budgetary planning, risk mitigation, derisking or pricing, corporate governance, investment, informational and procedural requirements set forth by AIG.\n\n  6.   No Failure to Claim. AIG hereby waives any failure or delay on the part of the Company in asserting or enforcing any of its rights or in making any claims or demands hereunder.\n\n  7.   Termination. Unless earlier terminated in accordance with this paragraph 7, this Agreement shall continue indefinitely. AIG shall have the absolute right to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Company, which notice shall state the effective date of termination (the \"Termination Date\"); provided, however, that AIG agrees not to terminate this Agreement unless (a) AIG significantly modifies the\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      corporate structure or ownership of the Company, or (b) AIG sells the Company to an acquirer, in each case, (i) having a rating from at least one of S&P, Moody's, A.M. Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, that is at least equal to the lower of (x) AIG's then-current rating from such agency or (y) the Company's then-current rating as supported by this Agreement from such agency; or (ii) such that, immediately on the effective date of the modification of corporate structure or sale by AIG of the Company, the Company's capitalization is consistent with the minimum capital adequacy standards and criteria of at least one of S&P, Moody's, A.M. Best or a substitute agency, which is a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, for a rating that is equal to or better than the Company's then-current rating on the date immediately preceding such modification of corporate structure or sale. To the extent not terminated previously by AIG pursuant to the foregoing, this Agreement will terminate automatically one year after the closing of any sale of the Company by AIG, and all provisions hereof will be of no further force and effect. For the avoidance of doubt, the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph 7 shall not relieve either party of any obligation it may owe to the other party hereunder that existed prior to, and remains outstanding as of, the Termination Date.\n\n  8.   Policyholder Rights. Any policyholder holding a policy issued by the Company prior to the termination of this Agreement shall have the right to demand that the Company enforce the Company's rights under paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of this Agreement, and, if the Company fails or refuses to take timely action to enforce such rights or the Company defaults in any claim or other payment owed to any such policyholder when due, such policyholder may proceed directly against AIG to enforce the Company's rights under paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of this Agreement; provided, however, that no policyholder of the Company may take any action authorized under this paragraph 8 unless and until (a) such policyholder has given AIG written notice of its intent to enforce the terms of this Agreement as provided in this paragraph 8, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of and basis for the policyholder's complaint and (b) AIG has failed to comply with this Agreement within sixty (60) days after such notice is given; and, provided, further, that upon termination of this Agreement in accordance with paragraph 7 hereof, the rights of any policyholder as provided for under this paragraph 8 shall terminate effective as of the Termination Date, except with respect to the obligation of AIG (if any) to make capital contributions to the Company pursuant to paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of this Agreement solely to the extent such obligation arose prior to, and remained unsatisfied as of, the Termination Date (it being understood that upon AIG's satisfaction of all such obligations after the Termination Date, no such policyholder shall have any rights against the Company or AIG, as the case may be, under this paragraph 8).\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  9.   No Indebtedness; No Policyholder Recourse Against AIG. This Agreement is not, and nothing herein contained and nothing done pursuant hereto by AIG shall constitute or be construed or deemed to constitute, an evidence of indebtedness or an obligation or liability of AIG as guarantor, endorser, surety or otherwise in respect of any obligation, indebtedness or liability, of any kind whatsoever, of the Company. This Agreement does not provide, and is not intended to be construed or deemed to provide, any policyholder of the Company with recourse to or against any of the assets of AIG.\n\n  10.   Notices. Any notice, instruction, request, consent, demand or other communication required or contemplated by this Agreement shall be in writing, shall be given or made or communicated by United States first class mail, addressed as follows:\n\nIf to AIG:\n\nAmerican International Group, Inc. 175 Water Street New York, New York 10038 Attention: Secretary\n\nIf to the Company:\n\nAmerican General Life Insurance Company\n\n2919 Allen Parkway Houston, Texas 77019 Attention: Chief Financial Officer\n\nwith a copy (which shall not constitute notice) to:\n\nAmerican General Life Insurance Company c/o AIG Life and Retirement 1999 Avenue of the Stars, 27t h Floor Los Angeles, CA 90067 Attention: General Counsel\n\n  11.

Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussion, whether oral or written, of the parties.

Each of the foregoing parties is referred to herein as a \"Party\" and together as the \"Parties\". RECITALS A. Recipient wishes to engage the Provider to provide certain services and resources (the \"Services\") and Provider desires to provide Recipient with the Services all in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein. AGREEMENT The Parties hereby agree as follows: 1. Services. 1.1 Provision of Services. (a) Provider agrees to provide the Services set forth on the Exhibit A attached hereto (as such Exhibit may be amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the \"Exhibit\") to Recipient for the respective periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Exhibit. Notwithstanding the contents of the Exhibit, Provider agrees to respond in good faith to any reasonable request by Recipient for access to any additional services and resources that are necessary for the operation of the Recipient and which are not currently contemplated in the Exhibit, at a price to be agreed upon after good faith negotiations between the Parties. Any such additional services and resources so provided by Provider shall constitute Services under this Agreement and be subject in all respect to the provisions of this Agreement as if fully set forth on the Exhibit as of the date hereof. (b) Recipient may freely assign its rights under this Agreement to receive the Services to any of its affiliates. 1.2 Standard of Service.

Provider Representatives shall be dedicated to solely providing the Services to Recipient and shall not provide any such services or resources to Provider or any other customer of Provider. (d) Recipient acknowledges that this Agreement does not create a fiduciary relationship, partnership, joint venture or relationships of trust or agency between the Parties and that all Services are provided by Provider as an independent contractor. (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.2: (a) in the event that Provider uses any subcontractors to perform any Services, Provider is not released from responsibility for its obligations under this Agreement; (b) Provider shall remain fully responsible, financially and otherwise, for the Services provided by each subcontractor to the same extent as if Provider had performed the Services itself (subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement) and agrees to pay the fees and expenses of any such subcontractor; (c) Provider shall remain ultimately responsible for ensuring that the Services are provided and any such subcontractor performs any such obligations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and (d) the obligations with respect to the nature, quality and standards of care set forth in Section 1.2 are satisfied with respect to any Service provided by any subcontractor. (f) Provider shall at all times during the term of this Agreement maintain, or cause to be maintained, the computer software and computer hardware that is used in connection with the Services with substantially the same degree of care, skill and diligence with which Provider maintains, or causes to be maintained, as of the Effective Date, such computer software and computer hardware for itself, consistent with past practices, as of the Effective Date, including without limitation, with respect to type, quality and timeliness of such maintenance. 1.3 Additional Services. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the Recipient from itself performing or from acquiring services from other providers that are similar to or identical to the Services. 1.4 Intellectual Property.

If the Force Majeure in question prevails for a continuous period in excess of three months after the date on which the Force Majeure begins, Provider shall be entitled to give notice to Recipient to terminate the Affected Services.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, \"Confidential Information\" shall not include any information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate: (a) was publicly known at the time of disclosure to it, or has become publicly known through no act of the Receiving Party or its representatives in breach of this Section 4.1, (b) was rightfully received from a third party without a duty of confidentiality, or (c) was developed by it independently without any reliance on the Confidential Information. 4.2 Return of Confidential Information. Upon demand by the Disclosing Party at any time, or upon expiration or termination of this Agreement with respect to any Service, the Receiving Party agrees promptly to return or destroy, at the Disclosing Party's option, all Confidential Information received in connection with this Agreement. If such Confidential Information is destroyed, an authorized officer of the Receiving Party shall certify to such destruction in writing. 5. Indemnification. 5.1 Indemnification.

Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, and notwithstanding any exclusions described below, \"Confidential Information\" of EMV includes the EMV Proprietary Rights, including any portion thereof, modifications and derivatives thereof, and information or materials derived therefrom.      * Confidential treatment has been requested for certain portions of this Exhibit.

The Receiving Party shall not disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to any third parties except as otherwise permitted hereunder. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party only to those employees, contractors or consultants who have a need to know such Confidential Information and who are bound to retain the confidentiality thereof under provisions (including, without limitation, provisions relating to non-use and nondisclosure) no less strict than those required by the Receiving Party for its own comparable Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall maintain Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party with at least the same degree of care it uses to protect its own proprietary information of a similar nature or sensitivity, but no less than reasonable care under the circumstances. Any copies of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information shall be identified as belonging to the Disclosing Party and prominently marked \"Confidential.\"   9.3 Exemptions   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party's confidentiality obligations will not apply to Confidential Information which (i) is already in the Receiving Party's possession at the time of disclosure to the Receiving Party, (ii) is or becomes part of public knowledge other than as a result of any action or inaction of the Receiving Party, (iii) is obtained by the Receiving Party from an unrelated third party without a duty of confidentiality, or (iv) is independently developed by the Receiving Party.   9.4 Judicial Action   This Agreement will not prevent the Receiving Party from disclosing Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent required by a judicial order or other legal obligation, provided that, in such event, the Receiving Party shall promptly notify the Disclosing Party to allow intervention (and shall cooperate with the Disclosing Party) to contest or minimize the scope of the disclosure (including application for a protective order). Each party shall advise the other party in writing of any misappropriation or misuse of Confidential Information of the other party of which the notifying party becomes aware.   9.5 Remedies   Each party (as Receiving Party) acknowledges that the Disclosing Party considers its Confidential Information to contain trade secrets of the Disclosing Party and that any unauthorized use or disclosure of such information would cause the Disclosing Party irreparable harm for which its remedies at law would be inadequate. Accordingly, each party (as Receiving Party) acknowledges and agrees that the Disclosing Party shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedies available to it at law or in equity, to the issuance of injunctive relief, without bond, enjoining any breach or threatened breach of the Receiving Party's obligations hereunder with respect to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, and such further relief as any court of competent jurisdiction may deem just and proper.     * Confidential treatment has been requested for certain portions of this Exhibit.
