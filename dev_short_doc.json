Before you start the installation; check the Jazz for Service Management Technotes [http://www.ibm.com/support/search.wss?q=jazzsm1130relnotes] for late breaking issues or updated installation instructions.\n 2.  Determine the set of platform-specific images to download for the installation scenario or integration services to install; as summarized in the following table. Scenario Images Full installation; all integration services and middleware  * Jazz\u2122 for Service Management 1.1.3.0\n      * IBM\u00ae Tivoli\u00ae Common Reporting 3.1.3.0\n      * IBM\u00ae WebSphere\u00ae Application Server 8.5.5.9\n      * IBM\u00ae DB2\u00ae Enterprise Server Edition 10.5\n     \n     Custom installation; Dashboard Application Services Hub  * Jazz\u2122 for Service Management 1.1.3.0\n      * IBM\u00ae WebSphere\u00ae Application Server 8.5.5.9; optional if already installed\n      * IBM\u00ae WebSphere\u00ae Application Server V8.5 Supplements; for high availability environment only\n      * IBM\u00ae DB2\u00ae Enterprise Server Edition 10.5; for high availability environment only\n     \n     Custom installation; Reporting Services  * Jazz\u2122 for Service Management 1.1.3.0\n      * IBM\u00ae Tivoli\u00ae Common Reporting 3.1.3.0\n      * IBM\u00ae WebSphere\u00ae Application Server 8.5.5.9; optional if already installed\n      * IBM\u00ae DB2\u00ae Enterprise Server Edition 10.5; optional if already installed\n     \n     \n 3.

Select the Find by part number search option under Download finder options.\n 6.  Search for each downloadable image by part number; as outlined in the relevant Operating_System tab in this download document.\n 7.  Select and download only the images for your platform that you need.\n 8.  Extract the downloaded images into directories that you created in step 3. \n     \n     Important: If you have downloaded the middleware and you want to perform a full installation; ensure that your Install_Imgs_Home directory is set up as follows:\n     |-ESE (Windows) [extracted DB2 installation image on Windows] \n     |-ese (UNIX) [extracted DB2 installation image on AIX; Linux; or Linux for System z] \n     |-WASRepository [extracted WebSphere Application Server installation image]\n     |-TCRCognos [extracted Tivoli Common Reporting Cognos\u00ae installation image] This directory structure is not required for a custom installation; for example; installing a subset of integration services by using the launchpad custom workflow or IBM Installation Manager GUI.\n     \n     \n 9.  To perform a full installation; download the Quick Start image with a part number of CNC1MML. It contains quick start guides for these installation scenarios.  * CNC1MML_JazzSM_lang_code.pdf - Quick start guide for the full installation scenario; to install all Jazz for Service Management integration services; IBM DB2\u00ae; and IBM WebSphere\u00ae Application Server on a single server for evaluation and development purposes. \n     \n     \n 10. If you want to perform a custom installation; for example; install only a subset of Jazz for Service Management integration services or use existing supported installations of WebSphere Application Server or DB2; see Custom installation scenario [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEKCU_1.1.3.0/com.ibm.psc.doc/install/psc_c_install_advanced_opt.html] in the Jazz for Service Management documentation.\n\n\n\nTAB NAVIGATION\n * AIX\u00ae\n * Linux\n * Linux on System z\u00ae\n * Windows\n\n\n\nSee Jazz for Service Management Detailed System Requirements [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038732] for the AIX operating systems on which Jazz for Service Management is supported.\n\nDownloadable images with part numbers\n\nYou can download electronic images for Jazz for Service Management and its database and application server middleware.

Under load, if an LDAP connection is not available in VMM's pool (context or connection), VMM will attempt to open a new connection.

If the operating system's limit on open files is already met, this request will result in \"java.net.SocketException: Too many open files\".\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nInspect wimconfig.xml to determine if VMM's LDAP connections are unbounded. Check both the connection pool (used for authentication in a federated repository configuration): \n\n\n<config:ldapServers... connectionPool=\"true\" - indicates an unbounded connection pool\n\nand the context pool (used for all other requests, e.g. group membership and attribute values):\n\n<config:contextPool enabled=\"true\" ... maxPoolSize=\"0\" - indicates an unbounded context pool \n\n \n\nLimit VMM's connections to the LDAP per Technote 1392092, linked below. \n\nAlso, verify that the operating system is correctly prepared according to the InfoCenter.

This may be a userid coded on the jobcard, the userid of the submitting TWSz started task, or the userid of a TSO ISPF dialog user who submits these jobs either via the TWSz dialogs, or directly from TSO. \n\nDebugging/Troubleshooting:\n\nTo resolve the EQQPT52E error message, the first thing to confirm is that the server task,\nand the id that the EQQDNTOP runs under belong are connected to the RACF group.\n\nThis can be done with an LU command, for example (in this example, the RACF group is named OPC, and the server task is OP8S)\n\nIssue the following RACF command:\n\nlu op8s omvs \n\n(system response)\nUSER=OP8S NAME=UNKNOWN OWNER=IBMUSER CREATED=01.283 \nDEFAULT-GROUP=OPC PASSDATE=00.000 PASS-INTERVAL= 30 \nATTRIBUTES=NONE \nREVOKE DATE=NONE RESUME DATE=NONE \nLAST-ACCESS=03.117/19:20:43 \nCLASS AUTHORIZATIONS=NONE \nNO-INSTALLATION-DATA \nNO-MODEL-NAME \nLOGON ALLOWED (DAYS) (TIME) \n--------------------------------------------- \nANYDAY ANYTIME \nGROUP=OPC AUTH=USE CONNECT-OWNER=IBMUSER CONNECT-DATE=01.28\nCONNECTS= 574 UACC=NONE LAST-CONNECT=03.117/19:20:43 \nCONNECT ATTRIBUTES=NONE \nREVOKE DATE=NONE RESUME DATE=NONE \nSECURITY-LEVEL=NONE SPECIFIED \nCATEGORY-AUTHORIZATION \nNONE SPECIFIED \nSECURITY-LABEL=NONE SPECIFIED \n\nOMVS INFORMATION \n---------------- \nUID= 0000000142 \nHOME= /u/op8s \nPROGRAM= /bin/sh \nCPUTIMEMAX= NONE \n\nThis shows that the OP8S id is connected to the OPC group, and its UID is\n0000000142.\n\nIf the OP8S id in this example did NOT have an OMVS segment defined, the following\ncommand would create it:\n\nALTUSER (OP8S) - \nOMVS(UID(142) HOME('/u/op8s') PROGRAM('/bin/sh')) \n\nIf the OP8S id were not connected to the OPC group, the following command\nwould correct this:\n\nconnect (OP8S) group(opc) uacc(update) \n\n\nNext, verify the OMVS GID of the RACF group (OPC in this case) with an LG (listgroup)\ncommand:\n\nlg opc omvs \n\n(system response)\nINFORMATION FOR GROUP OPC \nSUPERIOR GROUP=OMVS OWNER=IBMUSER \nNO INSTALLATION DATA \nNO MODEL DATA SET \nTERMUACC \nNO SUBGROUPS \nUSER(S)= ACCESS= ACCESS COUNT= UNIVERSAL ACCESS= \n\nOP8C USE 007039 NONE \nCONNECT ATTRIBUTES=NONE \nREVOKE DATE=NONE RESUME DATE=NONE \nOP8T USE 000403 NONE \nCONNECT ATTRIBUTES=NONE \nREVOKE DATE=NONE RESUME DATE=NONE \nOP8S USE 000574 NONE \nCONNECT ATTRIBUTES=NONE \nREVOKE DATE=NONE RESUME DATE=NONE \nOP8D USE 000250 NONE \nCONNECT ATTRIBUTES=NONE \nREVOKE DATE=NONE RESUME DATE=NONE \nATKNSN3 USE 000005 NONE \n\n\nOMVS INFORMATION \n---------------- \nGID= 0001000009 \n*** \n\n\n\nThis shows that the GID value 0001000009\n\nIf there was no GID value, the following procedure could\nbe used to create one:\n\nFrom the OMVS shell (TSO option: ISPF Shell OpenMVS ISPF Shell )\n\nCursor select \"SETUP\" then enter option 7 (enable superuser mode)\n\nCursor select \"SETUP\" again, then enter option 4 (all groups)\n\n\nA popup windows is displayed: \n\nSet Up All Groups \n\nTo assign a unique GID to all groups \nthat currently do not have a GID \nalready assigned, press Enter. \n\nPress enter, and GIDs will be assigned to all groups that don't already have one;\nthen use the LG command to see what the GID is.\n.\n\nAt this point, with UID and GID verified, the EQQPCS05 job must be run with\nthe appropriate values. For example:\n\nEQQPCS05:\n\n//ALLOHFS EXEC PGM=BPXBATCH,REGION=4M \n//STDOUT DD PATH='/tmp/eqqpcs05out', \n// PATHOPTS=(OCREAT,OTRUNC,OWRONLY),PATHMODE=SIRWXU \n//STDIN DD PATH='/usr/lpp/TWS/TWS810/bin/config', \n// PATHOPTS=(ORDONLY) \n//STDENV DD * \neqqBINDIR=/usr/lpp/TWS/TWS810 \neqqWRKDIR=/var/TWS/inst \neqqGID=0001000009 \neqqUID=142 \n\nAt this point, assuming the BATCHOPT member pointed to in the EQQDNTOP \njob has a valid TPLGYPRM parameter that points to a parmlib member with\nthe TOPOLOGY information, and the SERVOPTS parms belonging to the server\ntask also point to the same member in the TPLGYPRM parameter, the CP\nEXTEND job should handle the symphony file change correctly. \n\n\nIf still getting EQQPT52E at this point, here are some additional things to try:\n\n(1) Change the EQQMLOG in the server task to DD SYSOUT=* instead of \nhaving a disk dataset specified. The disk file may be causing \na problem due to a code problem. \n\n(2) The PTFs for PQ69392 (UQ73587) and PQ65556 (UQ70707,UQ70720, \nUQ70721) should be applied. \n\n(3) To get more detailed information for troubleshooting, add the following \nDIAGNOSE statements in EQQPARM: \n\n(1) CONTROLLER: DIAGNOSE NMMFLAGS('00003000') \n(2) BATCH (CP EXTEND): DIAGNOSE PLANMGRFLAGS('00040000') \n(3) SERVER : DIAGNOSE TPLGYFLAGS(X'181F0000') \n\n(4) Take a tar backup of the WRKDIR ( tar -cvzf tarfile /WRKDIR): \n\n(5) Do the following: \n\nA. refresh the CP (dialog option 9.5) \nB. stop controller and server \nC. Delete the WRKDIR ( rm -r /WRKDIR)\nD. Run EQQPCS05 job to create a new WRKDIR \nE. reallocate the following sequential datasets: CKPT, JTARC, \nJTx (where x=1...5), EV, TWSIN and TWSOU (RENAME the old files. \nDo not delete them in case they may be needed in step #6, below). \n\n(See also DOC APAR PM02690) \n\n(6) If the EQQPT52E problem persists, save the following documentation for\nlevel 2 support:\n\n(A) controller and server EQQMLOGs\n(B) output of the CP EXTEND (EQQDNTOP) job\n(C) TWSIN and TWSOU files\n(D) stdlist for TRANSLATOR\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n TWSZ TWSzOS TWSZ/OS OPC E2E", "document_id": "swg21144408"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I purchased the SPSS grad pack and put one of the licenses on one computer and another on this one.

For key export to work, various conditions must be met: \n\n * HSMs must be initialized and in the same key sharing domain on exporting and importing machines \n * The private key in question must be marked exportable at keygen time (see keygen's exportable option) \n * HSMs on exporting and importing machines must share internal key-wrapping keys (see hsm-clone-kwk command). A key-wrapping key is a key that encrypts another key.\n\n\nEach HSM has a special key inside of it, the key-wrapping key, that is used to encrypt exported private keys (and to decrypt imported private keys). If the goal is to restore exported keys to the same appliance, then you don't need to worry about hsm-clone-kwk, red keys, or the hsm-domain parameter. That is because the key-wrapping key at import time will already match the key-wrapping key at export time (since the HSM device is the same). If the goal is to move exported keys from one appliance to another one, then all of the steps in this section must be followed :- \n\nFirst, the two HSMs in question must be both be initialized and in the same key sharing domain. This means that they must both be initialized in the same mode (both in Security Level 2 or both in Security Level 3). In Security Level 2 mode, they must have used the same hsm-domain parameter during hsm-reinit (this parameter has a default value that is the same on all appliances). In Security Level 3 mode, they must have used the same red PED key during hsm-reinit (and the second initialization must not have overwritten the key value from the first initialization). \n\nSecond, the key to be exported must be exportable. The exportability of keys is immutable. It is determined at keygen time, and it is controlled by that command's exportable parameter. If a key was created outside of the appliance (not using keygen), then it is always considered exportable. \n\nFinally, before the crypto-export crypto-import sequence, the key-wrapping keys must be synchronized using the hsm-clone-kwk command. This command must be run four times: once on the source HSM appliance (with the key-wrapping key you are copying), once on the destination HSM appliance, once again on the source HSM appliance, and once again on the destination HSM appliance. Each time the command is run, it will need the output file from the previous step (as the input to the current step) which must be moved manually (usually with the copy command). \n\nOnce all of this has been done, then private keys may move from system to system with crypto-export and crypto-import. \n\nNote that the non-HSM appliance can export keys immediately at keygen time, but never at a later time. \n\nFor additional information refer to the online Info Center [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wsdatap/v3r8m2/index.jsp?topic=%2Fxi50%2Fwelcome.htm] and search for \"PIN entry device\".\n\nNote: You will need to sign into the documentation portal with your IBM Registration ID and password.", "document_id": "swg21412061"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "During our latest deployment of a larger process application we received the following error\n\nThe transaction log for database 'BPMDB' is full.

However, it's best to check the ps output or the javacore for the argument -Xcompressedrefs \n\nIf you find the argument -Xnocompressedrefs has been added, this means it's disabled (see page 7 of this document [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf] for more info)) \n\n \n\nWhat happens to jextract if I cannot determine if compressed references was enabled? \n\nIf you run jextract and did not realize compressed references was enabled, the output will ask you to rerun jextract and add the following argument: -J-Xcompressedrefs \n\n\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n MustGather: Crash on AIX [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21055387]\nMustGather: Crash on Linux [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21104706]\nMustGather: Crash on Windows [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21053924]\nGenerating Userdumps on Windows [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21138203]\nCrash on AIX produces no core or a truncated core [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21052642]\nCrash on Linux produces no core or a truncated core [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21115658]", "document_id": "swg21577379"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I receive the following during UDX compilation Can't exec \"/nz/kit/bin/adm/nzudxcompile\": Argument list too long", "id": "DEV_Q012", "answers": [{"answer_id": 37228720, "document_id": "swg21959723", "question_id": "DEV_Q012", "text": "This ARG_MAX kernel parameter adjusted to much larger from kernel release version 2.6.23, that is 2621440 (http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/argmax [http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/argmax]). \n\nBut we support upto Redhat 5.11 in Twinfin which is less than kernel release 2.6.23.

In that case, refer to technote Migrating to the latest version of Operational Decision Management [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21589725]. \n\nThat being said, make sure to consider migrating to the latest version or release ( V.R.M.F) of the product as soon as possible to benefit from the latest added features and improvements. \nANSWER\nAs with any software product, even if you do not have any issues with running your current configuration, you should apply the latest modification or fix pack to take advantage of these benefits: \n\n * Anticipate and avoid the risk of encountering defects already fixed. \n * Apply the latest product improvements that are available (performance, for example). \n * Maintain a serviceable system and be able to install an interim fix when required.\n\n\n\nWHEN TO UPDATE\nThe latest modification or fix pack should be installed as soon as it is available. \n\nYou can subscribe to the IBM Support My Notifications [https://www.ibm.com/support/mynotifications] to be notified of any fix pack releases, and you can also bookmark the Operational Decision Manager Download document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24031636] page, which lists the latest modifications or fix packs. \n\nSee the technote Fix pack release notification for Operational Decision Manager [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21665593] to find out when a modification or fix pack will be available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBEFORE UPDATING\n\n\nThe databases used in the sample server are deleted and recreated during the update. If you are using those databases and want to save the existing content, perform the following steps before updating: \n *  Stop the sample server. In the folder <ODM_HOME>/shared/data/derby, create an archive file containing the resdb and rtsdb folders. Save the archive file, such as zip file, in the data folder. After installation, unzip the archive file in the folder <ODM_HOME>/shared/data/derby to restore your databases before restarting the sample server. \n\n\n\nA new profile is also created for the sample server, at the first server start following the installation of a modification or fix pack. \n\nIf you want to continue using the same ports, you must delete the existing profile prior. In the <ODM_HOME>/shared/bin folder, from the command line, run the command ../tools/ant/bin/ant forcedestroyprofile. \n\n\nNote: The sample server is not designed to be used in a production system. For a production system, you must create a dedicated profile and database that you update using the following steps. \n\n\n\n\nUPDATING\n\n\nEach modification or fix pack page provides instructions on how to download and run the installer, in addition to providing a list of corrections that are included in the update. \n\nThe fix pack installation updates the following files and folders:  * JAR libraries in the installation directories, including <ODMInstallDir>\\<Module>\\lib. \n * EAR and WAR applications in the <ODMInstallDir>\\<Module>\\applicationservers\\<App Server> folders.\n\n\nOnce this is done, you perform these tasks:  * Repackage your client applications with the up-to-date libraries. \n * Reapply product customizations to the up-to-date Java EE modules (EARs and WARs).\n\n\n\nNote that all customizations you developed before the update, for example modifications of the descriptors, must be reapplied to the new, up-to-date EARs and WARs. It is a good idea to document and automate those customizations using scripts to make the process easier and error-proof. \n\nFinally, you must update the client applications and ODM modules on your server or servers with the same settings as you deployed previously. If you redeploy the application, follow again the documentation instructions to deploy all ODM modules to your servers [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r5m1/topic/com.ibm.odm.distrib.config/topics/odm_distrib_config.html]. \n\nKeep in mind that applying a modification or a fix pack does not require any data migration, so your projects and database remain the same. \n\nUPDATING RULE EXECUTION SERVER\n\n\nUpdate the following applications in the application server:  *  jrules-res-xu-<server>.rar jrules-res-management-<server>.ear jrules-ssp-<server>.ear jrules-res-htds-<server>ear \n\n\nMake sure you do not change the class loading policies for applications and modules ( parent last for all ODM modules). \n\nNote: Updating the eXecution Unit RAR file requires a restart of the server. \n\n\nUPDATE DECISION CENTER\n\n\nUpdate the following application in your application server: \n * jrules-teamserver-<server>.ear\n\n\nMake sure you do not change the class loading policies for applications and modules ( parent last for all ODM modules). \n\nUPDATE THE EVENTS RUNTIME\n\n 1. Stop the event runtime application, wberuntimeear. \n 2. Uninstall the following applications, if they exist:  * wbefileconnector \n     * wbehttpconnector \n     * wbejdbcconnector \n     * wbejmsconnector \n     * wbesoapconnector\n    \n    \n 3. Update the application wberuntimeear. \n 4. Start the application wberuntimeear.\n\n\nMake sure you do not change the class loading policies for applications and modules ( parent last for all ODM modules). \n\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS\n * Again, in addition to applying the latest modification or fix pack, consider migrating to the latest version or release (V.R.M.F) of the product as soon as possible to benefit from recently added features and improvements.

Applying fixpacks of WebSphere Application Server also upgrades the SDK that is packaged and bundled within the fixpack. Additionally, separate Java SDK fixpacks are also available that contain just the SDK updates which can be applied to upgrade the SDK.\n\nWebSphere Application Server V7.0\nAny V7.0 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.6.0 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\n\nWebSphere Application Server V6.1\nAny V6.1 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.5.0 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\n\nWebSphere Application Server V6.0\nAny V6.0 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.4.2 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\n\nWebSphere Application Server V5.1\nAny V5.1 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.4.1 and any V5.1.1 can be upgraded to the latest Java SDK 1.4.2 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\n\nWebSphere Application Server V5.0\nAny V5.0 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.3.1 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\n\n\n\nDetails of Java SDK Upgrade Policy\n\nWebSphere Application Server leverages the Java SDK as a base component. This results in unique support issues, including:\n\n\n * Matching Java SDK service releases to Application Server releases and fix packs\n   \n   \n * Delivering updates and fixes associated with the Java SDK on any given Application Server release.\n\n\nIn an effort to resolve customer Java SDK situations as quickly as possible, WebSphere Application Server Support has done a quickest-path-to-resolution analysis, determining the most direct way to collect problem information. \n\nIn some cases, problem resolution might include finding shortcuts to resolve symptoms. One shortcut is an immediate upgrade to a newer compatible Java SDK service release, before gathering detailed problem determination data. \n\nThere are multiple advantages to performing an immediate Java SDK upgrade as a quicker path to resolution over a full Problem Determination (PD) process: \n 1. There is a continuous stream of fixes going into the Java SDK. Many problems encountered by customers are resolved by these fixes.\n    \n    \n 2. When a new problem is encountered, applying the latest Java SDK is a quick way to determine if related fixes change the symptoms or correct the problem.\n    \n    \n 3. Many documented Java SDK fixes have common symptoms. Frequently, limited PD data does not isolate the problem to a single root cause.\n    \n\n\nThese factors highlight the advantage of applying a newer Java SDK before working through a full PD cycle. \n\nJava SDK and WebSphere Application Server software are updated frequently. To avoid compatibility issues for customers, WebSphere Application Server Support maintains this Java SDK Upgrade Policy. \n\nWebSphere Application Server Support details: \nhttp://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/support.html [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/support.html] \n\nIdentifying compatibility limitations between WebSphere Application Server releases and Java SDK service releases that have not been tested together reduces risk. \n\nImportant: Using a Java SDK not specifically packaged with WebSphere Application Server and supplied by IBM, or in violation of the Java SDK Upgrade Policy, is not supported by IBM WebSphere Application Server Support for Java SDK problems.

These duplicate names can lead to deployment failure on the Process Server. \n\nSYMPTOM\nFor example, you might have three snapshots in Process Center with the following name and acronym that is deployed on Process Server: \n\nMYAPPS v1.1.0 MYAPP_1 \nMYAPPS v1.1.1 MYAPP_2 \nMYAPPS v1.1.2 MYAPP_3 \n\nYou then complete the following steps: \n\n 1. Set up a new Process Center or clean the old Process Center by restoring the database. \n    \n    \n 2. Import the latest snapshot of \"MYAPPS v1.1.2.\"\n    \n    \n 3. Develop more services and create a new snapshot called MYAPPS v1.1.3, which uses the same naming convention.\n    \n    \n 4. Create a package for offline deployment. The generated acronym is MYAPP_1, which leads to a deployment failure on Process Server because of the duplicate acronym. For example: \n    \n    MYAPPS v1.1.3 MYAPP_1 \n    \n    \n\n\nYou see SqlIntegrityConstraintViolationException messages like the following text: \nWASX7015E: Exception running command: \"$AdminTask\nBPMInstallOfflinePackage {-inputFile /tmp/APSAP_1.zip}\"; exception \ninformation: \njava.lang.Exception: java.lang.Exception: \ncom.lombardisoftware.client.delegate.BusinessDelegateException:\nPreparedStatementCallback; SQL [update LSW_SNAPSHOT set CREATED_ON = \n?,NAME = ?,ACRONYM = ?,DESCRIPTION = ?,SEQ_NUM = ?,ERROR_COUNTER = \n?,ORIG_CREATED_ON = ?,ACTIVATED_ON = ?,STATUS = ?,ARCHIVED_ON =\n?,LAST_MODIFIED = ?,REPOSITORY_BRANCH_ID = ?,CREATED_BY_USER_ID =\n?,BRANCH_ID = ?,PROJECT_ID = ?,LAST_MODIFIED_BY_USER_ID = ?,CHANGE_DATA\n= ?,IS_ACTIVE = ?,IS_BLA_ACTIVE = ?,IS_STARTED = ?,IS_INSTALLED =\n?,IS_BLA_INSTALLED = ?,IS_TIP_DEPLOYED = ?,IS_DEFAULT =\n?,TIP_DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS = ?,IS_ARCHIVED = ? where SNAPSHOT_ID = ?]; \nError for batch element #1: DB2 SQL Error: SQLCODE=-803, SQLSTATE=23505, \nSQLERRMC=2;BPMBDBA.LSW_SNAPSHOT, DRIVER=4.11.69; nested exception is \ncom.ibm.db2.jcc.am.SqlIntegrityConstraintViolationException: Error for \nbatch element #1: DB2 SQL Error: SQLCODE=-803, SQLSTATE=23505, \nSQLERRMC=2;BPMBDBA.LSW_SNAPSHOT, DRIVER=4.11.69 \nCAUSE\nAfter you recreate the Process Center, it becomes out of synch with its Process Server and the counter that is associated with acronym starts back at 1. The new snapshot starts with 1, for example MYAPP_1, as expected. Process Center is not aware of the all the acronyms for the snapshots that are installed on Process Server so it cannot automatically adjust the counter that is associated with the acronym.\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nThis scenario applies to both Process Application and Toolkit snapshots. The snapshot acronyms are appended with a number if they are not unique. However, it is best to avoid this situation. \n\n\nThe snapshot acronym is equal to the first 4-7 capital letters, numbers and special characters. You should put the version numbers first so that the acronyms can be unique and match with the snapshot name.\n\nUsing a large number of duplicate acronyms for your snapshots, which include automatically generated numbers appended to them, makes it much harder to keep them unique across multiple Process Center environments. Any automatically generated numbers only take the current environment into account.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nYou can use one of the following two options to resolve this issue: \n\n * Use a new naming convention.\n   For any snapshots that currently have non-unique acronyms, you need to create a new snapshot and ensure it has an acronym that is unique across your environments. Then, you need to update the snapshots to use the correct toolkits.\n   \n   \n * Clean up the Process Server by deleting the snapshots using the BPMDeleteSnapshot command. For more information on this command, see the BPMDeleteSnapshot command [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v8r0m1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.wbpm.ref.doc/topics/rref_deletesnapshot.html] topic in the information center.\n\n\n\nAfter the snapshots are deleted or removed from the Process Server, you can use any naming convention. \n\nYou must be aware of this synchronization problem when you create new Process Centers and use an old Process Server.

It has the same capabilities and updates that RAD users expect. \n\nSupport for this new WAS packaged in RAD:\nNew message during installation has worried users, however, users with an active support contract for their production WebSphere Application Server are entitled for support on the developer machine as long as an active support contract is in place for the production server.\n\n\n * Evaluation software page: https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/ws/wasdevelopers/index.html [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/ws/wasdevelopers/index.html] \n * FAQ: https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/ws/wasdevelopers/faq-wasdevelopers.html [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/ws/wasdevelopers/faq-wasdevelopers.html]\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nTo change/upgrade RAD 9.6 WAS4D to WAS ILAN. \n\nAdd the following repository to Installation Manager: https://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/com.ibm.websphere.ILAN.v90/ [https://www.ibm.com/software/repositorymanager/com.ibm.websphere.ILAN.v90/]", "document_id": "swg22005352"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "\n\nFor a certain ruleset, no trace is logged in DW, and no records can be found in EXEUTION_TRACES table of DW database.\n\nServer logs do not contain any messages about the execution traces for this ruleset.\n\nThe issue reproduces only for this project.

The attached sample uses the java.util.logging API to append to the ilog.rules.support.debugtrace.DebugTraceDAO logger the following: \n\n * at SEVERE level any exception that occurred while attempting to persist the trace to the database \n * at INFO level a summary of the trace with ruleset path information and a list of execution events \n * at FINEST level the list of session response warnings and the full execution trace XML (beware this can be a very large amount of information going to the log, possibly several megabytes)\n\n\nBy default only INFO level and above messages (including SEVERE) are typically visible in the application server logs.

Therefore, if a network alias name were\n   resolved via a pair of DNS records, e.g. of CNAME and A types,\n   and the TTL value of CNAME record were shorter than the one of\n   the\n   A record, Datapower would cache the name-to-address translation\n   entry using the A TTL, effectively disregarding the CNAME TTL\n   value, which is not compliant with RFC-1034.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\n *  The fix sets TTL to the lesser of the A record or the CNAME\n   record.\n   \n   The fix is available in 3.8.2.16, 4.0.1.14, 4.0.2.10 and 5.0.0.4\n   \n   For a list of the latest fix packs available, please see:\n   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21237631 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21237631]\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nTEMPORARY FIX\n *  Customers that have control over their DNS infrastructure can\n   configure the server to use timeout values on their A or AAAA\n   records to be shorter than the ones for CNAME records.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nCOMMENTS\n\nAPAR INFORMATION\n * APAR NUMBER\n   IC86912\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT NAME\n   DATAPOWER\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT ID\n   DP1234567\n   \n   \n * REPORTED RELEASE\n   401\n   \n   \n * STATUS\n   CLOSED PER\n   \n   \n * PE\n   NoPE\n   \n   \n * HIPER\n   NoHIPER\n   \n   \n * SPECIAL ATTENTION\n   NoSpecatt\n   \n   \n * SUBMITTED DATE\n   2012-10-01\n   \n   \n * CLOSED DATE\n   2012-11-13\n   \n   \n * LAST MODIFIED DATE\n   2012-11-23\n   \n   \n\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED FROM ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n * APAR IS SYSROUTED TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n\nFIX INFORMATION\n * FIXED COMPONENT NAME\n   DATAPOWER\n   \n   \n * FIXED COMPONENT ID\n   DP1234567\n   \n   \n\nAPPLICABLE COMPONENT LEVELS\n * R382 PSN\n   UP\n   \n   \n * R401 PSN\n   UP\n   \n   \n * R402 PSN\n   UP\n   \n   \n * R500 PSN\n   UP", "document_id": "swg1IC86912"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "\n\nI am new in datacap 9.0 .I just started developing with datacap studio and currently I have learned  to recognize, capture and export the data into filenet.\n\nNow I want to Create batches of image or pdf files so that I can process images and pdf .\n\n \n\nAs per requirement client is sharing document at one shared location.I need to pickup all the documnets from shared location.

An attempt by a JRules module to try and access its data base through one such data source connection provided by the Application Server may then fail. \nThe network connection of a data source may become invalid for a number of reasons, one typical example is that a firewall between the Application Server and the Database has a policy to discard network connections that remain idle for some time.\n\n\nENVIRONMENT\nThe exception com.ibm.websphere.ce.cm.StaleConnectionException is specific to WebSphere Application Server environments. But a similar issue can be experienced with Weblogic, see: Rule Execution Server on WebLogic unable to load ruleset after period of inactivity [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21615801]\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nConfigure the WebSphere Application Server data source connection pool [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/udat_conpoolset.html] so as to eliminate occurrences of StaleConnectionException : \n\n * Set the Minimum connections to 0 to avoid situations where a connection is kept in the pool to meet the minimum requirement, even though it may have been idle for longer than Unused timeout \n * Set the values for Unused timeout and Reap timeout so that the sum does not exceed any network level idle connection timeout\n\n\nThe document Troubleshooting stale connection problems [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21247168#SCETroubleshooting] provides further information.

RuleApps deployed from one console will not be visible to the other console(s), and you will get unpredictable results if updates are published through a Rule Execution Server console that is out of sync. In order to re-synchronize the consoles, you will need to manually click \"Update RuleApps\" icon of each console, which forces a read from the persistence layer. \n\nIn an active/passive configuration, execution statistics could be incorrect on the passive Rule Execution Server console(s). When the active Rule Execution Server console is down, system administrator will need to log on to the passive Rule Execution Server console and update the RuleApps. Then Rule Team Server (RTS) users or Rule Studio users can deploy rulesets by pointing to the back up Rule Execution Server console instance. \n\nNote that we do not support load balancing mode with active/active configuration.\n\nYou can refer to this technote [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21449103]for limitations when deploying more than one Rule Execution Server console.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n#Clustering Rule Team Server [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21400812]\nClustering Decision Validation Services [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21425487]\nClustering a transparent decision service [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21473114]\n\n\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration IBM Operational Decision Manager Platform Independent 7.5 Enterprise", "document_id": "swg21426014"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "IBM Content Navigator v2.0.3 is adding a .dat extension to a CSV file during Download action on a document.

This can be very helpful when a debug log level is needed to help isolate a problem or monitor behavior over a long period of time or can be used in production environment as DataPower only keeps a limited number of log files (the default is 3 files) in the file system in a rotational basis. \n\nCAUSE\nThe DataPower device has a finite amount of space to hold larger than average log files or long term logging needs in production environment. \n\nIt should be noted that if used while debugging at load or in a capacity issue, log events may be dropped. There is a prioritization of events within the device and client traffic always comes first. Log events dropped can be confirmed or counted from the Status>Log Targets menu in the WebGUI.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nConfigure a server daemon to listen and capture the DataPower devices events. First, this example shows how to create the log target sending events to a syslog destination. The other examples listed below will have their own strong points to be considered depending on the problem scenario. \n\n \n\nSyslog: \n\n* The syslog protocol operates over UDP which has no guarantee on packet delivery - a fast fire and forget method. \n\nTo create the new log target, go into the default domain: Objects > Log Targets \n\nConfigure the log target with settings as follows from the WebGUI: \n\n 1. Name the log target \n 2. Select Target Type of syslog \n 3. Fill in the Local Identifier with a descriptive string that may be used by a remote recipient to identify this specific log target \n 4. Enter the Remote Host Address and the Remote IP Port as in the screen shot wherex.x.x.x is the IP address of the remote syslog server that listens on port 514 \n 5. Take all other defaults\n\n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=1]  \n\n \n\nUnder the Event Subscriptions tab, you can select all and debug as indicated here: \n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=2] \n\n * \n * 6. Generate log events in the DataPower by using some transactions, for example by saving the configuration from the WebGUI or running some test load into a domain.\n\n\nSyslog-ng, will simply work over the TCP protocol to ensure the packet is delivered to the destination. The same consideration should be applied to a device under high load in that a log event could be dropped if not able to be wrote out to the network within time. \n\n \n\nNFS:\nAll NFS limitations apply from file size and permission settings. This is a more common approach using an NFS static mount to capture a log target and can allow for slightly more reliable messages to be logged. The limiting factor again is the speed of the network and NFS server response time. \n\n \n\nFile type: \n\nUsing a file type log target with a backup method as seen here:\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=3]\nThis will allow log events to quickly be written to a local file on the device's file system. Once the file reaches its set size a connection to the destination will upload the file from the device. This will upload with a unique time and date stamp on the uploaded file.\n\nThis is a useful method to capture sporadic problems. This is also useful for long running transactions that may span more than one file depending on device load.\n\n\nHTTP service:\nFinally a clever method that may be used in some senarios would be an HTTP service on the device.\nUsing an HTTP service configured in the following way,\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=4] \n\nOnce the file type log is created in the logtemp:/// directory, a client browser or wget type client can easily retrieve the file from the device. \n\nThis is very useful when there is no local or accessible remote log storage location to the device, due to firewall or network restrictions. \n\nThis is also removing the limitation of the device dropping the log event should it not be able to write the log event to the network. \n\nEach of the above methods are very useful and work better in some scenarios than others depending on the network, load, problem, and information needed. This is intended to be a guide to help you decide which method would be best for your scenario.", "document_id": "swg21269136"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "\n\nHi,\n\nWe noticed that a was application server uses 1,4 Go of memory at startup, we would like to understand what java classes are using most part of it.\n\nIs a Java profiler provided by default with WAS 8.0 ?

Where can I find the changes made in some of the WebSphere MQ headers fields in SMO reflected in the outbound WebSphere MQ message?\n\nNot all fields are propagated in the outbound message. You can find a list of the fields that are not passed on in the Using WebSphere MQ bindings in WebSphere ESB, Part 1: Manipulating MQ headers in WebSphere ESB using the XSL transformation primitive and WebSphere Integration Developer [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/0901_norton1/0901_norton1.html] developerWorks article.\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n3. I am receiving the exception below, what custom properties do I need to define?\ncom.ibm.websphere.sca.ServiceRuntimeException: MQ channel exit has not been invoked, ensure Connection Factory has Custom Properties set for exits.\n\nRefer to the Service Component Architecture modules and WebSphere MQ [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v6r1mx/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.soacore.612.doc/doc/cadm_scaandwmq.html] information center topic, which discusses the custom properties that you need to set. [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v6r1mx/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.soacore.612.doc/doc/cadm_scaandwmq.html]\n\nYou can find information on channel exits in the Using the WebSphere MQ messaging provider in WebSphere Application Server V7, Part 2: Using channel exits [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/techjournal/0906_leming/0906_leming.html] developerWorks article.

Can two WebSphere MQ exports or imports point to the same queue?\n\nMultiple imports or exports (or applications) using the same queue is not supported. It cannot be guaranteed which one would receive the response. There should be separate queues for each import and export. \n\nOne Import/Export per MQ queue configuration is required. This configuration is also true in a golden or silver topology cluster environment. In this environment, the callback queue for the Import is remote from the application and all cluster members have visibility of the callback information.\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n5. If WebSphere MQ goes down, would the listener port re-connect to WebSphere MQ automatically when it is available again? \n\nIf a WebSphere MQ resource goes down within the retry limits (the default is 5 times) then the listeners will reconnect. For example, if you try to put a message once and WebSphere MQ has gone down but then comes up on the 2nd, 3rd or 4th retry, it should reconnect. However, if the retry limit has been reached then after the listeners finish retrying, they are stopped and need to be started again manually. \nBack to top\n\n\n6. How can I dynamically change the JNDI resources for a WebSphere MQ import without the need to re-deploy the application?\n\nFollow the below steps: \n\n 1. Log into the administrative console.\n    \n    \n 2. Expand the Applications section.\n    \n    \n 3. Select SCA modules.\n    \n    \n 4. Select your module in question.\n    \n    \n 5. On the right side of the page, expand imports, find the import you are referring to and select it.\n    \n    \n 6. Expand 'Bindings'.\n    \n    \n 7. Click MQ.\n    \n    \n 8. Make changes to the JNDI and click apply.\n    \n    \n 9. Save.\n    Back to top\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n7. I am seeing the below exception, what does it mean? \ncom.ibm.websphere.sca.ServiceRuntimeException: No message is received from callback queue with \nselector=callbackID='CALLBACKMESSAGE_ID:....\n\nThe previous exception means that an MQ import is receiving a response message for a request that it did not send a request message for. \nBack to top\n\n\n8. Even though I have received a response for a request that was sent out, I see the error message below. Why am I seeing this error and what are the possible solutions?\ncom.ibm.websphere.sca.ServiceRuntimeException: No message is received from callback queue with selector=callbackID='CALLBACKMESSAGE_ID:....\n\nSee the following process that explains how the MQ/JMS Import works: \n\n 1. MQ/JMS Import sends the MQ/JMS Request message and in the same transaction it also puts a correlation message to a Service Integration Bus (SIBus) Queue.\n    \n    \n 2. MQ/JMS Import response listener receives the MQ/JMS response message off the response queue and, at this point, it attempts to get the correlation message off the SIBus queue. \n    \n    \n 3. The response listener waits for a maximum of 6 seconds for the correlation message to become available before throwing the exception that you see.\n    \n    \n 4. The MQ/JMS response message is then subject to the MQ retry and backout configuration as you have defined. \n\n\nTherefore, a possible cause for this error is a delay in the SIBus message being committed and becoming available. This scenario might be caused by performance issues of the underlying database used by SIBus. \n\nTo handle such situations you have the following options: \n 1. For the MQ/JMS Import, JMS callback destination has the default of persistence (Application). The MQ/JMS Import sends the correlation message as PERSISTENT; therefore, the message is persistent. \n    \n    \n    MQ/JMS Callback Connection Factory uses the default Quality of Service for persistent, so it maps persistent to \"Reliable Persistence\" for SIBus.\n    \n    \n    You can try changing this to \"Assured Persistent,\" which drives the persistence of the message on the same thread as the commit call. \n    \n    \n 2. Increase the retry values on the WebSphere MQ backout threshold and listener port to optimum values. In this case, the message is tried more than once before being sent to the backout queue.\n    \n    \n 3. Tune the database used by SIBus to avoid any performance issue. \n    Back to top\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n9. My listener port is stopping due to an invalid or \u201cbad\u201d message and further processing does not take place. How do I configure the listener port to not stop and continue processing?\n\nThese messages are known as poison messages.

The internal error message is: #{SelectionBean.asynchAction}: javax.faces.el.EvaluationException: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.sql.SQLException: The transaction is no longer active - status: 'Marked rollback.

If a transactional operation performed by RTS/DC takes longer than these timeouts to complete, the transaction is rolled back and the operation is not completed.\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nIf you perform time consuming operations in large repositories, you can increase the timeout value in the web.xml file of the RTS/DC EAR file (jrules-teamserver-<appserver>.ear\\teamserver.war\\WEB-INF) by changing the value of the property ilog.rules.teamserver.transaction.timeout. \n\n\nYou will find the property in the file web.xml defined as below:\n...\n<context-param>\n<description>Modify the timeout value that is associated with transactions (in seconds)</description>\n<param-name>ilog.rules.teamserver.transaction.timeout</param-name>\n<param-value>600</param-value>\n</context-param> \n... \n\nAnother place to look for are application server specific transaction timeout configurations. For example, for WebSphere Application Server, check the \"Maximum transaction timeout\" and increase it as needed as described here [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tjta_settlog.html].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration IBM Operational Decision Manager Platform Independent 7.5 Enterprise Business Integration IBM Operational Decision Manager Platform Independent 8.0.1, 8.0 Enterprise", "document_id": "swg21451229"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "When attempting to upgrade my Virtual DataPower Appliance from 5.0.0.8 firmware version to 6.0+ firmware versions, I receive a failure message.

The value of AutoCommit still defaults to false for an XA-enabled Oracle data source with the Oracle 9.2.0.5 (or lower) JDBC driver. \n\nIf you still need to use the Oracle 9.2.0.5 (or lower) JDBC driver), set the AutoCommit value to true after the connection is obtained from the OracleXADatasource, using the setAutoCommit method. \n\nIf your application runs in a global transaction, set the AutoCommit value to false when starting the global transaction.\n\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers Runtimes for Java Technology Java SDK", "document_id": "swg21113363"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Why AUTOMATIC value for NUM_IOSERVERS is changed after applying 10.5FP7?", "id": "DEV_Q050", "answers": [{"answer_id": 63325602, "document_id": "swg21991890", "question_id": "DEV_Q050", "text": "Yes, it is expected.

The following information presents some options for formulating an approach that best fits your environment.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nFirst, know your certificate material. It's not uncommon for newer certificates to be chained, so it is not a one for one replacement; the existing certificate on the DataPower appliance may need to be replaced by more than one certificate. Therefore, it is important to ensure you have the full certificate chain, as appropriate (i.e, the personal, intermediate and root certificates). Certificate authorities may send two certificates in the chain and expect the third one to be downloaded from their website. \n\n\nHere's a screenshot of a sample chain. Notice that you can check the 'Certification Path' tab if there are any remaining certificates in the chain. Also note the chain of \"Issued To\" and \"Issued By\" identities.\nExampleCertificateChain.jpg [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=2]ExampleCertificateChain.jpg [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=1]\n\n\nAs for the certificate configuration on DataPower, the appliance will reference the actual key and certificate files stored in the cert: directory by file name. Navigation in the WebGUI to the SSL Proxy Profile -> Crypto Profile -> Crypto Key and Certificate objects will show the current files referenced by the configuration.\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=3]\n\n\nFor example, your DataPower configuration may currently reference the existing files cert:///current-key.pem and cert:///current-cert.pem.\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=4]\n\nAs long as the replacement file(s) are NOT named the same as these files (i.e. the new ones are named cert:///new-key.pemand cert:///new-cert.pem for example), it is safe to load the new file(s) into the cert: directory at any time ahead of the replacement operation. Your existing configuration will not use the new files, so long as the Crypto Key and Certificate Objects still refer to the files associated with the expiring certificate (i.e. cert:///current-key.pem and cert:///current-cert.pem). \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=5]\n\nHaving both expiring and replacement files in the cert: directory at once allows for the capability to modify the configuration to point to the new files or revert it back to the expiring files relatively easily or to configure a new SSL Proxy Profile object that references the new files. The new SSL Proxy Profile could be used to test independently of the currently running configuration using a new test service such as an XML Firewall. \n\nYou can navigate directly to the key and certificate objects using these paths: \nObjects \u2192 Crypto Configuration \u2192 Crypto Certificate.\nObjects \u2192 Crypto Configuration \u2192 Crypto Key \n\nAnother view is from Control Panel -> Keys and Certificate Management.\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=6] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=6]\n\nEither way, note how the configuration ultimately references the files in the cert: directory and plan ahead for how you prefer to reference the new files. \n\nThey may be swapped out within the existing Crypto Configuration objects (i.e. update the objects to reference the new file(s) or to revert to the expiring ones as needed). \n\nAlternatively, a new separate set of Crypto Configuration objects that reference the new files may be created and replacement performed at the Crypto object level by updating the configuration to reference the new replacement Crypto Configuration objects.\n\nImportant Note: If the replacement certificate has the same file name of the expired certificate, you MUST disable/enable the certificate object in order to clear all cached references to the expired certificate.\n\nFor more information on certificates, refer to the product documentation specific to your firmware and appliance type.

The thread stack has a limited size and eventually its space will run out as the thread stack grows without bounds. \n\nSome traits of recursion: \n- Large thread stacks that appear to repeat \n- An infinite loop that continuously spawns off threads \n- Very large XML documents loaded into the Document Object Model (DOM) \n- JSP or servlets calling itself (usually by executing forward or include to itself) \n- Repeated calls in native functions \n\nIncreasing the thread stack size allows for larger thread stacks. However if the recursion continues to trigger a stack overflow, the next step is to identify what code is causing the recursion from javacores, thread dumps, or even system core files. \n\nA thread stack that indicates it's too large to display can be an indicator of stack overflow. This is especially true if the stack appears to repeat (such as recursive method calls). \n\nJIT/HotSpot Compiled Code \n\nThe JIT/HotSpot compiler (JIT) is designed to speed up the JVM execution times by compiling method calls. This can speed up execution time, but as more aggressive optimizations are used, this can inadvertently cause recursion, resulting in stack overflow or crash. The documents linked below explain how to debug JIT and HotSpot compiler issues:  * JIT Problem Determination for IBM SDK 5.0 and 6.0 using -Xjit [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21294023] \n * Debugging HotSpot failures on the Solaris and HP-UX operating environment [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21081179]\n\n\n\nDepleted Native Stack \nIt is almost guaranteed that a crash will occur if the native stack runs out of space. System cores can be used to identify long and possibly recursively looping native thread stacks. \n\nTo resolve, increase the native stack size (usually by adjusting the operating system limit for stack size) to accommodate the recursive native calls; however, identifying the recursive native calls will help determine the root cause of the stack overflow. \n\n\n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21162896&amp;aid=3] Back to top \n\n[http://www.ibm.com/i/v14/rules/dotted_blue_rule_443.gif] \n\n \n\nDetailed Configuration Options \n\nAdjusting the Stack Sizes (Xss and Xmso) options \nIf this does not work, you can adjust the stack sizes. Doubling the stack size is suggested as a first step; however, every thread that the JVM creates will consume memory. Be careful to not exhaust your physical and heap memory resources. \n\nFor every Java thread, there are two stacks that are utilized. One is for Java code for method calls, and the other is for native C code (on Solaris and HP-UX, only the native stack is utilized). These are adjustable and can be raised to provide more room on the stacks to prevent an overflow. \n\n * Maximum Thread Stack Size (-Xss)\n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  -Xss<size> \n * \n * <size>\n * \n * nn[k|m|g|K|M|G]\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * there is no distinction between native and thread stack sizes\n * \n * only \n * \n * HP-UX\n * \n * \n * \n *  -XX:MainThreadStackSize=<size> \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Initial Thread Stack Size (-Xiss)\n * \n * This is only for distributed platforms (AIX, Linux, Windows)\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  -Xiss<size> \n * \n * <size>\n * \n * nn[k|m|g|K|M|G]\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Initial Native Stack Size (-Xmso)\n * \n * This is only for distributed platforms (AIX, Linux, Windows)\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  -Xmso<size> \n * \n * <size>\n * \n * nn[k|m|g|K|M|G]\n * \n * \n * \n * \n\n\n\nDefault Values \nThis is a chart of default sizes for the various stack size arguments.

The Remote Receive Thread receives the notification\n   and sets some internal state to indicate that the attempt to get\n   a message failed. The MQ classes for Java or MQ classes for JMS\n   running on the application thread are made aware of the state\n   change and throw an exception back to the application.\n   \n   If the Remote Receive Thread changed the internal state a few\n   milliseconds before the MQ classes for Java or MQ classes for\n   JMS running on the application thread checked the state, then it\n   was possible for the MQ classes for Java or MQ classes for JMS\n   running on the application thread to see the old value rather\n   than the updated one. This meant that, if the Remote Receive\n   Thread had changed the internal state to indicate that a\n   security error had occurred, then the application thread would\n   incorrectly think that the attempt to get a message failed due\n   to reason code 2033 (MQRC_NO_MSG_AVAILABLE) rather than reason\n   code 2063 (MQRC_SECURITY_ERROR). If this happened:\n   \n   - The MQ classes for Java would incorrectly throw an MQException\n   containing reason code 2033 (MQRC_NO_MSG_AVAILABLE) back to the\n   application.\n   - The MQ classes for JMS methods:\n   \n       - MessageConsumer.receive()\n       - MessageConsumer.receive(long)\n       - MessageConsumer.receiveNoWait()\n   \n   would return null back to the application, indicating that there\n   was no message on the destination.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\n *  The way the MQ classes for Java or MQ classes for JMS store the\n   internal state information about whether an attempt to get a\n   message was successful or failed has been changed to ensure that\n   the application thread always reads the most up-to-date value.\n   This means that:\n   \n   - If an application using the MQ classes for Java calls one of\n   the methods:\n   \n       - MQQueue.get(MQMessage)\n       - MQQueue.get(MQMessage, MQGetMessageOptions)\n       - MQQueue.get(MQMessage, MQGetMessageOptions, int)\n   \n   to get a message, and is unable to do so due to a security\n   error, an MQException containing reason code 2063\n   (MQRC_SECURITY_ERROR) will be thrown back to the application.\n   \n   - If an application that is using the MQ classes for JMS calls\n   one of the following methods:\n   \n       - MessageConsumer.receive()\n       - MessageConsumer.receive(long)\n       - MessageConsumer.receiveNoWait()\n   \n   to get a message from a JMS destination, and is unable to do so\n   due to a security error, a JMSException will be thrown back to\n   the application. The JMSException will contain a linked\n   exception containing reason code 2063 (MQRC_SECURITY_ERROR)\n   \n   ---------------------------------------------------------------\n   The fix is targeted for delivery in the following PTFs:\n   \n   Version    Maintenance Level\n   v8.0       8.0.0.8\n   v9.0 CD    9.0.4\n   v9.0 LTS   9.0.0.3\n   \n   The latest available maintenance can be obtained from\n   'WebSphere MQ Recommended Fixes'\n   http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006037 [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006037]\n   \n   If the maintenance level is not yet available information on\n   its planned availability can be found in 'WebSphere MQ\n   Planned Maintenance Release Dates'\n   http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006309 [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006309]\n   ---------------------------------------------------------------\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nTEMPORARY FIX\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nAPAR INFORMATION\n * APAR NUMBER\n   IT21642\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT NAME\n   WMQ BASE MULTIP\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT ID\n   5724H7251\n   \n   \n * REPORTED RELEASE\n   800\n   \n   \n * STATUS\n   CLOSED PER\n   \n   \n * PE\n   NoPE\n   \n   \n * HIPER\n   NoHIPER\n   \n   \n * SPECIAL ATTENTION\n   NoSpecatt / Xsystem\n   \n   \n * SUBMITTED DATE\n   2017-07-31\n   \n   \n * CLOSED DATE\n   2017-08-24\n   \n   \n * LAST MODIFIED DATE\n   2017-08-30\n   \n   \n\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED FROM ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n * APAR IS SYSROUTED TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n\nFIX INFORMATION\n * FIXED COMPONENT NAME\n   WMQ BASE MULTIP\n   \n   \n * FIXED COMPONENT ID\n   5724H7251\n   \n   \n\nAPPLICABLE COMPONENT LEVELS\n * R800 PSY\n   UP", "document_id": "swg1IT21642"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I need to understand details regarding Security Bulletin: Apache Commons FileUpload Vulnerabilities in IBM WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition(CVE-2016-3092).

This process may not work for all files and is a general practice. \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe following is a list of things to do to fix or clean up duplicate files without restoring QUSRSYS. It is recommended to have a good backup of QUSRSYS before starting cleanup. It is possible that restricted state may be needed to ensure there are no locks on the files in QUSRSYS when removing duplicate files. \n\nNote: This issue is user induced when someone has performed a RSTLIB with ALWOBJDIF(*ALL) specified. The user must determine the best method for cleaning up the duplicate files. Involving IBM in this requires a consulting or customized service agreement. For more information about having this work done under a customized service agreement, refer to the following document:\n\nN1021786: IBMi Customized Services [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021786]\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021786 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1021786]\n\nThe WRKF command can be used to display and manipulate the needed files.\n\nYou should do the following: \n\n1. Make a list of the logical files and what physical files they point to. 2. Look at the physical files and determine which ones have data. Make a note of those files. 3. If you have a good logical file pointing to a good physical file, there is no need to do anything. 4. If you have a good logical file pointing to a wrong physical file, you should do the following: \n\no If the wrong physical file contains the data, delete the correct named file, and rename the wrong file to the correct file name (the logical file will follow the rename).\n\no If the correct physical contains the data, type CLRPFM on the wrong file. Then copy the file of the correct physical file to the wrong physical file with the CPYF command. Delete the correct physical file, and rename the wrong physical file to the correct physical file name. 5. If you have a wrong logical file pointing to a good physical file, make a backup of a good logical file, delete the correctly named logical file, rename the wrong logical file to the correct name, and correct the description. 6. If you have a wrong logical file pointing to a wrong physical file, delete both files. This takes time because you must chart out what the problems are. \n\nYou can use the DSPDBR command on a physical file to see what logical file is attached to it. \n\nNotes: \n1.

In both cases no data is collected. Note that when KILL_AFTER_TIMEOUT is set, only the script defined in property file is killed and not child processes (if any) spawned by the script. This feature is not supported by Solaris and Windows 32 bit OS agents and any timing out scripts are abandoned. \n\n\nOutput rows returned by a script are parsed. The script returns a standard output (called hereafter as first token). When the script returns more values in the output row they are added as additional tokens for a maximum of 5 strings, 5 integers and 5 floats following a predefined syntax as described below:\n\n- OUTPUT_TYPE (STRING|INTEGER|FLOAT - Optional - default string). It defines the type of the first token returned by each row of the script;\nOUTPUT_TYPE can be:\n1. STRING (default): strings up to 2048 characters. When used, the \"Standard_Output_String\" attribute of KXX_Custom_Scripts_Runtime is filled in by the first token.\n2. INTEGER: allows getting numeric values between -9223372036854775806 and 9223372036854775806. When used, the \"Standard_Output_Integer\" attribute of KXX_Custom_Scripts_Runtime is filled in by the first token.\n3. FLOAT: allows getting numeric values between -92233720368547758.06 and 92233720368547758.06,(with 2 decimal\nprecision). When used, the \"Standard_Output_Float\" attribute of KXX_Custom_Scripts_Runtime is filled in by the first token.\n\n- TOKEN_TYPES (STRING|INTEGER|FLOAT - Optional).\nIt defines the output type of additional tokens after the first one. The user can define a maximum of 5 strings, 5 integers and 5 floats. It is a list of types separated by commas:\n<token_type>,<token_type>,\u2026\ntoken_type can be empty or one from (case insensitive):\n- STRING or S\n- INTEGER or I\n- FLOAT or F\nIf <token_type> is empty, the corresponding token is skipped.\nExamples of the same valid layouts:\n- TOKEN_TYPES=S,I,S,,,F,,F,F\n- TOKEN_TYPES=String,integer,S,,,Float,,f,FLOAT\n\n- TOKEN_LABELS (STRING - maximum 16 characters each label - Optional). \nIt defines the labels of the tokens defined in TOKEN_TYPES.

It is ignored if TOKEN_TYPES is not set. Empty value (blank) is accepted as separator and multiple consecutive blanks in output rows are considered as a single one.\n\n\nThe following two parameters allow you to filter the rows output of a script; they are applied by the OS agent only to the first token and they must be used together:\n\n- FILTER_VALUE (Optional).\nThe value used for comparison. It is required if FILTER_OPERATOR is defined.\nIf the OUTPUT_TYPE is a string, the filter value must reflect exactly the string value returned by the script that is intended to be filtered, without any additional quotes (no wildcards allowed).\n- FILTER_OPERATOR (Optional).\nThe operator used for the comparison. It is required if FILTER_VALUE is defined. Accepted FILTER_OPERATOR values include:\n= (equal to)\n!= (different from)\n> (bigger than) only for numeric type\n>= (not lower than) only for numeric type\n< (lower than) only for numeric type\n<= (not bigger than) only for numeric type\n\n\n\n5.

Attach API allows your application to connect to\n   another virtual machine (the \"target\"). Your application can\n   then load an agent application into the target virtual machine,\n   for example to perform tasks such as monitoring status.\n   \n   Code for agent applications, such as JMX agents or JVMTI agents,\n   is normally loaded during virtual machine startup by specifying\n   special startup parameters. Requiring startup parameters might\n   not be convenient for using agents on applications that are\n   already running, such as WebSphere&#169; Application Servers. Using\n   the Java Attach API, lets you load an agent at any time by\n   specifying the process ID of the target virtual machine. The\n   Attach API capability is sometimes called \"late attach\".\n   \n   On z/OS, the Attach API is enabled by default for Java 5 SR 10\n   and later.\n   \n   By default, the target virtual machine is identified by its\n   process ID. To use a different target, change the system\n   property com.ibm.tools.attach.id; for example:\n         -Dcom.ibm.tools.attach.id=<process_ID>\n   The target process also has a human-readable \"display name\". By\n   default, the display name is the process ID. To change the\n   default display name, use the com.ibm.tools.attach.displayName\n   system property. The ID and display name cannot be changed after\n   the application has started.\n   \n   The Attach API creates working files in a common directory\n   called .com_ibm_tools_attach, which is created in the system\n   temporary directory. The system property java.io.tmpdir holds\n   the value of the system temporary directory. On non-Windows&#169;\n   systems, the system temporary directory is typically /tmp. To\n   modify the working directory, use the Java system property\n   com.ibm.tools.attach.directory; for example:\n         -Dcom.ibm.tools.attach.directory=/working\n   To prevent use of the Attach API capability, set the\n   com.ibm.tools.attach.enable system property to the value no; for\n   example:\n         -Dcom.ibm.tools.attach.enable=no\n   On heavily loaded system, applications might experience timeouts\n   when attempting to connect to target applications. The default\n   timeout is 120 seconds. Use the com.ibm.tools.attach.timeout\n   system property to specify a different timeout value in seconds;\n   for example, to timeout after 60 seconds:\n         -Dcom.ibm.tools.attach.timeout=60\n   A timeout value of zero indicates an indefinite wait.\n   For JMX applications, you might need to disable authentication\n   by editing the\n   <JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib/management/management.properties file.\n   Set the following properties to disable authentication in JMX:\n        com.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false\n        com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false\n   An unsuccessful attempt to invoke the Attach API results in one\n   of the following exceptions:\n        com.sun.tools.attach.AgentLoadException\n        com.sun.tools.attach.AgentInitializationException\n        java.io.IOException\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\n *  No update\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nTEMPORARY FIX\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nAPAR INFORMATION\n * APAR NUMBER\n   PK96970\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT NAME\n   JAVA 5 Z/OS 31\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT ID\n   620500105\n   \n   \n * REPORTED RELEASE\n   500\n   \n   \n * STATUS\n   CLOSED DOC\n   \n   \n * PE\n   NoPE\n   \n   \n * HIPER\n   NoHIPER\n   \n   \n * SPECIAL ATTENTION\n   NoSpecatt\n   \n   \n * SUBMITTED DATE\n   2009-09-23\n   \n   \n * CLOSED DATE\n   2009-10-09\n   \n   \n * LAST MODIFIED DATE\n   2009-10-09\n   \n   \n\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED FROM ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n * APAR IS SYSROUTED TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n\nFIX INFORMATION\n\nAPPLICABLE COMPONENT LEVELS", "document_id": "swg1PK96970"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I need to understand details regarding Security Bulletin: IBM Integration Bus is affected by Web UI security vulnerability (CVE-2017-1694).

Before debugging any event related issues, verify that the event producer is setup to send events to WebSphere Business Monitor at the application level.\n    \n    For example: The following images illustrate how to enable events for a BPEL process as a whole and for a subcomponent of the BPEL process in WebSphere Integration Developer.\n    \n    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013015&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013015&aid=1] \n    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013015&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013015&aid=2] \n    \n 2. Verify the Event Producer RunTime ( BPEL runtime in this case) is configured correctly to produce events to the CEI.  1. For a stand-alone server, select the server from the Application Servers panel, and click Business Flow Manager > Business Process Choreographer Containers. Verify that the CEI logging options are selected.\n        \n        [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013015&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013015&aid=3] \n        \n     2. For a clustered environment, select the cluster from the Clusters panel, and click TestEnv.AppTarget and then click Business Process Choreographer Containers. Click cluster_name to select the cluster where Business Process Containers are installed. Verify the CEI logging options are selected.\n        \n        [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013015&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013015&aid=4] \n        \n    \n    \n 3. Start a process instance in your BPC Explorer and verify that the events have been generated by the Business Flow Manager. Launch the Common Base Events Browser and set the Event Filter Properties to get the events between a Time Range. Then click Get Events, and you should see events that have been submitted recently.\n    \n    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013015&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013015&aid=5] \n    \n 4. Verify your CEI server is enabled for your infrastructure. To verify the CEI server is enabled, navigate to Event Service > Event Services. Verify the default CEI server is configured for the appropriate scope and that the JNDI name is configured properly for your environment.\n    \n    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013015&aid=6] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013015&aid=6] \n    \n 5. Verify that an event group has been created for each of the monitor models you have deployed. From the Event Services panel, click Default Common Event Infrastructure event server, and verify the proper event groups are listed. Verify the Event Selector String is correct for each monitor model. If the event selector string is not correct, the CEI server will filter out the incoming events and those events would not be distributed to the event consumer.\n    \n    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013015&aid=7] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013015&aid=7] <br>\n    \n    b. If you are using a Queue ByPass Setup for Monitor 6.2 or higher , make sure the INCOMING_EVENTS table has been created on your WebSphere Business Monitor Database.\n    You should be able to see the table under the schema with the same name as your deployed Monitor Model\n    \n    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013015&aid=8] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013015&aid=8]\n    \n    \n    [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013015&amp;aid=9] \n 6. Verify the queues are correct for each monitor model. The common base events must arrive at the queue before the events can be consumed by WebSphere Business Monitor. To configure the queues for each monitor model, complete the following steps:  1. Stop the monitor model.\n        \n        \n     2. If you are in a non-production environment, clear all existing events in the queue. If you are in a production environment, note the existing queue depth. The events are listed in the following location in the administrative console: Buses > bus_name > Destinations > destination_name > Queue points\n        \n        \n     3. Start a process instance to send events for your monitor model.\n        \n        \n     4. Verify the queue depth. The Current message depth is listed on the Runtime tab. If the queue depth increases, the events are being produced correctly and are ready to be consumed. If the queue depth does not increase, verify your service integration bus link is properly configured, and repeat the previous steps.\n        \n        [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013015&aid=10] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27013015&aid=10] e. For the Queue ByPass Setup the procedure remains the same , except that the database table INCOMING_EVENTS table has to be checked for any increase\n        in number of records compared to the messages on the Queues for the Queue Based Setup.\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n 7.

If not, then enabling the server for TLS 1.2 will not have any effect. \n\n \n\nOn the IBM iOS side, verify that Technology Refresh 6 or newer has been installed by confirming the *INSTALLED Level of the SF99707 Group PTF.\n\n\nStep 1) Enter the command CHGSYSVAL QSSLPCL and remove *OPSYS (which equates to *SSLV3 and *TLSV1). Then list the protocols that are desired to be supported. To just add the latest TLS protocol support, enter:\n\n*TLSV1.2\n*TLSV1.1\n*TLSV1\n*SSLV3 \n\n Note: Ensure that the protocol lists are concurrent. Do not skip a protocol.\n\n\nStep 2) Enter the command DSPSYSVAL QSSLCSLCTL and verify it is set to *OPSYS. If set to *USRDFN, then the SSL Administration for this system is customizing the list of ciphers. If this is the case, enter CHGSYSVAL QSSLCSL to verify the ciphers supported and include the new ciphers:\n\n\n *RSA_AES_256_CBC_SHA256 \n\n *RSA_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 \n\n \n\nStep 3) Open Digital Certificate Manager (DCM) from the IBM i Tasks option on the Welcome Panel of the IBM Navigator for i port 2001 interface, and log into the *SYSTEM keystore.\n\n\nStep 4) From the left navigation pane, expand Manage Applications and then select Update Application Definition.\n\n\nStep 5) Select the Server radio button and then select the Continue button.\n\n\nStep 6) in the list of Server Applications, find and select the radio button for IBM i TCP/IP Telnet Server and then select the Update Application Definition button.\n\n\nStep 7) Change the SSL Protocols from *PGM to Define Protocols Suppored. Check the protocols desired for this application to support or use. This list should match or be a subset of the QSSLPCL System Value. For example: TLS 1.2, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.0 and SSLV3.\n\n\nStep 8) Change SSL Cipher Specification Options from *PGM to Define Cipher Specification List. The first six ciphers in the list should be enabled and are a good starting point. But you may want to set RSA_AES_256_CBC_SHA256 and RSA_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 as the first two in the list. RSA_AES_128_CBC_SHA is a good cipher to have listed third as it supports more than just the TLS 1.2 protocol.\n\n\nStep 10) At the bottom of the screen, click the Apply button.\n\n\nAt the next restart of the Telnet Server, it will be enabled for TLS 1.2 and prefer the TLS 1.2 specific ciphers. \n\n \n\nAccess for Windows is enabled for TLS 1.2 in Service Pack SI50567 for IBM i Access for Windows r7.1. You could also test the Telnet Server by using the IBM i v7.1 Telnet Client. The same system values have to be set to enable TLS 1.2 protocols and ciphers. But in DCM, update the Application Definition, chose Application type of \"Client\", then the IBM i Telnet Client and make the same protocol and cipher changes. Start a new interactive job and telnet to the destination telnet server.

The error will be generated in the log when the unused protocol is tried. For this situation, the error can be ignored. However, the protocol can be set through the Taskmaster tab in Application Manager to eliminate this cause of the error. \n * Verify that the Rulerunner service is running under an account that has at least read permissions to the application folder. \n * With multiple threads all attempting to establish connections, some attempts may fail because the server is momentarily busy processing another request.

Similarly,\n   DRS Connector allows only for values \"10\" and \"11\" to be\n   specified for the \"Oracle\" property under \"Variant\" property\n   when \"Database type\" property is set to value \"Oracle\". The two\n   supported values in the two connectors suggest that\n   theconnectors assume the Oracle Client installation on the\n   Information Server engine tier to be one of 10gR2 or 11g(R1/R2).\n    The two connectors should allow for values \"12c\" and \"12\",\n   respectively, and should in that case assume Oracle Client\n   installation 12c.\n   \n   Limitations in Oracle Connector and DRS Connector exist in\n   respect to processing VARCHAR2, NVARCHAR2 and RAW values with\n   extended sizes up to 32767 bytes when connecting to Oracle\n   Database 12c with extended maximum size enabled for these column\n   types. For example, when unbounded VarChar columns is present on\n   the input link to the Oracle Connector stage or DRS Connector\n   stage, and a value larger than 4000 bytes is provided for that\n   column, the connector will fail to insert it to the database.\n   Similarly in this scenario, if the connector is configured to\n   automatically create target table, it will create a table with\n   the length of 4000 instead of 32767.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nLOCAL FIX\n *  To connect to Oracle Database 12c with Oracle Connector and DRS\n   Connector, the value \"11g\" and \"11\" can be specified,\n   respectively. The installed Oracle Client version in this case\n   should be 11gR1 or 11gR2. It is also possible to use Oracle\n   Client version 12c in this case, but since the two connectors\n   will explicitly try to dynamically link to the Oracle Client\n   library from version 11gR1 or 11gR2, then depending on the\n   platform and the Oracle Client distribution type in place (Full,\n    Instant Basic, Instant Basic Lite), it may be necessary to\n   manually create a symbolic link for the Oracle Client 11g client\n    library to point to the Oracle Client 12c library, for example:\n   ln -s libclntsh.so.12.1 libclntsh.so.11.1\n   When such a symbolic link is present, the Oracle Connector and\n   DRS Connector will dynamically link to Oracle Client 12c client\n   library by the means of the provided symbolic link.\n   \n   To work around the limitations in respect to processing\n   VARCHAR2, NVARCHAR2 and RAW values with extended sizes up to\n   32767 bytes when connecting to Oracle Database 12c with extended\n   maximum size enabled for these column types, the environment\n   variables CC_ORA_UNBOUNDED_STRING_LENGTH and\n   CC_ORA_UNBOUNDED_BINARY_LENGTH cab be set. By setting these\n   environment variables to value 32767, the connector will assume\n   the maximum size in bytes of 32767 for VarChar/NVarChar and\n   VarBinary link column value, respectively, instead of assuming\n   the maximum size of 4000. When automatically creating tables\n   based on unbounded VarChar, NVarChar and VarBinary input link\n   columns, the connector will create tables with the VARCHAR2,\n   NVARCHAR2 and RAW table columns of size 32767, instead of the\n   size 4000, 4000 and 2000, respectively. For this workaround to\n   apply it is necessary to use Oracle Client 12c installation,\n   because Oracle Client 11gR2 installations and earlier will not\n   allow for processing atomic VARCHAR2, NVARCHAR2 and RAW values\n   larger than 4000 bytes even if the\n   CC_ORA_UNBOUNDED_STRING_LENGTH and\n   CC_ORA_UNBOUNDED_BINARY_LENGTH variables are set to accomodate\n   such larger values. The Oracle error codes that will be returned\n   in this case include ORA-01461 or ORA-24920.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nPROBLEM SUMMARY\n\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\n\nTEMPORARY FIX\n\nCOMMENTS\n *  The Oracle 12c support for Oracle Connector is now available in\n   Information Server version 11.5.

Buffering mode Buffer is a better choice when initially configuring data collection, or when processing high volumes, particularly when using multiple ITCAM SOA subscribers. \n\nSYMPTOM\nIf ITCAM SOA data collection is not running, DataPower will discard metrics for transactions if Buffering Mode is set to Discard. For example, a dp:wsm-agent-append() function call may receive result \"no record\" in a stylesheet enabling metrics for a Multi-Protocol gateway. Result \"no record\" is returned because there were no subscribers to collect the data written by the stylesheet function. If Buffering Mode = Buffer is used, the metrics will be recorded in anticipation that the next time ITCAM SOA collection is started, the metrics can be collected. \n\nIn high volume scenarios, particularly when multiple ITCAM SOA subscribers are configured, setting Buffering Mode = Buffer simplifies how subscriptions are handled. When a subscriber collects data, all the DataPower records that have been written to the Web Services Management buffer are collected. \nWith the default setting of Discard, complications can occur if a new subscriber replaces a former subscriber, or if high volumes cause the Complete Records Count to reach the configured Maximum Record Size limit. Set Buffering Mode = Buffer and collection can proceed.\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\n \n\n 1. Select Status > Web Service > WSM Agent Status in the DataPower WebGUI. The WSM Agent Status shows the number of active subscribers and a count of metrics records that were lost or are complete. \n 2. Make a note of the complete record count; it should have a value less than 3000, the default maximum record setting. This setting is configurable by selecting Objects > Device Management > Web Services Management Agent. \n 3. Select Refresh multiple times on the WSM Agent Status page and monitor the complete record count. When an ITCAM SOA collection completes, the complete record count should reset to a low number, and increase again with each Refresh of this page until the next ITCAM SOA collection completes.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nSelect Objects > Device Management > Web Services Management Agent and change Buffering Mode to Buffer to resolve either of two issues: \n\n *  If active subscribers and complete records have a zero value, the lost record count may increase with each refresh of this page. Records that are candidates for data collection are being discarded because there are no subscribers to collect them. A non-zero complete record count that remains static indicates that records are not being collected. A complete record count of 3000 may indicate there was an issue associated with high volume. An Active Subscribers count greater than one may indicate that managing multiple subscribers may be be a contributor to the problem. You can review page Status > Management > WSM Subscriber Status to see details on the subscribers. \n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n#Configuring data collection: DataPower SOA Appliance [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v3r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.itcamsoa.doc/kd4inmst138.htm#configdatapower]\nConfiguring a DataPower user for ITCAM SOA data collect [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21394718]\n\n\n \n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliances General Firmware 3.7.3, 3.7.2, 3.7.1, 3.7.0, 3.6.1 Edition Independent", "document_id": "swg21394557"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I need to understand details regarding Security Bulletin: WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit and IBM Integration Toolkit cannot connect to a remote WebSphere Message Broker broker or IBM Integration Bus node with a TLS-compliant cipher (CVE-2015-0118).

If you go top\n   down or bottom up, we come to the same situation.  Details the\n   steps performed during analysis,\n   \n   1.  Top down.  Create BO \"BO\" with a parameter \"foo\" that points\n   to a BO \"BOChild\".  Define the \"foo\" parameter as a list with a\n   wrap list = true.\n   2.  Bring into IID.  What gets generated is BO.xsd and\n   BOChild.xsd with 3 types:  BO, BOChild, ArrayOfBOChild.  Note in\n   PD, there are only two types:  BO and BOChild.  The array is\n   artifically created and hence not represented.\n   3.  Create an AIS to reference the BO and publish back to the\n   repository.  This will cause the ArrayOfBOChild to be mirrored\n   and show up as a type in PD.  (I believe you can do any other\n   step as long as the BO is \"processed\")\n   4.  Modify the BO or ArrayOfBOChild will cause the splitting\n   logic to occur which is the correct behaviour (since both BO and\n   ArrayOfBOChild types point to the same BO.xsd).  The consequence\n   is that you will have two ArrayOfBOChild created.  One for the\n   ArrayOfBOChild.xsd and the other due to BO.xsd having a list\n   that is a wrapped list.\n   \n   Note:\n   Deleting the ArrayOfBOChild from PD and then modified the BO\n   followed by a refresh from IID, the issue is not seen.\n   (Essentially doing step 4 with the condition of deleting the\n   type that was created from the wrap list)\n   \n   Recommendations:\n   1.  Recommend to not use wrap list when doing top down.\n   2.  Have logic in the importer to not mirror the type if it is a\n   wrap list consumed in another type.  This should address bottom\n   up scenarios and also step 3 above.  Note that the existing\n   WebServices import used in PD also expose the wrapped type.\n   3.  In the mean time, if the user does see ArrayOf BOs that get\n   created tell them that they are artificial and should be deleted\n   to not cause confusion.\n   4.

Backup queue server CPU usage becomes significant at\na queue depth of 15000, with CPU use reaching 100% at a queue\ndepth of approx. 38000 messages.\n\nAPAR IC70947 - qmproc.ini file validation does not detect incorrect CPU syntax.\nCPU lists in the qmproc.ini file that do not use comma\ncharacters to separate CPU numbers in the list are ignored, but\nthey are not reported as an error. This can lead to unexpected\nCPU assignements for WMQ processes.\n\nAPAR IC71839 - RESET QUEUE STATISTICS PCF returns incorrect values.\nWhen using WebSphere MQ v5.3 for HP NonStop Server PCF command\nReset Queue Statistics, intermittently some of the values\nassociated with a queue will not be returned correctly.\n* HighQDepth - The maximum number of messages on the queue\nsince the statistics were last reset.\n(parameter identifier: MQIA_HIGH_Q_DEPTH).\n* MsgEnqCount - The number of messages enqueued (the number of\nMQPUT calls to the queue), since the\nstatistics were last reset.\n(parameter identifier: MQIA_MSG_ENQ_COUNT).\n* MsgDeqCount - The number of messages dequeued (the number of\nMQGET calls to the queue), since the\nstatistics were last reset.\n(parameter identifier: MQIA_MSG_DEQ_COUNT).\n\nIncorrect values may also be returned incorrectly for the\ncommand Inquire Queue Status\n* LastGetTime - Time at which the last message was\ndestructively read from the queue\n(parameter identifier: MQCACF_LAST_GET_TIME).\n* LastPutTime - Time at which the last message was\nsuccessfully put to the queue\n(parameter identifier: MQCACF_LAST_PUT_TIME).\n\nAPAR IC71912 - MQMC Channel menu display shows incorrect channel status.\nIn some instances, the MQMC Channel Menu display will not\nshow a change in channel status, and attempts to refresh the\nscreen or recycle the MQS-MQMSVR Pathway server do not correct\nthe problem.

The default size of the buffer is \n512K, this is sufficient for most configurations. If the buffer \nsize is insufficient, the queue manager reports FDCs from \nrrmHPNSSPutMetaPacket that indicate the present size of the\nbuffer and the size demanded.\n\nThe buffer size is configured using an environment variable, \nAMQ_CLUSTER_METABUFFER_KILOBYTES. To change the value, the \nenvironment variable should be specified in the \n\"RepositoryManager\" stanza of the qmproc.ini file of the queue\nmanager using the following syntax:\n\nEnv0n=AMQ_CLUSTER_METABUFFER_KILOBYTES=x\n\nWhere \"n\" is the number of the environment variable, and \"x\" is\nthe required new size of the buffer in kilobytes. In a default\nconfiguration, environment variables are not present in the \nRepositoryManager stanza, hence \"n\" will be 1. If the \nconfiguration has existing environment variables specified in\nthis stanza, the value of \"n\" selected should be the next \navailable value. \n\nAPAR IC75356 - Partial repository queue managers in complex configurations\nwhere applications connected to the partial repository queue\nmanager attempt to open large numbers of nonexistant objects\ncan suffer from a build up of subscription objects on the \nSYSTEM.CLUSTER.REPOSITORY.QUEUE such that the TMF lock limits\nfor the volume containing the queue file are breached when the\nqueue is reconciled.

This can\nresult in the queue manager not acting as a repository for\none or more clusters, or other queue managers in the cluster\nnot recognizing that a given queue manager is a repository\nfor the cluster.\n\nAPAR IZ20546 - The repository manager process (amqrrmfa) consumes high CPU\nresources on an hourly basis for several minutes, and\napplications are unable to issue messaging MQ API calls\nduring this period. The problem is observed only in \nconfigurations where clustered queue manager aliases are\nused and they resolve to more than 50 destinations.\n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were\nalso released with V5.3.1.8:\n\n1228 - COBOL Binding library mqmcb does not contain VPROC information\n1378 - FDC's cut as a result of errors from PATHWAY SPI operations do\nnot report the associated Guardian error code \n1566 - WMQ service installation tool svcmqm does not correctly detect\nand report that files it is attempting to modify are in use,\nas is the case where WMQ applications are still runnning. \n1606 - Certain FDCs containing comment text have the comment text\ntruncated \n1710 - In some cases on heavily loaded systems, the EC re-allocates\nan MCA that has already been told to terminate. This results in\nFDC's cut with probe EC134000, from eclDeallocMCA.\n2534 - WMQ service installation tool svcmqm does not log some aspects\nof its progress, making diagnosing some installation problems\ndifficult\n2856 - WMQ service installation tool should not attempt SECURE\noperations in installations where SAFEGUARD is enabled\n2943 - crtmqm does not correctly handle validation of the command line\nif a specified CPU number is invalid\n3037 - If the var/mqm/errors directory contains non-mqm user files \nthe WMQ service data collection tool, sdcp, does not capture the \nMQM group FDC and ZZSA files.\n3128 - WMQ Service data collection tool, sdcp, does not capture VPROC \nof the AF_UNIX R2 socket process\n\n\nThe following changes were released in FixPack V5.3.1.7:\n\nAPAR IC65774 - Under given conditions, the response time measured for MQGET\noperations when using SSL activated channels with multi-threaded\nMCA agents are found to be longer than that measured when using \nSSL activated channels with unthreaded MCA agents. This problem \nis seen with both distributed and cluster queue managers. \nMoreover, this problem does not occur prior to WMQ V5.3.1.5 \nrelease. A DELAY was introduced as part of an APAR(IC57744) fix\nin WMQ V5.3.1.5 release for mutli-threaded SSL channels which\ncaused this difference in measured response time. The problem is\nnow rectified in this release. \n\nAPAR IC67032 - Improvement to LQMA FDC during MQCONN processing. At times, when\napplication dies during MQCONN processing, LQMA's generate FDCs\nfor this rather unusual event to let the user take any \ncorrective action and/or find the root cause. The problem can \noccur with a standard bound application in a very narrow timing\nwindow when the application connects with the LQMA agent but \ndies before the LQMA gets a chance to read the incoming message\nfrom the application. When LQMA detects this situation, it \ncleans up and generates an FDC. But unfortunately, the FDC does\nnot contain the application information. To let the user \nidentify the mis-behaving application and to possibly take\ncorrective action, LQMA FDC will be updated to include \napplication information. The updated FDC will contain the\nfollowing information :\n\nComment1 :- Application died during MQCONN Processing.\nComment2 :- Application: <Application PID> \n\nAPAR IC67057 - Unused LQMA agents(processes or threads) are found during MQCONN \nprocessing. During MQCONN processing if a standard bound \napplication fails to connect successfully to an allocated LQMA\nprocess or thread (depending on your configuration), then that\nLQMA process or thread remains in a hanging state for ever and\ndo not get re-used by Execution Controller for any further \nMQCONN processing. If an LQMA agent process ever goes into this \n\"limbo\" state, ecasvc utility shows \n\"Allocated, Pending Registration\" flag if it is unthreaded LQMA \nor a positive number against \"Conns Pending\" flag if it is a \nmulti threaded LQMA. If this problem occurrs multiple times, \nthen depending on the user configuration, it might lead to LQMA \nresource problems where Execution Controller will run out of \navailable LQMA agents to serve application MQCONN requests.\n\nAPAR IC65966 - runmqsc <queue manager name> causes FDC on a CPU due to missing\nOSS shared memory files (shm.x.x) for that CPU. Due to a yet\nunknown reason, the queue manager shared memory files for a\nparticular CPU on the system are deleted even when the queue\nmanager is in running state. This prevents any new MQ connection\nrequests from succeeding for the same queue manager on the\naffected CPU. This patch contains changes that will better\nprotect WMQ shared memory files and will prevent accidental\ndeletion of files by WMQ programs. The changes in this patch\nwill also report any such incidence by producing FDC files. The\nFDC file produced by this detection mechanism will contain the\nfollowing information :\nComment1 :- xcsIC_QUEUE_MANAGER_POOL being destroyed.\n\nAPAR IC67569 - When WMQ Queue Server detects an error due to invalid context\ndata during the completion of a TMF transaction started by the\nQueue Server for a PUT or GET no-syncpoint persistent message\noperation, it marks the message on the queue object as \naccessible. This causes the Queue Server to FDC with \n\"Record not found\" on any subsequent MQGET operation to retrieve\nthe same message. The particular message on the queue that has \nthis problem remains in this limbo state forever and can not be\nretrieved. However other messages on the same queue that do not\nhave this problem can be retrieved without any problem using \ntheir msgids. The Queue Server has been revised to correct this\nbehavior such that detection of inconsistent context data during\nMQPUT/MQGET is logged in the form of an FDC but is otherwise \ncommitted as a normal operation. This will resolve the problem\nof MQGET failing on the retrieval of the message.\n\nAPAR IC68569 - Channel server FDCs during starting/stopping of channels. The \nproblem occurrs due to a defect in the product where the channel\nserver erroneously closes its open to Queue Server but assumes \nthat its open to Queue Server is valid. The open handle \nto Queue Server after it is closed, gets reused by another open\nand hence any subsequent communication by Channel Server to \nQueue Server always fails. Typically, this problem is seen when\nthe Channel Server experiences transient socket errors with the \nchannel agent (MCA) and it wants to close the socket connection.\nAfter closing the socket connection, Channel server sends a \nmessage to Execute Controller process to de-allocate the MCA\nwith which it had socket error with. It is during this \ncommunication between the Channel Server and the Execution\nController when the Channel Server erroneously closes the open\nto the Queue Server.\n\nAPAR IC69572 - Channel server abends due to illegal address reference during\nadopt MCA processing. This problem happens if the Queue Manager\nhas enabled adopt MCA processing to a remote WMQ Queue Manager\nthat does not send a remote queue manager name during channel\ninitialization/negotiation. The remote Queue Manager field\nremains NULL and during the Adopt MCA processing logic,\nthe channel server incorrectly references the NULL pointer and\nabends. \n\nAPAR IC69932 - SNA WMQ listener fails to start the channel when HP SPR \nT9055H07^AGN is present on the NonStop system. HP, in its SPR\nSPR T9055H07^AGN, changed the behavior of sendmsg() API if '-1'\nis used as a file descriptor to the API. This caused \nincompatibility with WMQ SNA listener process. WMQ code has now \nbeen revised to work with the updated sendmsg() behavior. \n\nAPAR IC69996 - WMQ Queue Server generates FDC with reply error 74. When an\napplication with a waiting syncpoint MQGET suddenly dies \nbefore getting a reply, the Queue Server can cause FDC \nsometimes. This happens in a narrow timing window when a message\nbecomes available on the queue and the Queue Server starts \nprocessing the waiting MQGET request. If the application dies\nafter Queue Server starts processing the waiting MQGET request, \nthen Queue Server detects the inherited TMF transaction error \nand replies back with error 2072 (MQRC_SYNCPOINT_NOT_AVAILABLE).\nHowever in this case, Queue Server erroneously does not delete\nits internal waiter record for MQGET. When the timer pops for\nthe waiter record, Queue Server attempts to reply back with\nno message available but the call to Guardian REPLYX procedure\nfails with error 74 as the reply to the same request has already\nbeen made(with error MQRC_SYNCPOINT_NOT_AVAILABLE). This causes\nthe Queue Server to FDC.\n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were\nalso released with V5.3.1.7:\n\n363 - WMQ Queue Server under certain conditions fails to handle non-persistent\nand persistent segmented messages at the same time.\n1317 - Support for parallel execution of multiple endmqm programs on the same\nQueue Manager. \n1404 - MQGET WAIT is not being rejected with error 2069 when there is an \nexisting MQGET set signal on the same queue handle. \n1434 - svcmqm utility fails when install files are open but does not tell the \nuser which files are open. \n1566 - svcmqm does not exit immediately when 'cp' command fails to copy \nbinaries during fixpack installation.\n1679 - WMQ Queue Server generates FDC while failing to open the message \noverflow file during retrieval of very large messages (equal to or \nlarger than 'Message Overflow Threshold' displayed with dspmqfls \nutility).\n1709 - instmqm changes related to the use of /opt directory for the creation of\nbackup archive file.\n1789 - Port of distributed APAR IY66826. Cluster sender channel does not start\nand Queue Manager cache status remain in STARTING state.\n1780 - Port of distributed APAR IY85542. RESET CLUSTER command does not remove \ndeleted repository entry.\n1993 - Enhancement to WMQ mqrc program to print messages related to errors \nbeing returned on NonStop platform.\n2018 - WMQ lqma agent process leaks catalog file open.\n2181 - svcmqm does not output the fixpack that is being installed.\n2282 - instmqm -b archives everything under /opt directory.\n2290 - Enhancement to Execution Controller process to aid development dubugging\nand troubleshooting.\n2534 - svcmqm has no log of its progress.\n2580 - Potential SEGV in internal function call during Pathway serverclass \nstarting.\n2632 - Incorrect message output in FDC generated by WMQ Queue Server during \nnsrReply function call.\n2633 - WMQ Command Server memory leak found in CLEAR QL command.\n2842 - WMQ Repman process priority was not set correctly when the \nqmproc.ini 'AllProcesses' stanza Priority attribute is configured. \n\nThe following serviceability fixes were made to the SDCP tool:\n\n1971 - sdcp data was not collected correctly when there is a default \nQueue Manager defined.\n2211 - sdcp testing of the permission of /tmp directory.\n2289 - sdcp logging of progress to a file to aid in sdcp problem diagnosis.\n2298 - sdcp performance improvement.\n2531 - sdcp logging of scheduled CPU information.\n2582 - sdcp capture of Pathway data for PATHMON, PATHWAY, TCP, PROGRAM\nand TERM attributes.\n\nThe following APAR fixes were released in V5.3.1.6:\n\nAPAR IC60204 - A Memory leak occurs with repeated DISPLAY NAMELIST command. The\nleak is observed only when the NAMELIST(s) has one or more NAMES\nvalues defined. The problem is observed from within the runmqsc\nDISPLAY NAMELIST command, or from the PCF/MQIA equivalent. Tools\nthat request NAMELIST data via the command server with PCF/MQIA\nrequests such as WMQ Explorer will cause the WMQ command server\nmemory to grow.\n\nAPAR IC61324 - An orphan MCA problem occurs when a connection request from WMQ\nLISTENER or CHANNEL SERVER process to an MCA process fails. WMQ\nExecution Controller (EC) process fails to recognize the\nsituation and does not re-use the MCA process for future agent\nallocation requests. Over a period of time, this problem can\ncause the queue manager to run out of MCA resources which may\nlead to a situation where no new channel can be started. The\nproblem is observed during heavy load conditions where the WMQ\nExecution Controller(EC) process hands over a selected MCA\nprocess to LISTENER/CHANNEL SERVER before the MCA process\nbecomes ready to accept connection requests.\n\nAPAR IC61551 - The use of cluster administrative command\nRESET CLUSTER ACTION(FORCEREMOVE), to forcibly remove a Queue\nManager out of the cluster can cause FDCs. The problem can cause\nmultiple FDCs and sometimes abend in WMQ REPMAN process in a\nslave role. Once the command has been issued and the error has\noccurred, the concerned Queue Manager must be restarted to\nrestore the clustering function to normal operation. The problem\noccurs because WMQ REPMAN process in a master role does not\ndistribute the RESET CLUSTER ACTION(FORCEREMOVE) command to the\nslave REPMAN processes correctly.\n\nAPAR IC61651 - When a NAMELIST object with one or more NAMES values is defined\nfor a Queue Manager and a dspmqfls command is issued to retrieve\nthe details of either all objects under the Queue Manager or\nthe specific NAMELIST object, FDCs are seen from the WMQ LQMA\nprocess. The problem exists for both unthreaded and\nmulti-threaded LQMA process. The problem occurs because WMQ LQMA\nprocess does not allocate sufficient memory for NAMES buffer\nduring dspmqfls processing.\n\nAPAR IC61660 - A PCF RESET QUEUE STATISTICS command causes the WMQ QUEUE SERVER\nprocess to FDC. The problem occurs during a timing window when\nthere is an outstanding unit of work on the queue and a\nRESET QUEUE STATISTICS command is processed and then the\noutstanding unit of work is backed out. RESET QUEUE STATISTICS\ncauses certain internal counters inside WMQ QUEUE SERVER to be\nreset to zero without taking into account the outstanding unit\nof work. If the outstanding work is later backed out for any\nreason, the already reset counters become negative which causes\nan internal consistency check to fail within the QUEUE SERVER\nprocess and the FDC is generated.\n\nAPAR IC61681 - WMQ QUEUE SERVER causes FDC during MQCLOSE processing on a\ncluster alias queue. The problem occurs during MQCLOSE\nprocessing of a cluster QALIAS object hosted by a different\nQUEUE SERVER than that hosts the target local queue. MQOPEN\nincorrectly failed to allocate an internal handle for the QALIAS\nobject if it was a cluster alias queue. This lead to the FDC\nduring MQCLOSE processing.\n\nAPAR IC61846 - When a START CHANNEL command is issued after WMQ trace is\nenabled, the SSL channel logs a Queue Manager error message and\nfails to start.\nThe problem exists only for a SSL channel, no such problem\nis found for regular (non-SSL) channel. The problem occurs\nbecause of an incorrect implementation of NULL terminated string\nto store SSL Cipher data.\n\nAPAR IC61920 - WMQ on NonStop reports an extra EMS message when the generation\nof an FFST is reported.\nThe intention behind the second EMS message was to report the\ncase when the open of the generated FFST file fails but the\ncheck to see the status of the opened FFST files was missing\nin the code.\n\nAPAR IC62341 - A Security error from the WMQ OAM server is not propagated\ncorrectly. It was reported as MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_NAME instead\nof MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED. When running the Java IVP (MQIVP) to NSK\nwith a non-mqm user specified as the MCAUSER in the SVRCONN\nchannel, and if the non-mqm group isn't given authorization,\nMQIVP fails to connect to the Queue Manager\nwith an authorization failure (MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED) but it is\nreported incorrectly as a MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_NAME error.\n\nAPAR IC62389 - A REFRESH CLUSTER command within a cluster with more than two\nrepositories causes the Repository Manager to fail. The problem\nis not common in normal cluster operation but is likely if\nextensive administrative changes are being made to the cluster\nthat includes a REFRESH CLUSTER command. Incorrect distribution\nof channel status information across multiple copies of the\nREPOSITORY MANAGER cache in different CPUs of the system lead to\nthe FDC.\n\nAPAR IC62391 - Sometimes cluster queues are not visible on CPUs hosting WMQ\nREPOSITORY MANAGER process in a slave role. This is a cluster\nqueue visibility problem across the CPUs. Any attempt to open\nthe cluster queue on CPUs that have the visibility problem\nresults in error MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_NAME or\nMQRC_CLUSTER_RESOLUTION_ERROR.\nThe problem does not occur on the CPU that hosts WMQ REPOSITORY\nMANAGER process in a master role.\n\nAPAR IC62449 - The WMQ QUEUE SERVER does not log storage related problems to\nthe Queue Manager log. Some of NSK storage related errors like\nerror 43 and error 45 are useful errors for which corrective\naction can be taken to restore normal operation.\nThe WMQ QUEUE SERVER now logs these errors to Queue Manager log.\n\nAPAR IC62480 - Port of IZ51686. Incorrect cache object linkage causes\nunexpected failures (AMQ9456) based on coincidental event\nsequences.\n\nAPAR IC62511 - Port of the following clustering-related APARs from other\nplatforms and versions:\nIZ14399 - Queue managers successfully rejoin a cluster when\nAPAR IY99051 is applied but have mismatching sequence\nnumbers for the cluster queue manager object and its\nassociated clusters.\nIZ21977 - MQRC_OBJECT_CHANGED(2041),\nAMQ9511 SYSTEM.CLUSTER.TRANSMIT.QUEUE,AMQ9448,\nRepository manager ends.\nIZ37511 - Generation of an FDC by the Repository Manager causes\nit to terminate.\nIZ14977 - Missing cluster information when Namelists are used\nto add and remove queue managers from multiple\nclusters at once.\nIZ36482 - Changes to CLUSRCVR shared using a Namelist not\npublished to all clusters.\nIZ10757 - Repository Manager process terminates with error\nRRCI_CLUS_NO_CLUSRCVR_DEFINED.\nIZ41187 - MQRC_CLUSTER_PUT_INHIBITED was returned when an out-\ndated object definition from the cluster repository\nwas referenced.\nIZ34125 - MQ fails to construct and send an availability message\nwhen REFRESH CLUSTER REPOS (YES) is issued on a queue\nmanager with more than 1 CLUSRCVR.\n96181 - Object changed problems with the Repository manager.\nIY97159 - Repository Manager process tries to access the cache\nwhile restoring the cache, resulting in a hang.\nIZ44552 - AMQ9430 message after REFRESH CLUSTER.\n135969 - Refresh bit not set when demoting QM to partial repository.\n\nAPAR IC62850 - The md.Priority of a message was not being set to the queue\nDEFPRTY when a no syncpoint MQPUT is performed using\nMQPRI_PRIORITY_AS_Q_DEF while there is a waiting MQGET.\nA syncpoint MQPUT with a waiting MQGET does not have this\nproblem.\n\nAPAR IC63081 - A WMQ application abends in the MQI library when attempting to\nenqueue messages to a Distribution LIST with one queue entry.\nAlso in certain circumstances, WMQ applications may receive\nincorrect status and reason code while using Distribution LISTS.\n\nAPAR IC63105 - A Memory leak occurs in the WMQ COMMAND SERVER with repeated\nDISPLAY QSTATUS command. The leak is observed only when\nTYPE HANDLE is used with the above command. The problem also\noccurs from within runmqsc DISPLAY QSTATUS command, or from the\nPCF/MQIA equivalent. Tools that request queue status data via\nWMQ COMMAND SERVER with PCF/MQIA requests such as WMQ Explorer\nwill cause the WMQ COMMAND SERVER memory to grow.\n\nAPAR IC63271 - When an MQ application delays in replying to the HP system OPEN\nmessage from the WMQ QUEUE SERVER and an MQ message arrives on\nqueue during this period, the MQ message did not get delivered\neven after the reply to the HP system OPEN message is made.\n\nAPAR IC63757 - In a standard bound application, a memory leak occurs in WMQ\nLQMA process during MQCONN/MQDISC processing. The problem occurs\nwith both unthreaded and multi-threaded LQMA process. If the\nLQMA agents are configured to have high use count\n(MaxAgentUse for unthreaded LQMA and MaxThreadedAgentUse for\nmulti-threaded LQMA) and WMQ Execution Controller process\nre-uses the same LQMA process to satisfy a application MQCONN\nrequest, then the heap memory of LQMA process grows even if\napplication calls MQDISC to disconnect from the\nQueue Manager.\n\nAPAR IC64297 - WMQ Queue Manager becomes non-responsive because the\nWMQ QUEUE SERVER does not clean up the internal queue manager\nobject opens. The QUEUE SERVER internal links for\nMQOPEN of the Queue Manager object were not\nbeing released during the MQCLOSE processing. This causes a\nbuildup of QUEUE SERVER memory as the application repeated\nMQOPEN of the queue manager object repeatedly. When either\na MQDISC occurred or the application process ended,\nthe QUEUE SERVER cleans up its internal lists for the process.\nThis resulted in a perceived QUEUE SERVER loop and\nnon-responsive WMQ as there were\nover 246,000 opens found of the Queue Manager object with a\nhigh mark of 548,000 within the QUEUE SERVER when a dump of the\nQueue Server was analyzed.\nMQOPEN of other MQ objects (qlocal, qalias, qremote etc.) do not\nhave this issue.\n\nAPAR IC64373 - The COBOL copybook now includes missing definitions for MQGET\nSET SIGNAL processing.\n\nAPAR IC64435 - An incorrect persistence attribute was being set for a\nnon-persistent message on XMIT queue. When MQPUT of a\nnon-persistent message is done using MQPER_PERSISTENCE_AS_Q_DEF\nattribute to a remote queue while the channel is idle, the MD\nMD data in transmit queue header contained\nMQPER_PERSISTENCE_AS_Q_DEF value of (2).\n\nAPAR IC64630 - It takes longer for unthreaded SSL sender channel to end when\ncommunication to the remote Queue Manager is lost. The problem\noccurs because the unthreaded MCA process running the SSL channel\nfails to timeout correctly causing the channel to end differently\nthan non-SSL channels. The problem is observed only with SSL\nchannels and no such problem is visible with regular SSL \nchannels. \n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work are\nalso released with V5.3.1.6:\n\n1096 - An MQGET BROWSE operation can return prematurely with no message\navailable as well as can cause a waited GET to hang indefinitely.\n1513 - amqrrmit erroneously reports multiple master REPMAN processes.\n1587 - Enhancements to Execution Controller log messages pertaining to\nThreshold and MaxAgent capacity situations. For unthreaded agents,\nthe \"max unthreaded agents reached\" message will now be logged when the\nMaxUnthreadedAgent is allocated to perform work. In previous releases,\nthe message was logged when the MaxUnthreadedAgent was added to the idle\npool, which actually left one agent still available for use.\nFor threaded agents, messages have been enhanced to display separate\nThreshold/Maximum messages for agents and threads. In previous releases,\n\"further connections refused\" was displayed when the MaxThreadedAgent\nwas started, which actually left MaximumThreads connections still\navailable for use. In this release \"further connections refused\" will be\ndisplayed when the MaximumThread is allocated for use.\nAlso in this release, messages will be logged when the number of agents\nor threads, after having exceeded the threshold or reached maximum,\nfall below the Maximum or threshold limit.\n1669 - ZCG_FFST does not report the error code for a TMF error.\n1675 - The Execution Controller now provides an API to mark MCAs that are no\nlonger used.\n1670 - Correction to missing component data in a FDC generated by the\nQueue Manager server(MQS-QMGRSVR00) process(amqqmsvr).\n1678 - Queue server abends due to uninitialized FFST inserts.\n1706 - dmpmqaut -m <qmgr> sometimes only reports the first QALIAS object and\nFDCs in kpiEnumerateObjectAuthority.\n1710 - The Execution Controller sometimes allocates an MCA that it has\npreviously asked to end\n1712 - Cluster queue manager STATUS and queue visibility problems in slave\nREPMAN.\n1734 - Fixes/Updates to MQ tracing mechanism.\n1735 - Subscription id distribution.\n1751 - Fixes/Updates to MQ tracing mechanism.\n1807 - Changes to improve service and debug capability of Execution Controller\nstarted processes.\n1873 - \"*\" subscriptions are generated incorrectly causing them to be ignored.\n1989 - Fix for channel server hanging problem while opening REPMAN process.\n2003 - LQMA now FDCs when a invalid message is received.\n\nThe following serviceability fixes were made to the SDCP tool:\n\n1659 - sdcp is not capturing the PSTATE of backup processes.\n1676 - sdcp takes too long.\n1690 - sdcp MQ utilities are not using the correct Queue Manager name if\nthe name is mangled because of non-alphabetic characters.\n1702 - sdcp doesn't collect all relevant Saveabend files.\n1705 - sdcp workaround to avoid APAR IC61651.\n1971 - sdcp now gives correct output for default Queue Manager.\n\nThe following APAR fixes were released in V5.3.1.5:\n\nAPAR IC55607 - FDC files can fail to be written, or written to the wrong file\nFDCs can be suppressed or overwritten when application processes\nraise FDCs under User IDs that are not members of the MQM group.\nIn addition, because FDC files are named with the CPU and PIN of\nthe generating process, and PIN is reused frequently on\nHP NonStop Server, FDCs from different processes can be appended\nto the same file.\n\nThe format of the file name for FDCs is:\nAMQcccpppp.s.FDC\n\nwhere ccc is the CPU number\npppp is the PIN\ns is the sequence number\n\nIn V5.3.1.4 and earlier releases, the sequence number was\nalways set to 0. This fix introduces the use of the sequence\nnumber field to ensure that FDCs from different processes are\nalways written to different files, and that FDCs can always be\nwritten. FDC files are created with file\npermissions \"rw-r----\" to prevent unauthorized access to the\nFDC data.\n\nAPAR IC57435 - Attempts to end a queue manager with either -t or -p following\na cpu failure in some cases did not work as a result of\ndamage to the WMQ OSS shared memory files. The shared memory\nmanagement code was revised to tolerate OSS shmem/shm files\ncontaining invalid data. Invalid data in these files is now\nignored and memory segment creation will continue normally.\n\nAPAR IC58165 - Triggered channels sometimes do not trigger when they should\nSome attributes of a local queue that determine if trigger\nmessages get generated are not kept up to date for long-running\napplications. The most critical attribute is the GET attribute\nthat controls whether MQGET operations are enabled for a queue\nor not. If the application opened the triggered queue while\nthe queue was GET(DISABLED), and the queue is subsequently\nmodified to be GET(ENABLED), triggering will not occur when it\nshould.\n\nAPAR IC58377 - Trace data is not written when PIDs are reused for processes\nrunning under different User IDs.\nTrace files are named according to the CPU and PIN of the process\nthat is being traced. On HP NonStop Server, since PINs are\nrapidly reused, it is likely that a process attempting to write\ntrace data will encounter an existing file written with the same\nCPU and PIN. The traced process will be unable to write data if\nthe original file was written (and therefore owned) by a\ndifferent User ID.\n\nThis fix introduces a sequence number into the trace file names\nto prevent trace file name collisions.\n\nThe format of trace file names will change from:\n\nAMQccppppp.TRC to AMQccppppp.s.TRC\n\nwhere s is a sequence number that will usually be 0.\nTrace files are now created with file permissions \"rw-r----\"\nto prevent unauthorized access to the trace data.\n\nAPAR IC58717 - The Queue Server backup process generates FDCs showing ProbeId\nQS123006 from qslHandleChpPBC when attempting to locate a browse\ncursor message, with the comment text of\n\"Error locating Last Message in Browse Cursor checkpoint in\nBackup\" or \"Error locating Last Logical Message in Browse Cursor\ncheckpoint in Backup\". The problem appears only when running a\nnumber of parallel browse / get applications for the same queue\nobject.\n\nAPAR IC58792 - strmqm fails to delete orphaned temporary dynamic queues if the\nassociated touch file is missing. This results in these queues\nremaining in the object catalog indefinitely, and FDC files\nbeing generated each time the queue manager is started,\nreflecting the fact that the queue could not be deleted. The\nhousekeeping function was modified to always silently remove\ntemporary dynamic queue objects from the catalog, whether or\nnot they are damaged. FDC files are no longer generated.\n\nAPAR IC58859 - wmqtrig script does not pass TMC with ENVRDATA correctly.\nIf ENVRDATA is part of the PROCESS definiton used by\nrunmqtrm to trigger applications the TMC is not delivered to\nthe application correctly. The problem does not occur with\nblank ENVRDATA. Additionally, ENVRDATA or USERDATA attributes\nthat contain volume names ($DATA for example) are not processed\ncorrectly by the wmqtrig script.\n\nAPAR IC58891 - Sender channels that were running in a CPU that failed are not\nrestarted in some circumstances. Sender channels that are not\nrestarted report \"AMQ9604: Channel <...> terminated\nunexpectedly\" in the queue manager error log, and the channel\nserver create FDCs with ProbeID RM487001, Component\n\"rriChannelTerminate\".\n\nAPAR IC58976 - A server channel without a specified CONNAME enters a STOPPED\nstate when the MCA process running the channel is forcibly\nstopped or ends following a CPU failure. The channel state\nshould be set to INACTIVE following this type of event. To\nrecover the situation the channel has to be manually restarted\nor stopped using MODE(INACTIVE).\n\nAPAR IC59024 - The copyright data in the COBOL COPYBOOK CMQGMOL file\nis incorrect.\n\nAPAR IC59126 - Context data is missing in COA message.\nWhen an MQPUT application sends a message with COA report\noption, the generated replied COA message does not contain\ncontext data eg. PutDate, PutTime, etc.\n\nAPAR IC59364 - Queue Server primary incorrectly commits an WMQ message in\ncertain cases where the backup process has failed to process\nan internal checkpoint message. This causes an inconsistency\nbetween the primary and backup processes when an MQGET is\nattempted on this message, resulting in FDCs with the comment\ntext \"Invalid Message Header context in Backup for Get\" from\nComponent \"qslHandleGetCkp\". The queue object is no longer\naccessible via MQGETs, but can be recovered by stopping the\nbackup process.\n\nAPAR IC59388 - V5.3 OAM Implementation contains migration logic which may be\ntriggered erroneously in some circumtances, removing authority\nrecords from the SYSTEM.AUTH.DATA.QUEUE. This change removes the\nmigration logic, since there are no previous versions of the\nOAM which require migration.\n\nAPAR IC59395 - Threaded LQMA actual usage is one larger than the configured\nmaximum use count in the qmproc.ini file. Unthreaded LQMAs\nand MCAs (both threaded and unthreaded) do not suffer from this\nproblem.\n\nAPAR IC59428 - In some circumstances where connecting applications terminate\nunexpectedly during the MQCONN processing, either by external\nforcible termination, or as a consequence of other failures that\n\nresult in termination, the resulting error can cause the LQMA\nprocess handling the application to terminate. This will\ncause collateral disconnections of all other applications using\nthe same LQMA, with the application experiencing either a 2009\n(connection broken) or 2295 (unexpected) error. The problem\nwindow occurs only during one section of the connect protocol\nand has been observed only on very busy systems with repeated\nmultiple forced terminations of applications.\n\nAPAR IC59742 - qmproc.ini file will fail validation if configured with both\nMinIdleAgents=0 and MaxIdleAgents=0.\n\nAPAR IC59743 - Queue Manager server expiration report generation is not fully\nconfigurable. The frequency with which the queue manager server\ngenerates expiration reports is configurable but the number of\nreports generated is not. This change introduces a new\nenvironment variable (MQQMSMAXMSGSEXPIRE), to allow\nconfiguration of the number of expiration reports generated\nat any one time. The parameter can be added to the WMQ\nPathway MQS-QMGRSVR00 serverclass:\nALTER MQS-QMGRSVR00, ENV MQQMSMAXMSGSEXPIRE=<1-99999>\nIf this value is not specified in the queue manager\nserverclass configuration, the value defaults to 100.\n\nAPAR IC59802 - Memory leak occurs with repeated DIS CHSTATUS SAVED command.\nA memory leak exists in the Channel Saved Status query. This\nleak is observed within either the runqmsc DISPLAY CHSTATUS\n\nSAVED command, or the PCF/MQIA equivalent. Tools that request\nsaved channel status data via the Command Server with PCF / MQIA\nrequests such as WMQ Explorer will cause the Command Server\nmemory to grow.\n\nAPAR IC60114 - WMQ processes or user application processes generate FDCs\nreferring to \"shmget\" following forcible termination of the\nprocess or failure of the CPU running it. This is a result of\nthe Guardian C-files (Cnxxxxxx) for a CPU becoming corrupt\nduring an update operation, rendering the file and associated\nshared memory segment unusable. C-file update operations are\nnow performed atomically to prevent this problem.\n\nAPAR IC60135 - Improve servicability of the \"endmqm -i\" command to prevent the\ncommand from waiting indefinitely for the queue manager to end.\nFollowing this change after a specified number of seconds, the\ncommand will complete with the message \"Queue Manager Running\"\nand return to the command line with exit status 5.\n\nAPAR IC60175 - Description is not available (security/integrity exposure)\n\nAPAR IC60361 - Memory leak occurs in SVRCONN channel MCAs which repeatedly open\nlocal queue objects.\n\nAPAR IC60455 - WMQ Broker restart may not work correctly.\nIf the WMQ Broker is restarted using strmqbrk/endmqbrk,\nsubsequent attempts to restart the broker may fail, and 2033\nerrors my arise when running the test broker samples and\nrecycling the broker processes.\n\nAPAR IC60119 - System Administration manual incorrectly states the default\nvalue of the TCP/IP Keepalive is \"ON\"\n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were\nreleased with V5.3.1.5:\n\n1403 Erroneous SVRCONN channel ended message.\nSVRConn channels should not generate \"Channel Ended\" messages in\nthe error log, but in some circumstances, threaded svrconn\nchannels do generate these messages.\n1451 Internal changes relating to trace and FDC files sequence numbers\n1453 Problem with MQCONN after restart of broker\n1516 strmqm fails with invalid ExecutablePath attribute (qmproc.ini)\n1560 Port of V51 MQSeries for Compaq NonStop Kernel APAR IC57981.\nBackup Queue Server runs out of memory processing non-persistent\nmessages in 27K range. \n1564 runmqlsr abends in nssclose after a previous 'socket' calls fails\n1570 Added Agent type to EC logged threshold and max agent messages.\n1576 Change ECA interface to V4\n1577 Queue Server message expiration deletion phase log message\n1583 Blank channel status entries can get created triggering\nchannels when AdoptMCA is enabled.\nUnder certain timing situations, when triggered channels are\nused and AdoptMCA is enabled for the queue manager, blank\nchannel status entries can be created with the JOBNAME\nreferencing the Channel Initiator (runmqchi), for example:\nAMQ8417: Display Channel Status details.\nCHANNEL() XMITQ()\nCONNAME() CURRENT\nCHLTYPE() STATUS(BINDING)\nMSGS() BATCHES()\nJOBNAME(5,333 $MQCHI OSS(318898190)) RQMNAME()\nThis problem does not cause any immediate functional problem,\nhowever the blank entries consume channel status table entries\nand therefore could prevent legitimate channel starts in the\nevent that the status table becomes full.\n1594 C++ unthreaded libraries use threaded semaphores\n1596 Improved cs error reporting\n1597 EC started processes sometimes not started in intended CPU\n1598 NSS Incorrect component identifiers used in some parts of zig\n1608 Queue status errors on failure of a no syncpoint persist message\nput or get\n1601 Tracing details to the EC to augment the Entry and Exit trace\ncalls\n1611 LQMA Queue manager attribute corruption\n1613 Enhanced LEC Failure Handling\n1615 The EC may allow the os to choose in which cpu a MCA will start\n1616 Channel server comp traps have potential performance impact.\n1621 MQCONN does not report valid reason code when agent pool is full\n1622 After a channel is started dis chs displays \"binding\" in some\ncircumstances when it should display \"running\"\n1623 Incorrect message when MCA allocation fails\n1626 Addition of Service information collection tool (SDCP)\n\nNew platform support was released in V5.3.1.4:\n\nFixpack V5.3.1.4 introduced support for the HP Integrity NonStop BladeSystem\nplatform, NB50000c. Use the H-Series (Integrity) package of WebSphere MQ\nfor execution on the BladeSystem. Please refer to the Hardware and Software\nRequirements section for details about the levels of the J-Series software\nrequired.\n\nThe following APAR fixes were released in V5.3.1.4:\n\nAPAR IC57020 - runmqtrm does not function correctly and produces errors in some\ncases.\nWhen a triggered application is a guardian script file\n(ie filecode 101). runmqtrm produces an \"illegal program\nfile format\" error. Triggering also does not work correctly\nfor COBOL or TAL applications.\n\nAPAR IC57231 - The execution controller starts repository processes at the\nsame priority as itself in some cases, and does not take\naccount of the values set in the qmproc.ini file.\n\nAPAR IC57420 - Repository manager restart following failure causes cluster\ncache corruption in some circumstances.\nIf a repository manager abends while a queue manager is under a\nheavy load of cluster-intensive operations, in some\ncircumstances the repository manager that is restarted can\ndamage the cluster cache in the CPU in which it\nis running. This can prevent further cluster operations in that\nCPU and cause WMQ processes to loop indefinitely. This release\nchanges the repository startup to prevent this from happening.\n\nAPAR IC57432 - OSS applications that attempt to perform MQI operations from\nforked processes encounter errors.\nIf an oss WMQ application forks a child process, that child\nprocess will encounter errors if it attempts to perform MQI\noperations. Some operations may succeed, but will result\nin the generation of FDC files.\n\nAPAR IC57488 - MQMC channel menu display display error after channel is\ndeleted.\nIf a channel is deleted while the channel menu in MQMC\nis displayed, refreshing the channel menu produces the\nerror: \"Unknown error received from server. Error number\nreturned is 1\" and will not correctly display the channel\nlist without restarting MQMC.\n\nAPAR IC57501 - unthreaded sender channels to remote destinations with\nsignificant network latency may fail to start with timeout\nerrors.\n\nAPAR IC57524 - Applications launched locally from remote nodes cannot access\nsome of the queue manager shared memory files due to default\nsecurity on those files.\n\nAPAR IC57627 - Handling of TMF outages to improve operational predictability.\nIf TMF disables the ability to begin new transactions\n(BEGINTRANS DISABLED), WMQ does not always react in a\npredictable or easily diagnosed manner, and applications can\nsuffer a variety of different symptoms. If TMF is stopped\nabruptly (STOP TMF, ABRUPT) queue managers can become unstable\nand require significant manual intervention to stop and restart.\nRefer to item 18 in \"Known Limitations, Problems and\nWorkarounds\" later in this README for more information.\n\nAPAR IC57712 - altmqfls --qsize with more than 100 messages on queue fails.\nWhen a altmqfls --qsize is performed with more the 100 MQ\nmessages in the queue the processing fails.\n\nAPAR IC57719 - FDCs from MQOPEN when an error exists in alias queue manager\nresolution path. If a queue resolution path includes a queue\nmanager alias, and the target of the alias does not exist,\nthis will produce an FDC, rather than just failing the\nMQOPEN as would be expected.\n\nAPAR IC57744 - CPU goes busy when stopping a threaded SSL receiver channel\nusing MODE(TERMINATE).\nIf a stop channel mode(terminate) is used to stop an SSL\nreceiver channel that is running in a threaded MCA, the CPU\nwhere the MCA is running in begin using large amounts of CPU\ntime (95% range). This is due to a problem in the threads\nlibrary.\n\nAPAR IC57876 - Very infrequently, messages put via threaded LQMAs can in some\ncircumstances contain erroneous CCSID information. This has\nbeen observed to cause conversion errors if the message is\ndestined for a channel that has the CONVERT(YES) set.\nUnthreaded LQMAs do not suffer from this problem.\n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were\nalso released with V5.3.1.4:\n\n993 - Due to the way that default file security was used, file security for\ncertain shared memory files used by the queue manager (SZ***) may\n\ninadvertently change in a way that prevents applications not in\nthe mqm group from issuing MQCONN. File permissions were rationalised\nin this release to reflect those used for other shared memory files.\n1458 - Resolve Channel command generates FFSTs.\nWhen resolving In-Doubt channels, FFSTs were generated by the Channel\nServer and the MCA. Although the channels were successfully resolved,\nthe In-Doubt status in a DIS CHS query was not correctly updated.\nWhen resolving In-Doubt channels using the COMMIT option the following\nerror message was displayed \"AMQ8101: WebSphere MQ error (7E0) has\noccurred.\"\n1493 - The validation of the qmproc.ini file does not report the error case\nwhere multiple ChannelsNameMatch entries are specified ChlRule1.\n1498 - Instmqm does not support installation of the product on\nIntegrity NonStop BladeSystem platforms.\n1507 - Some Execution controller messages were missing \"Action\" descriptions\nwhen reported in the error log.\n1517 - In the qmproc.ini file, the AppRule4-SubvolMatch argument was not\nworking\n1522 - Communications Component Function ids and probes are incorrect. This\nresulted in misleading or missing information in trace files generated\nfor support purposes.\n1546 - MQBACK operation incorrectly reports error during broker operations\n1549 - Channel Server doesn't shutdown after takeover.\nIf the Primary Channel Server process is prematurely ended, for\nexample by a CPU crash, the Backup Channel Server process becomes the\nnew Primary process. Subsequent attempts to use endmqm will hang\nbecause the new Primary Channel Server process will not end.\n\n\nThe following documentation APARs are addressed by the V5.3.1.4 readme:\n\nAPAR IC55404 - REFRESH QMGR PCF command is not documented in the Programmable\n\ncommand formats manual.\n\nAlso - please check the \"Limitations\" and \"Known Problems and Workarounds\"\nsections later on in this readme for updates.\n\nThe following APAR fixes were released in V5.3.1.3:\n\nAPAR IC54305 - The HP TNS (non-native) C compiler generates Warning 86 when\ncompiling MQI applications\nAPAR IC55501 - The altmqfls command does not return the correct completion\nstatus; it always returns success\nAPAR IC55719 - Non-native MQINQ binding does not deal with some null pointer\nparameters correctly\nAPAR IC55977 - Channel retry does not obey SHORTTMR interval accurately enough\nAPAR IC55990 - Trigger data changes not being acted upon if they were made\nwhile the queue was open, leading to incorrect triggering\nbehavior\nAPAR IC56277 - Command Server can loop with INQUIRE QS command with a single\nparameter\nAPAR IC56278 - A remote RUNMQSC DIS QS command always times out\nAPAR IC56309 - MCAs do not disconnect from some shared memory when ending,\nwhich causes a slow memory leak, and under some conditions an\nabend\nAPAR IC56458 - Channel Server loops after installing V5.3.1.2 due to corrupt\ndata on SYSTEM.CHANNEL.SYNCQ\nAPAR IC56493 - Cannot use \"qualified\" hometerm device names with V5.3.1.2\nAPAR IC56503 - Channel Server and MCA can deadlock after repeated STOP CHANNEL\nMODE(FORCE) or MODE(TERMINATE) commands\nAPAR IC56536 - Unthreaded responder channels don't de-register from the EC when\nan error occurs during or before channel negotiation. For\nexample, bad initial data will cause this.

The connection works as expected until you add SSL. Now you receive the following error message, and the FDC listed below. \n\nAMQ9660: SSL key repository: password stash file absent or unusable.\n\n\n\nCAUSE\nSSL configuration problem.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nOnce the client-server connection is setup to work without SSL, perform the following steps to make it SSL enabled.\n\nOn the server, using IBM Key Management utility: \n\n 1. Create a key database say key.kdb (if not already existing) under <instalpath>\\WebSphere MQ\\qmgrs\\qmgrname\\ssl by choosing the key database type as CMS. \n 2. Enter and confirm password and opt to stash the password to a file. \n 3. Create a new self signed certificate. Ensure that the Key Label exactly as follows: ibmwebspheremqxx for a queue manager (where xx is the qmgr name folded to lower case). \n 4. Extract the self signed certificate, cert.arm to a local folder. \n 5. Copy cert.arm to client machine to a temporary directory. \n 6. Alter the svrconn and clntconn channel definitions to add the SSL Cipherspec (example: NULL_MD5) and copy the client channel table file AMQCLCHL.TAB to the client machine.\n\n\n\nOn Client Side, using IBM Key Management utility:\n\n 1. Create a key database(kdb) file as mentioned above and stash the password. \n 2.

After defining the extensions in .brmx and .brdx files, you can use the Installation Manager to generate an SQL script that ensures that your existing data is kept while changes are made to the RTS database to reflect the model extension. \n\n 1. Before making any changes, make a backup of the RTS database. \n 2. Log into the Rule Team Server console, navigate to the Configure tab and click on the Installation Manager. \n 3. Select Step1: Configure Database.  1. Choose the option Generate a script that keeps my data. \n        For an existing RTS data source with an existing Rule Model, this option enables the generation of an SQL script that:  * Creates a temporary table \n         * Copies the existing data into the temporary table \n         * Deletes the old table (which reflects the existing Rule Model) \n         * Creates a new table which reflects the new Rule Model \n         * Copies the existing data into the new table from the temporary table\n        \n        \n     2. To select the extension files you want to use, choose the option Custom extensions (brmx/brdx) and specify the location of the model extension (.brmx) and data extension (.brdx) files. \n     3. Click Generate SQL. This generates the rule-team-server.sql script which performs the operations listed above. \n    \n    \n 4. At this point, you can either execute the SQL script from the RTS console, or you can execute it using an external SQL client. You might have to work with your DBA to grant privileges to modify the database tables, depending on how permissions are set up in your environment.  1. If you wish to execute the SQL script from the RTS console:  1. Select the option Execute the SQL script. \n         2. Click Apply to execute the SQL script and initialize the database. \n         3. Click Exit to exit the Installation Manager. The new extension should now have been applied to your existing data.\n        \n        \n     2. If you execute the SQL script from an external SQL client:  1.  Return to the Installation Manager in the RTS console after executing the SQL script externally \n         2. Select the option Custom extensions (brmx/brdx) and specify the location of the model extension (.brmx) and data extension (.brdx) files. \n         3. Click Upload Only. This notifies the Installation Manager that the SQL script has already been executed. \n         4. Click Apply \n         5. Click Exit to exit the Installation Manager. The new extension should now have been applied to your existing data.\n        \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n\nNote \n\nIf you wish to revert to the original rule model, and no changes have been made to the rules, restore the backup RTS database. \n\nTroubleshooting \n * If you are unable to explore the rules of the rule project, restart the RTS ear application and try again. \n * If the extension has not been applied, follow the steps above again. \n * If you still face problems, contact Support with the server and database logs.\n\n\n\nFor additional information, refer to \nWebSphere ILOG JRules BRMS V7.1 > WebSphere ILOG Rule Team Server online help > Configure: Manage your project configuration > Configuring your Rule Team Server installation > Configuring the database [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/rtsohelp/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/Rule_Team_Server/ps_Rule_Team_Server_OH215.html]  \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration IBM Operational Decision Manager Platform Independent 7.5 Enterprise", "document_id": "swg21462292"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Question: Refining of search results returned in the Search Center by clicking on content types eg: blogs and wikis does not return any reduced result set.

These files use the existing virtual SCSI adapter technology to perform a transfer of the data from client to server.\n\n\nUsing PowerSC Trusted Logging to Store Audit Trail Logs\nThe output from the audit subsystem in AIX is a good thing to use Trusted Logging for. If you wish to track user or system activity, storing it on a remote server is a secure way to keep the data. When a file is stored via PowerSC Trusted Logging, the data is sent one-way only. It can be written from the client, but cannot be read from it nor can it be deleted. Access to the file contents can only be from the VIO server itself.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nVIO server 2.2.1.0 minimum\nAIX 6100-07 or 7100-01 or higher on the client LPAR\n\n\nSoftware Installation\nOn the client system we need to install the PowerSC Virtual Log software and the PowerSC license, both from the PowerSC Standard Edition packages:\npowerscStd.vlog.rte\npowerscStd.license\n\n\nConfiguring the Virtual Log Repository\nBy default the VIO Server will be set up with a directory /var/vio/vlogs and is configured to store the logs there. This can be changed to suit the user by use of the chvlrepo command, if you have another directory or filesystem you wish to store them in. \n\n$ lsvlrepo\nStorage Pool State Path\nenabled /var/vio/vlogs\n\nIn this document we will stay with the default path. In this example we also will not be storing the logs in Shared Storage Pools, but that is possible if your environment uses them. There is a link in the reference section at the end of this document for more detail on using Trusted Logging with Shared Storage Pools.\n\n\nUsing a Virtual Log Filesystem\nConsidering log files from clients can take up a large amount of space, it's good practice to create a filesystem separate from the traditional rootvg filesystems to store them in. To create the filesystem you will need to escape out of the padmin environment, as there is no command in padmin to make a filesystem.\n\n$ oem_setup_env\n\nUse this with care, as use of commands in this environment can have detrimental effects on your PowerVM server.\n\nThe virtual logs are stored in subdirectories under the path /var/vio/vlogs, so that is a good place to connect our new filesystem. We'll start out with 2 GB of space.\n\nFirst make sure there is no existing data under /var/vio/vlogs. There is typically an empty directory /var/vio/vlogs/config but we'll move it away temporarily, then put it back into our new filesystem.\n\n# find /var/vio/vlogs\n/var/vio/vlogs\n/var/vio/vlogs/config\n\n# mv /var/vio/vlogs/config /tmp\n\n# mklv -y vloglv -t jfs2 -Ay rootvg 2G\nvloglv\n\n# crfs -d /dev/vloglv -v jfs2 -A y -p rw -m /var/vio/vlogs\nFile system created successfully.\n2096884 kilobytes total disk space.\nNew File System size is 4194304\n\n# mount /var/vio/vlogs\n# mv /tmp/config /var/vio/vlogs\n\nCheck it again:\n# find /var/vio/vlogs\n/var/vio/vlogs\n/var/vio/vlogs/config\n/var/vio/vlogs/lost+found\n\nChange the permissions of the filesystem mount point to be the same as the original directory:\n# chmod 775 /var/vio/vlogs\n\nAnd exit back to the padmin prompt:\n# exit\n\n\nSetting Up the Virtual Log on the VIO Server\nWe will use the mkvlog command to create the virtual log on the VIO server. Since we are attaching the log to a virtual SCSI adapter, we need to find the correct adapter to use, that is connected to our VIO client machine. For this example we'll use vhost18, which has mapped an existing logical volume to the client to use as a virtual SCSI disk:\n\n$ lsmap -vadapter vhost18\nSVSA Physloc Client Partition ID\n--------------- -------------------------------------------- ------------------\nvhost18 U9117.MMD.067A967-V1-C38 0x00000016\n\nVTD lpar19_rtvg1\nStatus Available\nLUN 0x8100000000000000\nBacking device lpar19_lv1\nPhysloc\nMirrored N/A\n\nThe easiest way to create the virtual log is to do it in one step using 3 pieces of information:\n* The LPAR name\n* The log name\n* The virtual SCSI adapter name\n\n$ mkvlog -name LOGNAME -client CLIENTNAME -vadapter ADAPTERNAME\n\nSo if I would like to create a log file called \"audit\" for LPAR named lpar19 using the above vhost adapter I'd run the command:\n\n$ mkvlog -name audit -client lpar19 -vadapter vhost18\nVirtual log 000000000000000063d9c32987b64131 created\nvtlog0 Available\n\nIf the LPAR is running you can skip the client name, mkvlog will find it for you, but I am specifying all three here.\n\nNow check our virtual SCSI adapter to see if the log is attached:\n\n$ lsmap -vadapter vhost18\nSVSA Physloc Client Partition ID\n--------------- -------------------------------------------- ------------------\nvhost18 U9117.MMD.067A967-V1-C38 0x00000016\n\nVTD lpar19_rtvg1\nStatus Available\nLUN 0x8100000000000000\nBacking device lpar19_lv1\nPhysloc\nMirrored N/A\n\nVTD vtlog0\nStatus Available\nLUN 0x8200000000000000\nBacking device vlog:000000000000000063d9c32987b64131\nPhysloc\nMirrored N/A\n\nWe can also list the vlogs that exist for this host:\n\n$ lsvlog -client lpar19\nClient Name Log Name UUID VTD\nlpar19 audit 000000000000000063d9c32987b64131 vhost18/vtlog0\n\nIf we want more information about the log add the '-detail' option:\n\n$ lsvlog -client lpar19 -detail\nClient Name: lpar19\n\nLog Name: audit\nUUID: 000000000000000063d9c32987b64131\nVirtual Target Device: vtlog0\nParent Adapter: vhost18\nVlog State: enabled\nDevice Status: available\nLogical Unit Address: 8200000000000000\nStorage Pool:\nLog Directory: /var/vio/vlogs/lpar19/audit/\nMaximum Log Files: 2\nMaximum Log File Size: 1048576\nMaximum State Files: 2\nMaximum State File Size: 1048576\n\n\nConfigure the Virtual Log on the Client\nOver on the client LPAR, since the log is just another device attached to the virtual SCSI adapter, we can use cfgmgr to probe for it and create the device:\n\n# cfgmgr\n# lsdev -t vlog\nvlog0 Available Virtual Log\n\nWe can also list the attributes of the log:\n\n# lsattr -El vlog0\nPCM Path Control Module False\nUUID 000000000000000063d9c32987b64131 Unique id for virtual log device False\nclient_name lpar19 Client Name False\ndevice_name vlaudit0 Device Name False\nlog_name audit Log Name False\nmax_log_size 2097152 Maximum Size of Log Data File False\nmax_state_size 2097152 Maximum Size of Log State File False\npvid none Physical Volume Identifier False\n\nNotice there are two device names for the log: vlog0 and one using the log name back on the VIO server: vlaudit0\n\ncrw------- 1 root system 37, 0 Jul 29 09:58 /dev/vlaudit0\ncrw------- 1 root system 37, 0 Jul 29 09:58 /dev/vlog0\n\nWe can use either one for our output.\n\n\nConfigure Auditing to Use the Log\nIn our case we are using bin auditing, since that will store the audit records in binary form with a great amount of detail. We can use commands like auditpr or auditselect on them if we need to search for information and print it.\n\nIn the /etc/security/audit/config file, make sure bin auditing is set to run and use the special \"virtual_log\" device:\n\nstart:\nbinmode = on\nstreammode = off\n\nbin:\ntrail = /audit/trail\nbin1 = /audit/bin1\nbin2 = /audit/bin2\nbinsize = 10240\ncmds = /etc/security/audit/bincmds\nfreespace = 65536\nbackuppath = /audit\nbackupsize = 0\nbincompact = off\nvirtual_log = /dev/vlaudit0\n\nNow start auditing:\n# audit shutdown\n# audit start\n\n\nVerifying the Log Data\nWe can go over to the VIO server and verify that the log contains good audit data.\n\n$ oem_setup_env\n# cd /var/vio/vlogs/lpar19/audit\n\n# ls -l\ntotal 16\n-rw-r----- 1 root staff 2163 Jul 28 19:09 lpar19_audit.000\n-rw-r----- 1 root staff 650 Jul 28 19:09 lpar19_audit.state.000\n\nNow print some events from the log:\n\n# auditpr -v -i lpar19_audit.000\nevent login status time command wpar name\n--------------- -------- ----------- ------------------------ ------------------------------- -------------------------\nFS_Mkdir root FAIL Fri Jul 29 02:09:10 2016 java Global\nmode: 711 dir: /var/opt/tivoli/ep/runtime/agent/config.tmp/156357c41b5-43f5/change\n...\n\nSo it is logging properly.\n\n\nResources\nGetting started with PowerSC Trusted Logging:\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/POWER7/p7hb1/iphb1_getting_started_trusted_logging.htm [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/POWER7/p7hb1/iphb1_getting_started_trusted_logging.htm]\n\nConfiguring the virtual log repository\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/POWER7/p7hb1/iphb1_configure_vir_log.htm [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/POWER7/p7hb1/iphb1_configure_vir_log.htm]\n\nCreating a virtual log\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/POWER7/p7hb1/iphb1_create_vir_log.htm [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/POWER7/p7hb1/iphb1_create_vir_log.htm]\n\nVirtual log devices with shared storage pools\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/POWER7/p7hb1/iphb1_vir_log_dev_ssp.htm [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/POWER7/p7hb1/iphb1_vir_log_dev_ssp.htm]\n\n\n\nANSWER", "document_id": "isg3T1024049"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "\n\nI am observing the following errors on my DataPower 9235 device:\n\n[failure] Power supply '1' has no AC input power, or is not present.

But this configuration is needed to configure SSO with LDAP token.\n\nTasks overview\n\n\n 1. Prepare the LDAP server used as a user repository for user authentication. \n 2. \"Configure Embedded Application Server Login Settings\" from the administration console of OmniFind Enterprise Edition to point to the LDAP server you prepared. \n 3. When you install OmniFind Enterprise Edition with WebSphere Application Server(WAS) deployment, configure the global security from the administration console of WAS. \n\n\n\nHints and Tips for each tasks \n\n1. Prepare the LDAP server used as a user repository for user authentication. \n\n1. For a list of supported LDAP servers, refer to Requirements for OmniFind Enterprise Edition and OmniFind Starter Edition Version 9.1 in the related information below. \n\n2. Consult with your LDAP server administrator or confirm your requirement about which attribute should be used as login user name. ldapsearch tool is helpful to find that information. For further detail of ldapsearch tool, refer to Using ldapsearch to debug LDAP configuration problems in the related information. \n\n2. \"Configure Embedded Application Server Login Settings\" from the administration console of OmniFind Enteprise Edition \n\n1. When you configure the embedded application server login, select \"Enable login\" check box and \"LDAP server\" check box. \n\nYou need to specify following information. Consult with your LDAP server administrator for the correct entries: \n * LDAP server name \n * LDAP server port number \n * Base DN \n * (If required) Use credentials to access the LDAP server(LDAP User name and LDAP password)  * This information is used as bind user, and it depends on your LDAP server configuration.\n   \n   \n\n\n2. Select \"Search Administrator\" check box along with selecting \"LDAP Server\" check box. \n\nThis check box is useful when you troubleshoot this LDAP related configuration. (When this check box is selected, you can still login to OmniFind's administration console as enterprise search administrator even if LDAP server configuration is having a problem.) \n\n3. You need to edit ES_NODE_ROOT/master_config/esldap.xml file if you will use a login user name attribute other than uid. By default, login user name attribute is set as uid. \n\nFor example, if you want to use mail attribute as login user name, you need to change the following entry from uid to mail: \n\n<entry key=\"userIdAttribute\">uid</entry> \n\nWhen you edit the file, make sure that OmniFind is stopped with the esadmin system stopall command, and edit the file with utf-8 aware editor. \n\nFor further detail, refer to How do I configure OmniFind Enterprise Edition to use my email id for LDAP authentication on Jetty? in related information. \n\n4. Once you have finished the configuration, restart OmniFind with esadmin system stopall/startall command and test the following URL via browser on the search server: \n\nhttp:// <search server hostname> : <port:8394 by default> /ESSearchServer/snoop \n\nIf the user authentication related configuration is done properly, you will be challenged to input user name and password. Type the user name with the attribute that you set and password that is registered in the specified LDAP server and see that you can get the snoop page correctly. \n\n5. When you install OmniFind Enterprise Edition with default configuration, the search application is deployed on embedded application server(Jetty). \n\nAfter above steps are done, you can test if the user authentication configuration for the search application works. \n\nMake sure at least one collection's search is up and running from the administration console of OmniFind, then enter the following URL via browser: \n\nhttp:// <search server hostname> : <port:8393 by default> /search/ \n\nSee if the login prompt appears and you can login with the user name with the attribute that you set and the password. \n\n3. Configure the global security from the administration console of WebSphere Application Server \n\nWhen you install OmniFind Enterprise Edition with WebSphere Application Server(WAS), the search application itself is deployed on WAS. Thus you must configure the global security from WAS administration console. \n\n1. To enable the user authentication for the search application, select \"Enable application security\" check box, and configure the User account repository at the bottom of the page. \n\n2. If you use LDAP server for user authentication for the application, you might want to configure the Standalone LDAP repository or Federated repositories. \n\nDepending on your requirement, configure the LDAP server related information the same as when you configure the LDAP server configuration from the administration console of OmniFind. \n * primary host name (LDAP server) \n * port (port) \n * Distinguished name of a base entry that uniquely identifies this set of entries in the realm (Base DN) \n * (If required) Bind distinguished name (Use credentials to access to the LDAP server, LDAP User name) \n * (If required) Bind password (Use credentials to access to the LDAP server, LDAP password)\n\n\n3. Also, make sure that \"Login properties\" is set the same as userIdAttribute attribute in ES_NODE_ROOT/master_config/esldap.xml . If you changed the attribute from the steps above, you need to change the login properties as well. \n\n4. When you select the federated repositories as User account repository in WAS administration console, make sure that the user defined in each realm does not collide. \n\nFor example, suppose: \n\n1) You installed WebSphere Application Server with local wsadmin user \n2) You configure the LDAP server as a part of federated repositories \n\nIf wsadmin user does exist in LDAP server's realm, the collision occurs and the wsadmin user might not be able to login to the search application (or WAS administration console even if the user is specified as primary administrative user when enabling WAS administrative security). \n\nIf needed contact IBM support for further assistance. \n\n5. After the configuration is done, save the changes and restart WAS. Test if the user authentication configuration for the search application works. \n\nWhen you examine the login for the search application, make sure at least one collection's search is running and ready for search. \n\n6. When you configure WAS along with IBM HTTP Server(IHS)/HTTP Plug-in, you can examine the following URL via browser, \n\nhttp:// <search server hostname> : <port> /search/ (Access via IHS/HTTP Plug-in) \n\nand see if the login prompt appears. You can login with the user name with the attribute that you set and the password. \n\nNote that port number depends on your IHS and HTTP plug-in configuration. (By default, port 80 is configured for IHS and HTTP Plug-in is configured with WAS.) \n\n7. If you have problems with IHS and HTTP Plug-in, and you can not see the page with the URL in previous step, use the following URL via browser to access WAS directly: \n\nhttp:// <search server hostname> : <port:WC_defaulthost> /search/ (Access to WAS directly) \n\nSee if the login prompt appears and you can login with the user name with the attribute that you set and the password. \n\nNote that the port number depends on your WAS configuration. From WAS administration console, confirm which port number the WC_defaulthost property is pointing to. (You need to refer to ESSearchServer WAS server configuration (not server1) where the search application is deployed.) \n\nOnce you confirm this URL works, the problem could be HTTP Plug-in configuration. Troubleshoot further for HTTP Plug-in configuration, and contact IBM support if you need further assistance.

Prerequisites \n 2. What is the Match Database\u2019s purpose? \n 3. Setting the database up. \n 4. Configuring the Match Designer for use with the Database. \n 5. On going maintenance \n\n\nPrerequisites \nThe following must exist before using the Match Designer functionality.  1. Match Specification built for use in match designer. \n 2. Create a data set that contains the data you will run the match analysis on. \n 3. Create a corresponding frequency data set to be used in the match analysis. \n 4. DSN for local PC \n 5. Create Database in which to perform the Match analysis processing. \n    a) Sizing of Database \n    b) Character sets required \n    c) Permission's for users \n\n\nAdditional information is also available with in the WebSphere QualityStage User Guide. \n\nWhat it\u2019s the Match Database\u2019s purpose?  1. The results Database is used to test the match specifications (logic) designed for use in match jobs. \n 2. This functionality enables the user to get a baseline of how good the match criteria are, based on the match logic developed for use in the application. \n 3. The results Database stores statistics and match results based on your data. For Example: How many matches, duplicates, and unmatched records. \n 4. This functionality allows developers to change matching logic on the fly and retest within minutes. \n\n * There is nothing from this Database that is used in production runs so it should never be created on or moved to a production box. \n * The Match Designer is to be used for development purposes only with a \"subset\" of the full volume data. If additional match modifications are required continue to use a subset of data not conduct testing with full volume data. \n * Determining the subset size of data to use in the Match Designer will vary depending on the clients environment and resources. Each client should run several iterations to determine the optimal subset to utilize in the Match Designer step. \n * To obtain the most accurate matching thresholds a full volume run should be performed in the DataStage Designer.\n\n\nCreating the Database  1. You should start from an empty Database; using the default XMETA Database is not recommended because it can become corrupt. \n 2. There are certain requirements on how the Database is to be created. \n    a) If Oracle: CHARACTERSET should be set to AL32UTF \n    b) If SQL: default is fine. \n    c) If DB2: create as codepage UTF-8 and page size 32K \n    d) Permission\u2019s - Each user has to have the ability to create tables, write and read rights in the DB. \n    e) The minimum DB space required will be calculated as follows = Number of Passes in match specification (X) Number of Input Records (X) Input Record Length (+) 100 filler.\n    f) If this is a distributed installation, you need to have ODBC defined in your client and on the server. They must have the same name. \n\n\nConfiguring the Match Designer for use with the Database  1.  Via the DataStage Designer navigate to the your match specification to work with \n 2.  Double click and a window will appear indicating: \n     \u201cThe ODBC Data Source Name (xxxxxxx) currently specified for this Match could not be found. Please create a DSN by this name or run a Test Environment Update to configure a different DSN for this Specification.\u201d \n 3.  Select the \u201cOK\u201d button \n 4.  Select option \u201cConfigure Specification\u201d \n 5.  From drop down select \u201cTest Environment\u201d \n 6.  For \u201cSample Information\u201d navigate to the location of your data set(s) created for analysis. \n 7.  Under \u201cFrequency Information\u201d navigate to the location of your frequency data set(s) created for use. \n 8.  Section \u201cTest Results Database\u201d fill the following information in. \n     a. Select the DSN created for the will allow the connection to the Database. \n     b. Enter user name required \n     c. Password required \n     d. Test Connection \n     e. Configuration File Location; these are the nodes located in your environment for use. Please make sure this matches the location of where the data sets reside on the server. \n 9.  Once connection is established hit the \u201cUpdate\u201d button. This will populate the Database with the required fields (not data) to populate when you perform the test specification. \n 10. The final step is to perform the Test All Passes. Please note this make take a few moments depending on the size of the files used. \n\n\nOngoing Maintenance  1. For each new run, results are cleared and rewritten to the DB. \n 2. Each user should have their own respective Databases to avoid rewriting over previous results. \n 3. There are separate tables holding results for each design. And from one user it is no problem to use a single Database and multiple designs. \n 4. Per the recommendation above in \"Creating the Database\" this database should not be your XMETA database.

To set the HTTP Session time-out at the server level, navigate to Servers > Application Servers > Your Server > Web Container > Session Management. \n\nIn the Session time-out section of this window, you can select No time-out or Set time-out by clicking the appropriate radio button. If you choose to set the time-out, type the desired value in minutes in the box. \n\n\n2. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Enterprise Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Session Management. \n\nCheck Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the application session to overwrite those values set at the parent, which in this case is the Server level. \n\n\n3. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Web Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Web Module > Your Web App.war > Session Management. \n\nCheck Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the Application Session to overwrite those values set at the parent levels, which in this case is the Server or Enterprise Application level. \n\nAfter modifying these settings, save the master configuration. \n\nSetting HTTP Session time-out when application is packaged \n\nThe application developer can also select to set the HTTP Session time-out parameter when the application is packaged. This value is stored in the web.xml file for the Web application. \n\nThis setting overrides any session time-outs defined from the Administrative Console. Alter this setting by repackaging the application with a new value, or by modifying the web.xml file. The entry in the web.xml will be as follows: \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<session-config> \n      * \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<session-timeout>60</session-timeout>\n * \n * \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </session-config>\n\n \n\nWhere the \"session-timeout\" is an integer value for the desired session time-out in minutes. \nSetting HTTP Session time-out from the application code \n\nFinally, the HTTP Session time-out can be set in the application code. The programmer can invoke the setMaxInactiveInterval() method on HttpSession object to set the time-out value as desired. This setting overrides any time-out defined in the application package or made from the Administrative Console. \n\nHTTP Session time-out Override Precedence Summary \n\nThe list below shows the precedence from which the final HTTP Session time-out is derived. \n\n1.

The EventReader captures the event and then uses the highest captured StateChange value in its outgoing SQL to capture pertinent events.\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nPertinent events are not being processed. Looking in the EventReader log file the number of events being captured in each Read is 0. Testing the SQL being used in an nco_sql session produces a 0 result too. Testing the SQL again in an nco_sql session without the \"and StateChange >= 1234567890\" clause returns all the unprocessed rows.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nSomething has \"future dated\" the StateChange value of an event in the ObjectServer, the EventReader captured the event and, since the EventReader will use the highest StateChange value captured in the previous poll in the SQL of its next poll, this then future dated the value used in the EventReader. The EventReader will persist with this value (and will increment it by 1 every other poll) until such a time as it captures an event with a higher StateChange value.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe simplest solution is to manually reset the EventReader StateChange value via the GUI. Stop the EventReader, open it for edit, click the \"Clear State\" button, exit the editor and restart the EventReader.\n\nAn alternate solution is to perform this operation via the Command Line Interface:\n\n\n\n * telnet [Hostname] [Port]\n\n\nwhere [Hostname] is the resolvable hostname of the ImpactServer host and [Port] is the CLI port number (2000, by default). You will need to supply a suitable username (admin, for example) and password. Then at the READY prompt enter the series of commands: \n\n * Update Service set Running=false where Name='[EventReaderName]';\n * \n * Update Service set ClearState=true where Name='[EventReaderName]';\n * \n * Update Service set Running=true where Name='[EventReaderName]';\n\n\nwhere [EventReaderName] is the name of the EventReader that requires this restart process. \n\nIn cases where the likelihood of StateChange being inappropriately incremented in this fashion is quite high, one might wish to automate this process and have a Policy hunt for such occurrences. Please find following an example of a \"hunter\" Policy to capture any reoccurrence of this issue: \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * ANN=\"AcquireStateChange\"; \n   Log(2,ID+ANN); \n   Script=\"/opt/IBM/netcool/impact/bin/CheckState.sh\"; \n   Parameter=\"password\"; \n   JRExecAction(Script, Parameter, false, 30); \n   NumExecOutput=Length(ExecOutput); \n   Log(3,ID+ANN+\": NumExecOutput: \"+NumExecOutput); \n   \n   If(NumExecOutput >= 1) \n   {  * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * Log(ID+ANN+\": CurrentStateChange: \"+HumanStateChange+\" is greater than CurrentTime: \"+HumanCurrentTime); \n      Log(ID+ANN+\": !!!

If it finds any it then acquires the StateChange value from the .state file via JRExecServer using the example script referred to in the above example Policy as CheckState.sh: \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n\n\nIf the Policy finds the string it extracts the StateChange value and compares it against the current time and, if StateChange exceeds the current time, it undertakes the stop, clear and restart of the EventReader to bring StateChange back into line. \n\nThis examples a simple script to use the Command Line Interface to stop the EventReader, clear the StateChange value and restart the EventReader and is referred to in the above exampled Policy as ClearState.sh: \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n\n\nPlease note that the ClearState.sh script should not contain any spaces or special characters otherwise calling EOF will throw errors. Also, in latter versions of Impact, the username and password should be those of the tipadmin. Additionally, rather than have the password sitting clear case in a script one can pass it as a JRExecAction Parameter from the Policy - still clear case but the relevance of the variable can be made less obvious. \n\nBoth of these scripts are called by the JRExecAction() function in the example Policy and this in turn requires the JRExecServer to be running on the ImpactServer host(s *). \n\n* - The JRExecServer will be used by the current Primary ImpactServer only, as all EventReaders and PolicyActivators are run on the current Primary only but, if and when failover occurs and the Secondary ImpactServer becomes Primary, this new Primary will require access to a running, local JRExecServer. So, JRExecServer has to be running on both Primary and Secondary ImpactServer hosts to ensure availability in case of failover.

This feature can be configured in DataPower as it uses client connection with queue manager SVRCONN channel. \nThe default setting of sharing conversations (SHARECNV) value is zero in DataPower mq-qm object. The same default value for MQ SVRCONN channel is 10. The sharing conversations value is \nnegotiated between MQ server and DataPower and the lower value takes effect. However, in current versions of the DataPower firmware, the sharing conversations setting of 1 is treated as 0 when negotiating with MQ server.\n\nThere are three use cases to configure Sharing Conversations in DataPower mq-qm object: \n\nCase #1 : The negotiated sharing conversations value is 0 - The channel runs in a mode similar to WebSphere MQ V6 and does not uses features such as\n\n\u00b7 Administrator stop-quiesce\n\u00b7 Heartbeating \n\u00b7 Read ahead \n\u00b7 Client asynchronous consume\n\nSet a value of 0 or 1 on the Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower to disable sharing conversations regardless of the IBM WebSphere MQ SVRCONN setting.\n\nCase #2: The negotiated sharing conversations value is 1 - The channel supports IBM WebSphere MQ V7 and later release features as outlined in case #1, but each TCP/IP channel instance has a single conversation.\n\nSet a value of 1 on the Sharing Conversations attribute and select \"on\" in Share Single Conversation attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower as shown in the following picture and a value of 1 on IBM WebSphere MQ SVRCONN setting.\n\nThe Share Single Conversation attribute is only visible when \"Sharing Conversations\" is configured with value of \"1\" and then <RETURN> key is entered. For values greater than 1, the \"Share Single Conversation\" attribute is hidden in the mq-qm object.\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21647231&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21647231&aid=1] \n\nCase #3: The negotiated sharing conversations value is 2 or more - The channel supports IBM WebSphere MQ 7 and later release features and each TCP/IP channel instance supports 2 or more conversations.\n\nSet a value of 2 or more on the Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower and on the MQ SVRCONN channel.\n\nOn average, processing of messages from client applications is 15 percent slower when using SHARECNV(10) as compared to SHARECNV(0). Please refer to Performance Implications of Sharing [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.0.1/com.ibm.mq.csqzaf.doc/mi12240_.htm]\nConversations on Client-connection Channels. [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.0.1/com.ibm.mq.csqzaf.doc/mi12240_.htm].\n\nSince DataPower uses a connection pool in processing MQ messages, there are no additional benefits of using sharing conversations with the mq-qm object. However, in situations when mixed message sizes are used by the same mq-qm object, using case #2 will benefit mq-qm object as it will use new buffer management feature of IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7 when making MQGET API call.\n\nWhen using a negotiated shared conversations value of 0 as in case #1, mq-qm object uses maximum message size as the buffer pool for the MQGET API call. However, when mixed message sizes are processed by the same MQ Front Side Handler (FSH), it requests buffer pool based on maximum message size configured in the mq-qm object. The use of fixed buffer pool for small and large messages can deplete MQ server's allocated buffer and contribute to unexpected termination of MQ SVRCONN channel instance and may terminate the queue manager. In such a situation, using a negotiated sharing conversations value of 1 as in case #2 will benefit DataPower mq-qm object as it will use IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7 Read Ahead feature and the new buffer management feature for MQGET API call. IBM WebSphere MQ V8 release provides enhanced performance for case #2, when the negotiated sharing conversations value is 1.\n\nFor DataPower firmware releases 7.0.0.x, 7.1.0.x, 7.2.0.x and earlier, one should follow case #1 and use a negotiated sharing conversations value of 0. If you configure these firmware versions with case #2 or case #3, DataPower device may reload or hang due to connection instability and generate many MQ errors with Reason Code - 2009 and 2059. \n\nCases #2 and #3 can be used in firmware releases 7.5.0.x, 7.5.1.x and later. We suggest to use a value of 10 or less in Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object and verify the configuration empirically to make sure that IBM WebSphere MQ server can sustain load from DataPower with the negotiated Sharing Conversations of 10.\n\nNote: In order to use sharing conversations, make sure you have applied APAR IV24821 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV24821] (\"Client C application process hangs after cancelling thread\") to the IBM WebSphere MQ server. IV24821 is included in IBM WebSphere MQ V7.0.1.10 and later, IBM WebSphere MQ V7.1.0.3 and later, IBM WebSphere MQ V7.5.0.1 and later, and IBM WebSphere MQ V8.\n\nIn order to identify the negotiated Sharing Conversations status, the following MQ commands are used in the distributed platform.\n\nrunmqsc <qmgr>\ndisplay chs(CHANNEL3) maxshcnv curshcnv\n\ndisplay chs(CHANNEL3) maxshcnv curshcnv\n1 : display chs(CHANNEL3) maxshcnv curshcnv\nAMQ8417: Display Channel Status details.\nCHANNEL(CHANNEL3) CHLTYPE(SVRCONN)\nCONNAME(9.x1.x2.x3) CURRENT\nSTATUS(RUNNING) SUBSTATE(RECEIVE)\nCURSHCNV(1) MAXSHCNV(1) <---- Negotiated Sharing Conversations value of 1\nAMQ8417: Display Channel Status details.\nCHANNEL(CHANNEL3) CHLTYPE(SVRCONN)\nCONNAME(9.y1.y2.y31) CURR", "document_id": "swg21647231"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Why would CIUSNTSR stored procedure creation fail with message DSNT408I and SQLCODE=-401?

Is it possible to do so without using the SOAP port? \n\nANSWER\nTo get a list of deployed RuleApps from Rule Execution Server using API, you can use the sample WebSphere ILOG JRules BRMS V7.1 > Samples > Rule Execution Server samples > Automated ruleset management sample. [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Global1756.html]\nThe method displayResContent in JmxRemoteImpl.java uses JMX to list the ruleapps currently deployed on RES. \n\nHowever, this sample requires the use of the SOAP port. If your environment does not allow the use of the SOAP port, you can choose one of the following options:\n\n1. Use a Web application or servlet to retrieve ruleapps from RES\n\nSet up a web application or a servlet to retrieve the ruleapps from RES. Invoke the servlet using an HTTP port. This solution mirrors how the RES ant tasks retrieve the list of ruleapps from RES. They communicate through HTTP to a servlet which uses JMX to retrieve the information from RES. \n\nThe RuleAppController.java class of the j2eerulesession [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Global1754.html] sample shows how to access the ruleapps repository from the management session. Specifically, you can use the following API to get the list of ruleapps on RES:\n\nIlrSessionFactory sessionFactory = new IlrPOJOSessionFactory(); \nIlrManagementSession managementSession = sessionFactory.createManagementSession(); \n\nIlrRepositoryFactory repositoryFactory = managementSession.getRepositoryFactory(); \nIlrMutableRepository repository = repositoryFactory.createRepository(); \nfor (Iterator ruleAppIter = repository.getRuleApps().iterator();ruleAppIter.hasNext();){ \npw.println(ruleAppIter.next()); \n} \n\n\nIn the j2eerulession [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Global1754.html] sample, the webapp authenticates the session using resAdmin/resAdmin as the username/password combination. Your application would have to be similarly authenticated before making the calls above. You could use \"run-as\" security identity for the servlet (set to resAdministrators role) in the web.xml to help with security issues. This way when the servlet is executed, it automatically runs as a RES admin , and you can put some security around that custom servlet if needed. \n\nYou should package the web application with the required jars as detailed in the documentation at \nWebSphere ILOG JRules BRMS V7.1 > Rule Execution Server > Deploying rulesets > Managing RuleApps using the MBeans accessor API [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Global993.html]\n\nYou might see the following exception when invoking this servlet:\n\nRegister MBean failed with type \"IlrJMXRuleApp\", properties \"{Name=ShippingChargeRuleApp, Version=1.0}\", and for the object ilog.rules.res.model.mbean.websphere.IlrJMXRuleApp@30693069.\ncom.ibm.websphere.management.exception.AdminException: ADMN0005E: The service is unable to activate MBean: type IlrJMXRuleApp, collaborator ilog.rules.res.model.mbean.websphere.IlrJMXRuleApp@30693069, configuration ID ilog.rules.res.model.mbean.websphere.IlrJMXRuleApp, descriptor IlrJMXRuleApp.xml. \n\n\nTo get around this, you should add executionserver/lib/jrules-mbean-descriptors.jar to the JVM classpath of the application server. Please follow the instructions in the documentation under the section \nWebSphere ILOG JRules BRMS V7.1: Java EE add-ons > Installing on WebSphere Application Server > Installing Rule Execution Server > Installing Rule Execution Server on WebSphere Application Server V7.0 > Deploying the Rule Execution Server MBeans descriptors on WebSphere V7.0 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.install.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules_Application_Servers/ps_Installing_JRules_IC47.html]\n\nThe following technote also addresses this issue, especially for versions earlier than JRules 7.1: \nRemote JMX interactions with RES MBeans deployed on WebSphere Application Server [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21423251]\n\n\n2. Invoke the ant task res-fetch-all\n\nAnother option is to use the ant task res-fetch-all [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Global1934.html]. You can invoke the ant script from your application, either as a new process , or programmatically as shown here: Invoking Apache Ant programmatically [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/0502_gawor/0502_gawor.html].\n\n3. Install a J2SE RES on the same database and retrieve ruleapps through API\n\nAlternatively in your remote process, you could use a J2SE RES instance configured to point to the same database as your J2EE RES installation. You would use the same management API (outlined above) to retrieve the ruleapps directly from the database instead of via the RES console.\n\n \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration IBM Operational Decision Manager Platform Independent 8.6, 8.5, 8.0, 7.5 Enterprise", "document_id": "swg21462316"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I got ODR OOM after upgrading the WAS to v8553.

In an environment that uses the ODR, the Memory Overload Protection feature of Intelligent Management calls System.gc() in an application server to check the current heap utilization. When this problem occurs, Memory Overload Protection calls System.gc() too frequently, resulting in high CPU usage and slow performance. \n\nCONTENT\nVersions affected: \n\nVersions 8.5.5.2 and 8.5.5.3 for Distributed Platforms and z/OS. The IBM i platform is not affected. \n\n \n\nProblem Description: \n\nWebSphere Application Server V8.5.5.2 and V8.5.5.3 include the fix for APAR PI08088. As a result of a change introduced by the fix for this APAR, users of the On Demand Router (ODR) in WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment V8.5.5.2 and V8.5.5.3 might see high CPU usage and slower performance on application servers caused by frequent System.gc() called from the Memory Overload Protection feature of Intelligent Management. This problem would not affect environments where the ODR is not used. \n\nWhen the \"Maximum percentage of the WebSphere Application Server maximum heap size to use\" setting for the Memory Overload Protection is set to the default value of 100, Memory Overload Protection is effectively disabled, but the problem still occurs. With the default value of 100, the System.gc() would be invoked every 5 seconds. With the setting to a value less than 100, the issue can be mitigated, and the System.gc() would be invoked every 5 minutes. \n\n \n\nSolutions: \n\nTo work around the problem without installing any fixes, the Memory Overload Protection feature and the System.gc() calls can be disabled by adding AutoMemoryOverloadProtection=false in the arfm.cfg file:\n1.

IBM Java (SDK / JDK) has been doing leap year testing/verification since 1996, including the non-leap year 2000 without a problem. Basically leap years in Java are explicitly supported by the GregorianCalendar class - that is it's function - and this class is tested with every release of Java as it is part of Java's core functionality. So any Java code which uses the GregorianCalendar class will behave correctly. \n\nWebSphere Application Server performs no specific leap year testing since it runs on top of the SDK which is compliant, and uses function from it. We are not aware of any issues in the past with WebSphere Application Server associated with leap year. \n\nFrom a JDK perspective, Java applications which use the GregorianCalendar class will be leap-year compliant - see the spec at: \n\n(Same info in the links for the various JDK's) \n\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/GregorianCalendar.html [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/GregorianCalendar.html] \n\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/GregorianCalendar.html [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/GregorianCalendar.html]\n\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/GregorianCalendar.html [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/GregorianCalendar.html] \n\n\nSpecifically: \n\n\"The only difference between the Gregorian and the Julian calendar is the leap year rule. The Julian calendar specifies leap years every four years, whereas the Gregorian calendar omits century years which are not divisible by 400.\" In other words the Gregorian Calendar follows modern leap years. The correct operation of the class is tested by the Java Compliance Kit (JCK) which is run against every release of the JVM. So Java applications would need to assert that they are using GregorianCalendars to claim leap-year compliance.", "document_id": "swg21578744"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "After applying update to AIX to bring it up to 7100-05-01-1731 which includes RSCT 3.2.3.0 I noticed that neither IBM.GblResRM nor IBM.RecoveryRM would stay operative in \"lssrc -g rsct_rm\" output.

Set the cluster scope (any node) \n\nexport CT_MANAGEMENT_SCOPE=2 \n\nThis must be set prior to running cluster commands. If you switch to another user, open a new shell or reload your environment in any way you must re-export this environmental variable. \n\n \n\n2. Optional - Enable manual mode (any node) \n\nsamctrl -M T \n\nThis will stop TSAMP from taking any action during the domain stop and startup. This setting/mode has no effect on RSCT or its operations. While manual mode is enabled (verify with lssam or lssamctrl) TSAMP will not stop nor start any resources so manual control of the highly available application is required. \n\n \n\n3. Change Critical Resource Protection (any node) \n\nchrsrc -c IBM.PeerNode CritRsrcProtMethod=5 \n\nWhen force stopping the domain the core RSCT daemons might exit abnormally, with the default setting of CritRsrcProtMethod this will lead to a kernel panic and reboot. Setting this variable to 5 prevents the kernel panic and reboot. \n\nVerify the change with \n\nlsrsrc -c IBM.PeerNode \n\n \n\n4. Force stop the domain (any node, check on all nodes) \n\nstoprpdomain -f <domain_name> \n\nThis will force stop the domain. Check all nodes in the domain to ensure that the domain has stopped on all nodes, use the following command on each node to verify that the domain shows offline: \n\nlsrpdomain \n\n \n\n5. Optional - Reset RSCT daemons (run on all nodes)\n/usr/sbin/rsct/bin/rmcctrl -z\n/usr/sbin/rsct/bin/rmcctrl -A\n/usr/sbin/rsct/bin/rmcctrl -p\n\nThese commands will stop and start the core RSCT daemons. For more information see the man page for rmcctrl. These commands must be performed on all nodes in the cluster to ensure that the problematic daemon is reset.\n\n\n6. Start the domain (any node)\nstartrpdomain <domain_name>\n\nOnce this command is issued monitor the output of lsrpdomain to see when the domain shows Online. When it shows Online from the node where startrpdomain was issued check the output of lsrpnode to ensure that all nodes also show online.\n\n7. Check lssam for problems (any node)\nlssam\nVerify that all resources appear as they were or that they are showing up properly (this depends on the reason why you are performing this procedure).\n\n\n8. Optional - Disable manual mode (any node)\nsamctrl -M F\nVerify with lssam or lssamctrl that manual mode is no longer enabled.\n\n\n9. Reset Critical Resource Protection back to normal (any node)\nchrsrc -c IBM.PeerNode CritRsrcProtMethod=3\nVerify that the chance took with:\nlsrsrc -c IBM.PeerNode", "document_id": "swg21686172"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What ITCAM for AD/WAS versions and maintenance levels support monitoring of WAS 8.5.5.x?\n", "id": "DEV_Q178", "answers": [{"answer_id": 31757571, "document_id": "swg21968507", "question_id": "DEV_Q178", "text": "", "answer_start": -1, "answer_end": 0, "answer_category": null}], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "CAMADALL CAMADWASDC maintenance upgrade interim fix TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n You want the latest maintenance of this agent, in order to monitor a mixed set of WebSphere Application Server instances, versions 7.x, 8.x and 8.5.x\n\nDo you need to (first) configure the GA version of the Data Collector on each of the WAS instances? Is there any best practice to follow? \n\nANSWER\nNo, you don't need to configure the base version v7.2. And, this is not the recommended approach. \n\nIf you plan to go for the latest maintenance, the best practice is to proceed as follows: \n\n 1. Download from Passport Advantage website the ITCAM Agent 7.2 for WAS, that is based on Data Collector version 7.2.0.0.1 \n 2. Install this agent by using the standard \u201cinstall.sh\u201d script (UNIX) or Setup executable (for Windows). Do not configure any Data Collector yet (you can exit the installer when it asks if you want to configure one or more application servers) \n 3. At this point, if you go to the ITCAM filesystem you should NOT find any ITCAM runtime sub-directory created yet, i.e./opt/IBM/ITM/dchome/7.2.0.0.1/runtime/... \n 4. From Fix Central website download all the needed maintenance files, for example for this agent you may want to take directly this one: 7.2.0.0-TIV-ITCAMAD_WS-IF0005 (it is based on Data Collector 7.2.0.0.10) \n 5. Install the maintenance as in step 2, but this time you can proceed to configure one or more WAS instances as needed.\n\n\nThe above is the suggested procedure in order to minimize any potential issue when trying to configure a WebSphere instance. An earlier version of the agent (such as v7.2 GA) could not fully support a specific setup, both at configuration time (limitation in the ITCAM configurator) and at runtime (limitation in the ITCAM Data Collector). Of course, a newer maintenance version will come with a newer ITCAM configurator and Data Collector. \n\nNOTE: The above steps assume that you have installed or updated all the needed Application Support files on the TEMS and TEPS servers of your ITM environment.", "document_id": "swg21968507"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I need to understand details regarding Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in OpenSSL affect WebSphere MQ 5.3 and MQ 8 for HPE NonStop Server (CVE-2017-3735).

Since the socketWrite() method is a blocking call, it will only complete when the remote side completely reads the data from the incoming buffer. If for any reason the receiving side fails to read the data from the socket, the sending socketWrite thread can hang. In many cases, the problem is not confined to a single thread, but usually affects many/all of the ORB threads trying to write data to sockets. \nUsually only one thread is stuck in socketWrite, and due to the nature of threads sharing a single ORB connection, all other ORB threads (WebContainer threads included) will be blocked in a slightly different stack waiting for access to the same socket. The following shows each of these stack conditions: \n\nClient-side socketWrite stack example (SSL stack will include com.ibm.jsse2 calls): \n\n\n\n3XMTHREADINFO \"ORB.thread.pool : 1023\" (TID:0x30554760, sys_thread_t:0x57323028, state:R, native ID:0x14C33) prio=5 \nat java.net.SocketOutputStream.socketWrite0(Native Method) \nat java.net.SocketOutputStream.socketWrite(SocketOutputStream.java:103) \nat java.net.SocketOutputStream.write(SocketOutputStream.java:147) \nat com.ibm.rmi.util.buffer.SequentialByteBuffer.flushTo(SequentialByteBuffer.java:410) \nat com.ibm.rmi.util.buffer.SequentialByteBuffer.flushTo(SequentialByteBuffer.java:439) \nat com.ibm.rmi.iiop.IIOPOutputStream.writeTo(IIOPOutputStream.java:541) \nat com.ibm.rmi.iiop.Connection.write(Connection.java:2225) \nat com.ibm.rmi.iiop.Connection.send(Connection.java:2267) \nat com.ibm.rmi.iiop.ClientRequestImpl.invoke(ClientRequestImpl.java:338) \nat com.ibm.rmi.corba.ClientDelegate.invoke(ClientDelegate.java:424) \n\nClient-side stack waiting to get into socketWrite: \n\n3XMTHREADINFO \"ORB.thread.pool : 1011\" (TID:0x30543190, sys_thread_t:0x55E2E1A8, state:CW, native ID:0x14426) prio=5 \n4XESTACKTRACE at com.ibm.rmi.util.buffer.SequentialByteBuffer.flushTo(SequentialByteBuffer.java(Compiled Code)) \n4XESTACKTRACE at com.ibm.rmi.iiop.IIOPOutputStream.writeTo(IIOPOutputStream.java(Compiled Code)) \n4XESTACKTRACE at com.ibm.rmi.iiop.Connection.write(Compiled Code) \n4XESTACKTRACE at com.ibm.rmi.iiop.Connection.send(Connection.java(Compiled Code)) \n4XESTACKTRACE at com.ibm.rmi.iiop.ClientRequestImpl.invoke(ClientRequestImpl.java(Compiled Code)) \n4XESTACKTRACE at com.ibm.rmi.corba.ClientDelegate.invoke(ClientDelegate.java(Compiled Code)) \n\nHow to determine if a JVM is experiencing socketWrite issues: \n\n1. Check SystemOut.log for hung thread messages (WSVR0605W) which will show socketWrite stacks. \n\n2. Take a javacore/threaddump to examine ORB threads. \n\n\nPossible Causes: \n\n1. Network issues causing slow traffic or dropped packets. \n\n2. OOM on the receiving side which kills the receiving reader or worker thread (in the case of reading fragments). \n\n3. Server's ORB worker threads are all hung. This in turn causes its ReaderThreads to become hung waiting for an available worker thread, prohibiting the reading of the incoming request msg/fragments from the client. In this case, javacores are needed on the server to determine its threads' states and why they are hung. \n\n\nSolution: \n\nAs seen above, socketWrite hangs can occur for any number of reasons. Obviously addressing the root problem (network, OOM, etc) can help prevent socketWrite issues, but the best measure is a preventative one using a number of ORB properties. The main property to set is com.ibm.CORBA.SocketWriteTimeout. This property will cause the writing thread to timeout, at which point a com.ibm.rmi.iiop.IIOPOutputStream$SocketWriteTimeOutException will be thrown, and the request will fail. Normal retry logic applies where the ORB will retry once by default. \n\nProperty: com.ibm.CORBA.SocketWriteTimeout \nSettings:  *  Set in seconds \n *  Default: 0 \n *  Set on client and/or server. In most cases, the problem is experienced on the client. \n *  Recommended values. 2 options: \n\n1. Set to a smaller value such as 5 or 10 seconds \nIf a server is truly hung and not slow, this allows client threads to clean up quickly. This approach however could terminate requests which aren't actually hung in socketWrite but are just taking a longer time than normal (due to socket contention, network slowdown, CPU spike, extra-long server process time, etc). \n\n2. Set to a larger value such as 20 or 30 seconds \nThis is more forgiving of slow server response times, CPU spikes, etc. by not giving up too quickly on the socketWrites. \n\nNOTE: The ORB com.ibm.CORBA.RequestTimeout timer will not start until the request message is successfully written to the server (ie socketWrite completes). In light of that, the SocketWriteTimeout (SWTO) property can be set to any value irrespective of the ORB RequestTimeout value. \n\n\nAdditional properties that can be set: \n\nProperty: com.ibm.CORBA.FragmentSize \nSettings:  *  Default: 1024 \n *  Recommended values. 2 options: \n\n1. Set to 0 (no fragmentation). This means the sending thread can write the entire message once it obtains the socketWrite lock. \n\n2. Set to a larger fragmentSize, such as 10240, if the average message size is large (over 50k). This minimizes the number of times a particular thread has to obtain the socketWrite lock.  *  Set on all clients and/or servers. \n\n\n\nProperty: com.ibm.CORBA.ConnectionMultiplicity \nSettings:  *  Default: 1 \n *  Recommended values: 5 \u2013 10 \n\nThis property designates how many connections a client will have to a given server. Increasing this number gives the client more connections (and hence more sockets) to each server which sending threads can share, thereby reducing contention over a single socket. \n\nNOTE: Additional resources (more reader threads and sockets) will be required on both the client and server(s) so be cautious of setting too large a value.  *  Usually set on the client side (but can be set on a server). \n\n\n\nProperty: com.ibm.websphere.orb.threadPoolTimeout \nSettings:  *  Set in ms \n *  Default: 0 \n *  Recommended value: 10000 \n\nThis property governs how long a server ReaderThread will wait for an available WorkerThread to handle the new incoming request. If there are NO free WorkerThreads, the ReaderThread will wait indefinitely by default until a free WorkerThread becomes available, which can lead to deadlocks or hangs. Setting this property >0 allows any particular ReaderThread to timeout after a certain period of time, which then allows the sending client side thread stuck in socketWrite to be released. \n\nNOTE: Tuning this property is similar to SocketWriteTimeout in that there are 2 basic approaches: small or large timeout setting.  *  Set on the server \n\n\nExample of hung ReaderThread: \n\n3XMTHREADINFO \"RT=51:P=946784:O=0:WSTCPTransportConnection[addr=1.2.3.4,port=47847,local=35293]\" (TID:0x7000000000B21E0, sys_thread_t:0x11AF3D548, state:CW, native ID:0x27B3D) prio=5 \n4XESTACKTRACE at java.lang.Object.wait(Native Method) \n4XESTACKTRACE at java.lang.Object.wait(Object.java(Compiled Code)) \n4XESTACKTRACE at com.ibm.ws.util.BoundedBuffer.put(BoundedBuffer.java(Compiled Code)) \n4XESTACKTRACE at com.ibm.ws.util.ThreadPool.execute(ThreadPool.java(Compiled Code)) \n4XESTACKTRACE at com.ibm.ws.util.ThreadPool.execute(ThreadPool.java(Compiled Code)) \n4XESTACKTRACE at com.ibm.ejs.oa.pool.ThreadPool.startWorkerThread(ThreadPool.java(Compiled Code)) \n4XESTACKTRACE at com.ibm.rmi.iiop.Connection.processInput(Connection.java(Compiled Code)) \n4XESTACKTRACE at com.ibm.rmi.iiop.Connection.doReaderWorkOnce(Connection.java(Compiled Code)) \n4XESTACKTRACE at com.ibm.rmi.transport.ReaderThread.run(ReaderPoolImpl.java:137) \n\nAPARS needed: \n *  IX90076 \u2013 FIX TO INCORPORATE SOCKET_WRITE_TIMEOUT IN ORB [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IX90076] \n\nShipped in JDK60 SR10, and JDK626 and above \n *  IX90112 - NULLPOINTEREXCEPTION IN SOCKETWRITETIMER THREAD [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IX90112] \n\nShipped in JDK60 SR14, 626SR6, 70SR5 \nThe NPE is logged in SystemErr.log, so this can be checked to confirm issue with the SocketTimer thread. \n *  PM83349 - NullPointerException in SocketTimerThread due to improper initialization [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM83349] \n\nShipped in WAS 7.0.0.29, 8.0.0.7, 8.5.5.0 \n\nFor more information on threads stuck in socketWrite see: \nHung thread behavior with SocketWriteTimerThread [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21639223] \n[http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21639223]", "document_id": "swg22015464"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "We have a DataPower appliance with TLS security protocol enabled.

How to suppress such comments in the ruleset ?\nWhy is the documentation text of a decision table repeated for every rule (one per row) in the generated IRL ? \n\nANSWER\nThe documentation of a rule is meant to be part of the extraction process, and it is possible to access its value programmatically at runtime with the API IlrRule.getFormalComment() [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v7r5/topic/com.ibm.dserver.reference.studio/html/api/html/ilog/rules/engine/IlrRule.html]. Since each row of a decision table is converted to one IRL rule, in order for the documentation text of the decision table to be accessible at runtime with the API IlrRule.getFormalComment(), the comment is repeated in every IRL rule derived from the decision table. \n\nIf the documentation of the rule is not needed at runtime it is possible to suppress it in the generated IRL by implementing a custom IlrIRLCodeGenerator that overrides the method IlrIRLCodeGenerator.printDocumentation(String documentation) [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v7r5/topic/com.ibm.dserver.reference.studio/html/api/html/ilog/rules/brl/translation/codegen/IlrIRLCodeGenerator.html#printDocumentation(java.lang.String)] \n\n \n\nA sample Rule Designer plugin nodocirl_1.0.0.jar is provided below along with its source code: \n\n nodocirl_1.0.0.jar [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21605119&aid=2]nodocirl_1.0.0.jar [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21605119&aid=1]nodocirl-src.zip [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21605119&aid=4]nodocirl-src.zip [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21605119&aid=3] \n\nInstall the Sample in Rule Designer \n\nTo deploy in Rule Designer drop the plugin file nodocirl_1.0.0.jar in the dropins folder of the Eclipse installation in use ( for example C:\\IBM\\WODM80\\WODM\\dropins , or C:\\IBM\\WebSphereILOGJRules7114\\eclipse\\dropins ). Then restart Rule Designer and do a clean build of the rule projects. \n\nInstall the Sample in Decision Center \n\nThe same custom IlrIRLCodeGenerator code can be used in Decision Center. To deploy it, bundle the file nodocirl_1.0.0.jar in the jrules-teamserver-<APPSERVER>.ear/teamserver.war/WEB-INF/lib directory and add a file jrules-teamserver-<APPSERVER>.ear/teamserver.war/WEB-INF/classes/preferences.properties containing the line: \n\nwebui.codeGenerator.irl = nodocirl.NoDocIRLCodeGenerator \n\nThen redeploy the Decision Center application.

One option is for file uploads and other option is for file downloads. \n * A server-side configuration option is introduced, which allows you to specify an optional white-list of MIME types. MIME types that are included in the list are allowed for uploads, but all other MIME types are blocked from uploads. \n * A server-side configuration option is introduced, which allows you to specify an optional black-list of MIME type mappings. Each MIME type mapping allows for a conversion to be made from a specific MIME type to a specific MIME type upon download.\n\n\nThe following example is a sample configuration of new options, which you can configure in the 100Custom.xml file: \n\n<server> \n<!-- mime type white list which specifies mime types accepted for --> \n<!-- upload to document list or document attachment --> \n<document-attachment-accepted-mime-types> \n<!-- specifies whether to allow a null mime type for upload --> \n<allow-null-mime-type>false</allow-null-mime-type> \n<!-- lists the mime types allowed for upload --> \n<mime-type>text/plain</mime-type> \n<mime-type>img/png</mime-type> \n</document-attachment-accepted-mime-types> \n\n<!-- mime type black list which specifies mappings from unacceptable --> \n<!-- mime types to acceptable mime types for download from --> \n<!-- document list or document attachment --> \n<document-attachment-download-mime-types> \n<!-- will map text/html mime type to text/plain mime type --> \n<mime-type-map> \n<from>text/html</from> \n<to>text/plain</to> \n</mime-type-map> \n<!-- missing <to> element implies mapping to content/octet-stream --> \n<mime-type-map> \n<from>application/pdf</from> \n</mime-type-map> \n</document-attachment-download-mime-types> \n</server> \n\nNote: The default configuration, which does not include the configuration information that is provided in the 100Custom.xml file, acts as a blacklist for the text/html MIME type and maps it to the text/plain MIME type. Providing a configuration in the 100Custom.xml file overrides the default configuration. As a result, for text/html to remain on the blacklist, it should be explicitly added to the 100Custom.xml file.

Eclipse changed the window system requirement from motif to gtk on UNIX operating systems. For AIX, this Eclipse window system change requires the gtk libraries to be installed to support the GUI. For Installation Manager, the GUI is the wizard mode of operation. \n\nYou can use Installation Manager without the gtk libraries. For information on console mode, command-line mode, or silent mode; see the Installation Manager Information Center [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1r6/topic/com.ibm.cic.agent.ui.doc/topics/c_modes.html]. Silent mode uses a response file and command-line mode is supported by all packages. For console mode, check your product documentation to verify that the product supports console mode.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nTo use the GUI, the gtk+ RPM and dependencies must be available on AIX. \n\n\nInstall this set of RPMs on AIX:\n\n\natk-1.12.3-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\ncairo-1.8.8-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nexpat-2.0.1-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nfontconfig-2.4.2-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nfreetype2-2.3.9-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\ngettext-0.10.40-6.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\nglib2-2.12.4-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\ngtk2-2.10.6-4.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nlibjpeg-6b-6.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\nlibpng-1.2.32-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nlibtiff-3.8.2-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\npango-1.14.5-4.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\npixman-0.12.0-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nxcursor-1.1.7-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nxft-2.1.6-5.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\nxrender-0.9.1-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nzlib-1.2.3-3.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\n\nThe installed RPMs must be of the minimum versions listed above.\n\nTo install the RPM versions specified above take the following steps: \n\n\n 1. Download the gtk2_bundle_v2.tar package [ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/aix/freeSoftware/aixtoolbox/ezinstall/ppc/] (version 'v2') containing all the RPMs and the install script to a new directory. \n    \n    \n 2. Decompress the tar file. \n    You can use the command tar -xvf gtk2_bundle_<version>.tar to decompress the file.\n    \n    \n 3. Open the decompressed directory gtk2_bundle_<version> and run the install.sh script.\n    \n    The script will check if the required RPMs are installed at the compatible level. If they are not, the script will prompt to install the compatible versions.\n    \n    \n 4. Verify the environment variable LIBPATH contains a path to the installed libraries. \n    For example LIBPATH=/opt/freeware/lib/\n\n\nNote that if you download and install RPMs individually, we have found that the following libraries are incompatible:  * glib2-2.14.6-2 and gtk2-2.10.6-5 \n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n#Unreadable characters in the GUI when using X11 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21661861]", "document_id": "swg21631478"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Why WebSphere Application Server transactions are rolled back with these StaleConnectionExceptions?\nMy transactions are rolled back and the following errors are seen in the WebSphere Application Server logs:\n\nConnectionEve A J2CA0056I: ........ ........

The log files are then filled with hanging threads and the server begins consuming 100% of CPU resources, which causes the server to becomes non-responsive. You must stop and restart the server. \n\nAn example of this issue is when you use the Microsoft SQL Server JDBC Driver 2.0 while Java\u2122 database connectivity (JDBC) Driver 3.0 is currently available and recommended for use.\n\n\nCAUSE\nExamine the log files and look for DSRAxxxxE exceptions that point to features that are not implemented. With an incorrect level of the JDBC driver, some features might not be supported, which can cause resource issues.\n\nWhen a connection error occurs, the connection pool manager tries to destroy the connection. This process involves cleaning up JDBC objects that are associated with the connection and a call to JDBC driver. If the JDBC driver is at an incorrect version level, some missing features might cause socket write exceptions, DSRAxxxE exceptions, hangs, high CPU, and so on. \n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nYou might see messages that are similar to the following text: \n\n\n[9/23/11 18:21:33:179 CDT] 00000012 ConnectionEve A J2CA0056I: The Connection Manager received a fatal connection error from the Resource Adapter for resource\n\njdbc/com.ibm.ws.sib/esbnode.server1-CEI.esbcell.BUS.

That is, objectA that references objectB that itslef references objectA in the Excel scenario file cannot be processed by the scenario provider. This is because the data objects are created one after the other in the Excel scenario provider algorithm.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe recommended solution for handling cross reference in DVS is to associate one object to another implicitly in a custom constructor, instead of handling both references from the Excel scenario sheet. \n\nThe custom constructor can be defined in the BOM as a virtual constructor with b2x implementation so that the XOM can remain unchanged. \n\nSample scenario:\nClass Customer and Class Order are cross referenced through attributes, Customer.order and Order.customer. \n\nSolution: \nStep 1. In Customer BOM class, enable \"ignore for DVS\" property on the attribute Customer.order. Step 2. Select the default constructor of the Customer class as \"DVS constructor\", which takes no parameter. \nStep 3. In Order BOM class, enable \"ignore for DVS\" property on the attribute Order.customer. Step 4. Create a virtual custom constructor in the Order BOM class that only takes a Customer object as a parameter. For instance, \n\n * public Order(Customer cus){ \n *  com.ilog.Order myOrder = new com.ilog.Order(); \n   cus.order = myOrder; \n   myOrder.customer = cus; \n   return myOrder; \n * } \n   \n * \n *  \n\nStep 5. Select the custom constructor defined in step 4 as \"DVS constructor\" for Order class. Step 6. Generate the Excel scenario template using Tabbed Format. \n\nAs a result, the generated scenario template will display Customer and Order tabs respectively. The Customer worksheet will NOT include the attribute, customer.order. The Order worksheet will include a reference to the name of an object defined in the Customer sheet. \n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration IBM Operational Decision Manager Features:BOM (Business Object Model) 8.5, 8.0, 7.5", "document_id": "swg21587674"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "While attempting to upgrade Portal to CF14 the upgrade fails during the import-nodes sub-task.\n\nThe ConfigTrace.log shows the following...\n\nimport-nodes:\n\n--- Exception Thrown --- C:\\Portal8\\PortalServer\\jcr\\wp.content.repository.install\\config\\include s\\jcr.install_cfg.xml:826: com.ibm.icm.jcr.task.TaskException: TASK001X: Remote task execution failed with response code 404 due to exception : Not Found .

Instead Microsoft provides a tool that you can download called Process Explorer [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653]. This tool identifies the open handles/files associated with the Java\u2122 process (but usually not sockets opened by the Winsock component) and determines which handles are still opened. These handles result in the \"Too many open files\" error message. \n\nTo display the handles, click on the Gear Icon [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&amp;aid=1] in the toolbar (or press CTRL+ H to toggle the handles view). The icon will change to the icon for DLL files (so you can toggle it back to the DLL view). \n\nIt is important that you change the Refresh Rate. Select View > Update Speed, and change it to 5 seconds. \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&aid=2] \n\nThere is also another Microsoft utility called Handle that you can download from the following URL: \nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896655.aspx [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896655.aspx] \n\nThis tool is a command line version of Process Explorer. The URL above contains the usage instructions. \n\n\nAIX \nThe commands lsof and procfiles are usually the best commands to determine what files and sockets are opened.. \n\nlsof \nTo determine if the number of open files is growing over a period of time, issue lsof to report the open files against a PID on a periodic basis. For example: \n\nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nThis output does not give the actual file names to which the handles are open. It provides only the name of the file system (directory) in which they are contained. The lsof command indicates if the open file is associated with an open socket or a file. When it references a file, it identifies the file system and the inode, not the file name. \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\nprocfiles \nThe procfiles command does provide similar information, and also displays the full filenames loaded. It may not show sockets in use. \n\nprocfiles -n [PID] > procfiles.out \n\n\nOther commands (to display filenames that are opened) \n\nINODES and DF \ndf -kP filesystem_from_lsof | awk '{print $6}' | tail -1 \n>> Note the filesystem name \nfind filesystem_name -inum inode_from_lsof -print > filelist.out \n>> Shows the actual file name \n\nsvmon \nsvmon -P PID -m | grep pers (for JFS) \nsvmon -P PID -m | grep clnt (for JFS2, NFS) \n(this opens files in the format: filesystem_device:inode) \n\nUse the same procedure as above for finding the actual file name. \n\n\nLinux To determine if the number of open files is growing over a period of time, issue lsof to report the open files against a PID on a periodic basis. For example: \n\nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nThe output will provide you with all of the open files for the specified PID. You will be able to determine which files are opened and which files are growing over time. \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\n\nAlternately you can list the contents of the file descriptors as a list of symbolic links in the following directory, where you replace PID with the process ID. This is especially useful if you don't have access to the lsof command: \n\nls -al /proc/PID/fd \n\n\nSolaris Run the following commands to monitor open file (socket) descriptors on Solaris: \n\npfiles \n/usr/proc/bin/pfiles [ PID ] > pfiles.out \n\nlsof \nlsof -p [ PID ] > lsof.ou t \n\nThis will get one round of lsof output. If you want to determine if the number of open files is growing over time, you can issue the command with the -r option to capture multiple intervals: \nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times", "document_id": "swg21067352"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "You want to know how to make persistent the events that indicate when a queue manager has started and stopped.", "id": "DEV_Q211", "answers": [{"answer_id": 42369165, "document_id": "swg27050154", "question_id": "DEV_Q211", "text": "First, a baseline scenario is described in which when using the defaults, there is only 1 record in the SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT queue, regardless of how many times you restart the queue manager.\n\n\nSecond, a modification is done to the SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT queue to indicate that the default persistence is enabled, and thus, subsequent events from the stop/start of the queue manager will be kept in the queue.\nalter ql(SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT) defpsist(YES)", "answer_start": 93, "answer_end": 554, "answer_category": null}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "ue SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT to audit the start and the stop for a MQ queue manager. \n\nCONTENT\nFirst, a baseline scenario is described in which when using the defaults, there is only 1 record in the SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT queue, regardless of how many times you restart the queue manager.\n\n\nSecond, a modification is done to the SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT queue to indicate that the default persistence is enabled, and thus, subsequent events from the stop/start of the queue manager will be kept in the queue.\nalter ql(SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT) defpsist(YES)\n\nCaveat:\nIf you want to have persistent messages in the SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT queue you will need to have discipline and a procedure to get and remove the messages, otherwise, the queue will eventually fill up.\n\n\n\nFile: How to make persistent the events for starting and stopping an MQ queue manager.pdf \n\nHow to make persistent the events for starting and stopping an MQ queue manager.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27050154&aid=2]How to make persistent the events for starting and stopping an MQ queue manager.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27050154&aid=1]\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration IBM MQ Capability AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, Windows 9.0, 8.0, 7.5", "document_id": "swg27050154"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "\n\nHi All,\n\n \nI have installed Datacap 9.0.1 and there is a issue of not connecting to Admin and engine DB with Datacap 9.0.1.\n \nThe problem is there for saving admin and engine db configurations.\n \nWhen selected the path it saves but after tab out and tab in it clears admin and engine DB configurations.\n \nEven I tried with exporting and importing keys but no luck.\nRepair and re-install of Datacap is also done but no luck.\n \nPlease let me know if any of had faced similar kind of issue and any solution for it.\n", "id": "DEV_Q212", "answers": [{"answer_id": 86983228, "document_id": "swg1IO24597", "question_id": "DEV_Q212", "text": "", "answer_start": -1, "answer_end": 0, "answer_category": null}], "is_impossible": true}], "context": " SUBSCRIBE TO THIS APAR\nBy subscribing, you receive periodic emails alerting you to the status of the APAR, along with a link to the fix after it becomes available.

In most instances, this object is the attribute that was put into the session object; however, sometimes this object is referenced by an attribute of the session object. \n\n To determine which attribute of the session object references this non-serializable object, access the SessionInspectServlet.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nImplement the Java.io.Serializable or Java.io.Externalizable interface\n\nWith persistent sessions enabled, any object that is put into the HTTPSession must implement the serializable interface in order for session manager to store the session data outside of JVM.\n\nWhen PMI is enabled, there is a counter for session data size. In order to evaluate this counter, the session data must be serialized into a byte array stream. Any object that is put into the HTTPSession must implement the serializable interface in order for session manager to convert the session data objects into byte array stream.\n\nFor example:\n\npublic classMyObject implementsSerializable{\n}//end of class MyObject\n\nCheck that all objects placed in the HTTPSession implement the java.io.Serializable or java.io.Externalizable interface.\n\n\n 1. Acess the SessionInspectServlet\n    \n    If the class name printed in the exception is not an object that is explicitly placed into the HTTPSession, use the SessionInspectServlet to determine the attribute in the HTTPSession that references a non-serializable object. \n\n\n\nSessionInspectServlet helps application writers to determine if application is written to support session persistence. SessionInspectServlet helps to: \n\n * Determine attributes present in the session\n   \n * Determine serializable and non-serializable attributes in the session\n   \n * Determine the size of each serializable attribute in session\n   \n * Determine if serializable attribute is implemented properly (if serializable attribute and all its internals are serializable)\n\n\nServlet serializes and deserializes attributes into memory to simulate session persistence; therefore, application writers need not turn on session persistence to run this servlet. However, you can run it with persistent sessions enabled. \n\nHow to Access the SessionInspectServlet: \n 1. com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.httpsession.SessionInspectServlet is shipped with WebSphere Application Server. It is already in the classpath and does not need to be added to the application. \n    \n    Define a servlet/uri entry for class SessionInspectServlet. If ServeServletsByClassnameEnabled is set to true (check the ibm-web-ext.xmi file in the WEB-INF directory of your webModule) in your webModule, servlet/uri definition is not needed. \n    \n 2. Restart your Web module.\n    \n 3. Open a browser and access your Web module from the browser, then navigate the application in the browser to populate the session.\n    \n 4. Press Crtl+N to open a new browser, then access the SessionInspectServlet in the new browser by calling the URI that you defined in step 2. If you are using ServeServletsbyClassname, the URI will be \"webapp_context_root\\servlet\\com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.httpsession.SessionInspectServlet\". This displays the session details at that moment. You can access the servlet as you navigate your application to determine the session contents as you go along. Note: The servlet does not support attributes in the session that are outside the WebSphere Application Server scope. That is, session contents need to be accessed by the server class loader scope.\n\n \n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers Runtimes for Java Technology Java SDK", "document_id": "swg21066791"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What IBM Business Process Manager version is affected by the Apache Commons FileUpload vulnerability CVE-2016-1000031?

Service for these components is provided when and if required.\n   \n   \n * Apache Axis2\u2122 \n   Axis2 is an open source web services engine from the Apache Software Foundation and is used within CICS to provide the web service Java\u2122 engine for the Axis2 JVM server environment. Service for this component is provided when and if required.\n   \n   \n * WebSphere Application Server Liberty Profile\n   Liberty fix packs are provided on a regular basis through the CICS TS APAR delivery process and provide an update mechanism to keep the embedded CICS Liberty runtime synchronized with the fix packs provided by WebSphere Application Server. Keeping current helps you resolve problems faster for 2 reasons:  * Liberty APAR fixes (known as ifixes) can only be delivered on the latest Liberty fix pack that has been supplied by the CICS APAR process. \n    * CICS APAR fixes can require other fixes such as WebSphere Liberty fix packs.\n   \n   \n   \n\nCICS Explorer and z/OS Explorer\nThe CICS Software Development Kit (SDK) for Java includes components from CICS for developing CICS Java applications. The CICS SDK for Servlet and JSP support includes Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) and Liberty API libraries, and automatically installs required components such as WebSphere Developer Toolkit (WDT).\" Service for these components is provided through the CICS Explorer fix pack process when and if required. \n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27048530&amp;aid=4] Back to Top \n\n\nUpdate recommendations\n\nRecommended Service Upgrade (RSU) \nIBM recommends that you install all RSU [http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/support/servicetest/] PTFs as preventive software maintenance for CICS TS. An RSU is a predefined collection of PTFs identified with a SOURCEID of RSUyymm, where yy indicates the last 2 digits of the year and mm indicates the month. [http://www-03.ibm.com/servers/eserver/zseries/zos/servicetst/]You can order an RSU [http://www-1.ibm.com/servers/eserver/zseries/zos/servicetst/]from ShopzSeries [https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/ShopzSeries/ShopzSeries.jsp].\n\n\nEquinox and Apache Axis2\nThere is unlikely to be much maintenance for Equinox and Axis2. Service for these components is provided when and if required, meaning it will be on a case by case basis and in most cases this will be to resolve service requests.\n\n\nWebSphere Application Server Liberty Profile\nRefer to Updating Liberty profile for CICS TS and z/OS Connect EE to latest version [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21993579] for a list of APARs you will need to update CICS TS and z/OS Connect Enterprise Edition (EE) to the latest version of WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile. \n\n\nCICS Explorer\nIBM recommends that you upgrade to the latest release of CICS Explorer to obtain the most recent functionality and service. Old releases of CICS Explorer are not generally updated with new function, but new CICS Explorer releases are compatible with all earlier versions of CICS TS. Therefore, CICS Explorer V5.4 is compatible with CICS TS V4.1 through V5.4.

When I perform a process listing or list the threads the OnDemand server has spawned, there is an abnormally high number.\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nThe ARS_NUM_DBSRVR parameter specifies the size of the connection pool, which all database requests in OnDemand must use. On Unix\u00ae, this configuration is specified in the ars.cfg file under the ARS_NUM_DBSRVR parameter. On Windows\u00ae, this is specified in the Configurator. \n\nOn initialization, OnDemand creates and maintains a number of persistent connections to the database based on this parameter. If the connections in the pool are all currently busy, subsequent requests will be queued and seem hung, waiting for a free connection. This means setting a value too low will cause database requests to queue up and bottleneck (an accumulation of arssockd processes or threads will then occur), while setting a value too high will consume unnecessary memory, CPU, and database resources. The default value is 4, but for most production environments this number is insufficient. Generally, one database subserver can service 25 users, but this sizing is dependent on the length of the database request, hardware, and system performance. \n\nThe following is a list of common operations that will require a database subserver connection:\n\n\n * User operations. For example, logon, open folder, folder search, and server based text search. \n * Historical logging, such as the System Log and application group logging. For example, if document retrieval logging is enabled, each document retrieval request will require a database subserver connection to log the retrieval in the System Log. \n * OnDemand commands and daemons, such as ARSDOC, ARSLOAD, and ARSMAINT. \n * OnDemand Administrator Client and ARSXML operations. \n\n\nNote: For an OnDemand system that is using DB2\u00ae, ensure that the database configuration parameter MAXAPPLS is configured to at least the ARS_NUM_DBSRVR value or AUTO. \n\nImportant: It is not recommended to set ARS_NUM_DBSRVR to 0 for a production environment. Setting 0 bypasses the connection pool scheme. OnDemand must therefore create and clean up a database connection for each database operation, which is not optimal for performance and allows a limitless number of concurrent connections to be made against your database. \nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe optimal value will depend on each environment and will vary greatly based on the volume of concurrent users, their activities, OnDemand commands and daemons running, and the overall performance of your system (network, database, object server, hardware, and so on).\n\nOne method to tune this configuration is to set it to a starting value. A general starting point is to specify one database subserver for every 25 possible users. Then, simulate your expected user volume and monitor the count of arssockd processes/threads at regular intervals over a period of time. A continual increase in the number of arssockd processes/threads will indicate that requests are being queued and there is a bottleneck, while a steady number will mean either the pool is adequate in size or too large. \n\n\nIf the number continually increases no matter the ARS_NUM_DBSRVR value that is set, this indicates that your system may not be sized properly or requires performance tuning and optimization. The Related information section contains further information on troubleshooting such an issue.\n\nAn example korn script to monitor the number of arssockd threads every 10 seconds:\n\n\n * #!/usr/bin/ksh\n * \n * \n * while(true)\n * \n * do\n * \n * echo `date` arssockd count: `arssockd -I ARCHIVE -p | wc -l`\n * \n * sleep 10\n * \n * done\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n ARS_NUM_DBSRVR Parameter Description [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cmod/v8r5m0/topic/com.ibm.ondemand.installingmp.doc/ars1i071104.htm#wq130]\nWhat causes an accumulation of arssockd processes [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21318327]", "document_id": "swg21474367"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "\n\nI need to install Fixpack 2 on my TCR 2.1.1 environment, but the installation keeps failing with error:\n\n     ACUOSI0050E External command action failed with return code 1.\n\nI was not able to understand why it is failing.

Troubleshooting  * \n\n 1. Check Object Status.  1. Check the object status in the appropriate domain. The Object Status display indicates the operational state of objects in the system. An object on which a service depends might go down, bringing down the service itself. Log into the domain containing the service to examine to use this feature. On the menu, select Status >Object Status to view this information. Object Status is under the is under the System category in the menu. \n    \n    \n 2. Check for messages in the appliance's system log.  1. Check the System Log in the default domain which contains messages generated by all objects in the system.  1. On the Control Panel, click on the Troubleshooting icon. \n         2. Look for the Logging section. \n         3. Click on View System Logs to review this information. \n        \n        \n     2. During development and troubleshooting, set the Log level to debug.  1. On the Control Panel, click on the Troubleshooting icon. \n         2. Look for the Logging section. \n         3. Select \"debug\" in the Log Level selection box. \n         4. Click on the Set Logging Level button to enable this change. \n         5. A confirmation pop-up window will appear, click Confirm. \n         6. Click on View System Logs to review this information. \n        \n        \n    \n    \n 3. Use the MultiStep Probe to view the data as it passes through the appliance.  1. The MultiStep Probe is very useful during troubleshooting and development. This trace displays the life cycle of the message as it passes through the appliance along with useful system variables. \n     2. The Probe must be enabled for a specific service within a domain. \n     3. Reference the WebGUI publication, Troubleshooting Appendix, MultiStep Probe topic for information on troubleshooting with this trace option. \n    \n    \n 4. Check for changes in the configuration or appliance setup.  1. Check the Audit Log in the default domain. The Audit Log records changes to the configuration of the appliance. On the menu on the left side of the WebGUI, select Status > Audit Log to access this information. Audit Log is under the Main category in the menu. \n     2. Check the running configuration in the default domain. The Running Configuration report could show configuration problems or an unexpected configuration running on the appliance. Confirmed your last saved configuration and the current running configuration are defined as you expect.  1. From the CLI, use the show running-config command\n        \n        \n    \n    \n 5. Check for errors posted by the stylesheet.  1. Check the Stylesheet Status in the appropriate domain. The Stylesheet status can contain error messages that are useful in identifying exceptions during compilation or execution of the stylesheet. This also might indicate that a cached stylesheet, rather than a newer version, was used. On the menu on the left side select Status > Stylesheet Status to view this information. Stylesheet Status is under the XML-Aware Network category in the menu. \n    \n    \n 6. Monitor the system resources on the appliance.  1. Check the Throttle settings.

On the menu, select Administration >Throttle Settings to view any active throttles. Throttle Settings is under the Device category in the menu. \n     2. Monitor Filesystem Status in the default domain. The logging system utilize the available file storage space, which prevents the system from writing logs, thus preventing the system from processing messages. On the menu select Status > Filesystem Information to view the available file storage space. Filesystem Information is under the System category in the menu. \n    \n    \n 7. Use the Ping command to provide more information on the network connection.  1. Click on the Troubleshooting icon on the Control Panel. The Ping Remote option under Networking will allow you to ping the IP address or hostname. A pop-up window asks for confirmation when using Ping, then displays the results of the Ping command. \n     2. Ping using the IP address. If the ping command returns \"Action completed successfully! Successful ping to remote host \"testhostname/ip address\", the connection is active. If the command returns a time out or a failure message, one of the following conditions could help identify the problem:  1. The computer that you want to connect to has the ping command disabled, check with the system administrator for that computer. \n         2. The IP address is incorrect; verify the IP address that you are using. \n         3. The computer is not active, ask the system administrator to check the operational status of the computer. \n        \n        \n     3. If you were able to successfully ping the IP address, use the hostname, where hostname is the fully qualified host name of the computer that you want to connect to. If the command returns a time out or a failure message, one of the following could help identify the problem:  1. The host name is incorrect; verify the host name that you are using. \n         2. The Domain Name System (DNS) does not have the host name defined; check with your DNS administrator. \n        \n        \n    \n    \n 8. Run Packet Trace  1. In some instances, it is necessary to capture the full network-level exchange between a appliance and another resource on the network in order to understand what is happening. A Packet Trace contains a capture of network traffic in pcap format.  1. Switch to the default domain. \n         2. On the Control Panel, click on the Troubleshooting icon. \n         3. Look for the Networking section. \n         4. Set the packet capture options available based on your installed firmware level. \n         5. Click on the Packet Capture button to enable this change. \n         6. A confirmation pop-up window will appear, click Confirm. \n         7. Click on Download Packet Capture to view the packet trace using a tool that reads the pcap trace format. \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\n3.

Realistically, more than two jobs are involved because other functions (such as signon, licensing, and so on) must also be called to make the connection. However, in this document we will consider only the primary function being called.\n\nExamples\n\n\n\nFunction / service Daemon Job Server Job Database Access QZDASRVSD QZDASOINIT Remote Command QZRCSRVSD QZRCSRVS \nThe host server daemon jobs are started with the STRHOSTSVR command. All the host server daemon jobs can be started by running the STRHOSTSVR *ALL command. Or, selected daemon jobs can be started by prompting the command and specifying only the services to start (*DATABASE, *RMTCMD, and so on). \n\nThe prestart jobs are normally configured to start automatically when the subsystem they run in is started. Or, they can be started manually using the STRPJ command; for example, STRPJ SBS(QUSRWRK) PGM(QZDASOINIT). \n\nOn IBM OS/400 R450 and later, many prestart jobs that had formerly run in other subsystems have been changed so they now run in the QUSRWRK subsystem. If these prestart jobs cannot start in QUSRWRK, they default to starting as BCI (Batch Immediate) jobs in the subsystem that the server daemon for the same function runs in (QSYSWRK for most servers). \n\nExample: What happens if the QUSRWRK subsystem is not started (using the system's default values): \n\nA request is received for a database access connection. The system finds the QZDASRVSD daemon job that is running as a BCH (Batch job) in the QSERVER subsystem. The system checks the QYSMSVRE user index to determine where connections of this type from this TCP/IP address should be routed. \n\nThe default for the database access server is a QZDASOINIT prestart job in the QUSRWRK subsystem. Because the QUSRWRK subsystem is not active, the system does not find any QZDASOINIT prestart jobs. The daemon will check the QYSMSVRE index for the alternate action to take when the prestart job is not available. The default action is to run in the default subsystem (the same subsystem that the daemon job is runs in) as a BCI job. The daemon will evoke a batch immediate QZDASOINIT job in the QSERVER subsystem. The BCI job is created using the QZDASRVSD BCH job as a model and all attributes of the new QZDASOINIT BCI job are identical to those of the existing QZDASRVSD batch job. \n\nThe Problem: This can cause confusion when trying to change attributes for the host server BCI jobs. This document addresses the need to change the logging level for a host server job. The default logging level for the QZDASOINIT jobs is set at 4 00 *NOLIST. The text, *NOLIST, tells the system not to spool a job log if the job ends normally. Because many error conditions do not cause a job to end abnormally, it is sometimes desirable to have a job log spooled even though the job ended normally. To do this, the logging level for the job must be set at 4 00 *SECLVL. \n\nIf the QZDASOINIT jobs in the previous example were running as prestart jobs in the QUSRWRK subsystem, the following steps are taken (from an operating system command line) to change the logging level of the prestart jobs: 1. On the operating system command line, type the following:\n\nWRKJOB JOB(QZDASOINIT) 2. Select Option 1 to select any active QZDASOINIT job, and press the Enter key. 3. Select Option 2 to Display job definition attributes, and press the Enter key. 4. Make a note of the Job Description being used and the library it is in (for QZDASOINIT this is typically QDFTJOBD in QGPL). 5. Press the Enter key to leave the Display Job Definition Attributes screen. 6. On the operating system command line, type the following:\n\nWRKJOBD JOBD(QGPL/QDFTJOBD) 7. Select Option 2 to Change QDFTJOBD, and press the Enter key. 8. Press F10 for Additional Parameters, 9. Page down, and locate Message Logging. 10. Make a note of the current value for Message Logging text (you will want to return to this value after collecting your JOBLOG). 11. Change the text value to *SECLVL, and press the Enter key. After making the change, the QZDASOINIT prestart jobs must be ended and restarted for the change to take effect. You might want to do this at a time when no one is using the database host server functions so you do not inadvertently end someone's job. To end and restart the prestart jobs, do the following: a. On the operating system command line, type the following:\n\nENDPJ SBS(QUSRWRK) PGM(QZDASOINIT) OPTION(*IMMED) b. Once the jobs have ended, on the operating system command type the following:\n\nSTRPJ SBS(QUSRWRK) PGM(QZDASOINIT) The newly started prestart jobs will be using a logging level of 4 00 *SECLVL. \n\nThe series of steps above will not work to change the logging level of QZDASOINIT jobs that are running as BCI jobs. The steps are similar. To change the logging level of the QZDASOINIT batch immediate jobs, do the following: 1. On the operating system command line, type the following:\n\nWRKJOB JOB(QZDASRVSD) 2. Select Option 1 to select the active QZDASRVSD job, and press the Enter key. 3. Select Option 40 to Change the job, and press the Enter key. 4. Press F10 for Additional Parameters. 5. Page down, and locate Message Logging. 6. Make a note of the current value for Message Logging text (you will want to return to this value after collecting your job log). 7. Change the text value to *SECLVL, and press the Enter key. Because newly started BCI job attributes are identical to the job attributes of the daemon job (in this case, QZDASRVSD), the daemon job will revert back to its original settings if the daemon is ended and restarted. If the desired outcome is to make a more permanent change to the behavior of the BCI jobs, change the setting in the job description used by the daemon job. \n\nSummary \n\nThe steps are the same for the other host server functions. Job names, subsystems, and job descriptions vary depending on which function is being configured to create a job log.  \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Operating System IBM i 6.1 Operating System IBM i 7.1 \nHISTORICAL NUMBER\n 28310354", "document_id": "nas8N1016805"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "\n\nHello.\n\nCould anyone can help to see why I cannot launch RFT 8.2?

Space used for BLOBs/CLOBs and variable length fields not included in the allocated space, will not be returned. This is referred to as the AUX space and managed by the system outside of the RGZPFM command. The only way to regain unused AUX space is RGZPFM ALWCANCEL *NO.\n\nWhen running Reorganize While Active, it is important to understand how this is being implemented.\n\nFirst, the following parameters come into play:\n\nRebuild access paths . > *NO (meaning they are maintained while the RGZPFM is running) \nAllow cancel . . . . . > *YES \n\nNote that the LOCK state parameter will determine if users can read the data or update the data while the RGZPFM ALWCANCEL(*YES) is running.\n\nThe reorganize is moving rows (deleting and inserting). This is being done to get all the deleted records at the bottom of the file. You will see this in the journal by seeing a delete and insert for every row that needs to be moved. This can cause a lot of journal activity and an increase to journal receiver size or number of journal receivers generally expected. These journal entries need to be replayed on any target system.\n\nCommitment control is used when the job is deleting and reinserting the rows. It also moves a set of rows before a commit is issued. The number of rows moved per transaction varies between 1 and 4000. It is up to the system to adjust how many rows it moves before a commit is issued. Production jobs that are running with an isolation level of Cursor Stability or above may wait for rows that have been moved until the commit is issued. The default record wait time out is 60 seconds. If the record wait time has been modified to be much smaller, lock time out errors are possible. \n\nA suggestion to reduce the possibility of row lock waits by production jobs is to have the reorganize job issue OVRDBF FILE(FILE) WAITRCD(1) prior to the reorganize. This will reduce the record wait time the reorganize job is waiting to lock a row and limit the time the set of records are locked. If the job is unable to get a record lock during the 1-second wait time, it will not only skip that row and move on; it will also reduce the number of rows per transaction.\n\nWhen using *SHRUPD lock, it is important to understand how production jobs inserting into the file will affect the RGZPFM job and its ability to return space. After the reorganize job runs through the file one time, it will look to see if any additional rows have been inserted at the end of the file since the reorganize started. The job will note what rows need to be moved and try to move them to get as much space returned as possible. If a row gets inserted at the end of the file after the last rows that needed to be moved were noted, the system will not be able to give back as much space. More activity on the file (inserts) can prevent space being returned. Files set up with Reuse Deleted Records *NO requires all inserts to be placed at the end of the file. This increases the chance of limited space being returned. Files that are set up to Reuse Deleted Records *YES (check via DSPFD) will have a greater chance of production jobs inserting rows in the middle of the file and not impacting the RGZPFM job. There is still a chance that rows can get inserted at the end and prevent space being returned even with Reuse Deleted Records turned on. \n\nFor this reason, you may need to run the RGZPFM several times in order to see space returned. In some cases, a maintenance window is needed to run RGZPFM with no inserts happening. If this is the case, let the reorganize run during the week and move as much as it can and do much of the work. You should perform this work as close to the maintenance window as you can and, if it ends earlier, start another one. Then, during the down time, the reorganize will have less work to do, and down time should be decreased. There is no way to get a perfect estimate how long the RGZPFM will run. \n\nThe system will attempt to truncate any space at the end of the file at the start of the reorg and when it completes normally or cancelled before it finishes. \n\nUse the journal to determine activity that is occurring on the file while the RGZPFM is running (DSPJRN).\nIn addition you can use IBM i Navigator via TechNote N1011091 \"Viewing Status of RGZPFM through IBM i Navigator\"\n\nNOTE: Message CPF503E - User-defined function error on member &4 is normal if a user cancelled the RGZPFM.\n\n\n\n\nHISTORICAL NUMBER\n 631414267", "document_id": "nas8N1011025"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I see this exception in WebSphere Application Server J2c and RRA traces:\n\nWSRdbManagedC > preTestConnection Entry WSRdbManagedConnectionImpl@51a507f2 query: SELECT 1 FROM DUAL WSRdbManagedC 3 Exception java.sql.SQLException: ORA-02396: exceeded maximum idle time, please connect again DSRA0010E: SQL State = 61000, Error Code = 2,396 at oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CTTIoer.processError(T4CTTIoer.java:440) at \n...\nEntry java.sql.SQLException: ORA-01012: not logged on .....

Leap second will be inserted on June 30th 2015, will this cause problems with OMS? \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nOrder Management System uses Unix time and Unix time is defined as the number of seconds since Jan 1st 1970, 00:00 UTC, but without leap seconds. Unix time does not have any way to represent the leap second so instead it uses the same second twice. For example, this is how Unix time looked on January 1st 2009:\n\nUTC Unix clock\n2008-12-31 23:59:59 1230767999 \n2008-12-31 23:59:60 1230768000 <--leap second\n2009-01-01 00:00:00 1230768000 \n2009-01-01 00:00:01 1230768001 \n\nFor applications there is no way to differentiate between the two distinct times but Unix clock implementations handle this problem using Network Time Protocol (NTP). \n\nSo leap second is handled by your operating system and should not cause problem to OMS. \n\nIf you want to check if your clock is synchronized with NTP server and implements the kernel discipline (explained here http://www.ntp.org/ntpfaq/NTP-s-algo-kernel.htm [http://www.ntp.org/ntpfaq/NTP-s-algo-kernel.htm]) you can do the following: on Red Hat run ntptime, you should get something like this \n\nntp_gettime() returns code 0 (OK)\ntime d9369a51.768b9fb0 Thu, Jun 25 2015 17:18:41.463, (.463068202),\nmaximum error 63910 us, estimated error 3825 us, TAI offset 0\nntp_adjtime() returns code 0 (OK)\nmodes 0x0 (),\noffset 6711.977 us, frequency 0.000 ppm, interval 1 s,\nmaximum error 63910 us, estimated error 3825 us,\nstatus 0x2001 (PLL,NANO),\ntime constant 6, precision 0.001 us, tolerance 500 ppm,\n\nIf you however get something like this \n\nntp_gettime() returns code 5 (ERROR)\n...\n\nthat would mean your clock is not synchronized. Stop the ntpd service, synchronize your clock with NTP server and restart the ntpd. For more details on how to do this on Red Hat please see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Deployment_Guide/sect-Date_and_Time_Configuration-Command_Line_Configuration-Network_Time_Protocol.html [https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Deployment_Guide/sect-Date_and_Time_Configuration-Command_Line_Configuration-Network_Time_Protocol.html]\n\nPlease notice that \u201ceven if the operating system does not implement the kernel discipline, the clock will show an error of one second relative to NTP's time immediate after the leap second. The situation will be handled just like an unexpected change of time: The operating system will continue with the wrong time for some time, but eventually ntpd will step the time. Effectively this will cause the correction for leap seconds to be applied too late.\u201d Source http://www.ntp.org/ntpfaq/NTP-s-algo-real.htm#AEN2499 [http://www.ntp.org/ntpfaq/NTP-s-algo-real.htm#AEN2499]", "document_id": "swg21961159"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How to install Packaging utility?

  \n\nERROR DESCRIPTION\n *  When the GSKit JRE is installed along with WebSphere MQ version\n   6, the permissions on the file \"javaws\" may be set to be world\n   writeable.\n   \n   These permissions are not desirable in an environment where\n   security policy restricts world-writeable files.\n   \n   -rwxrwxrwx /opt/mqm/ssl/jre/javaws/javaws\n   \n   ADDITIONAL KEYWORDS: read write execute Java 777 555\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nLOCAL FIX\n *  Manually change the permissions of\n   /opt/mqm/ssl/jre/javaws/javaws to be -r-xr-xr-x\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nPROBLEM SUMMARY\n *  ****************************************************************\n   USERS AFFECTED:\n   Users installing 6.0.2.8 or earlier 6.0.2.x versions of MQ and\n   have opted to install the GSKit JRE\n   \n   Platforms affected:\n   All Unix\n   \n   ****************************************************************\n   PROBLEM SUMMARY:\n   The JRE that MQ uses to create the GSKit installation package\n   contained files which had world-writeable permissions.\n   \n   MQ did not override the permissions of the JRE files that are\n   packaged with the product which meant that it was possible\n   that some of the files may have had permissions which were set\n   in such a way as to have caused them to fail a security audit.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\n *  The file permissions have been corrected and future\n   WebSphere MQ fix packs will not ship world-writeable files\n   in the GSKit JRE.\n   \n   ---------------------------------------------------------------\n   The fix

(SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ):) \nError in processing <OPEN 990 ftp.financialgo.net>command Code = -1\n\n\nCAUSE\nListening on port 990. This port 990 is a well known port for implicit mode FTP/SSL which C:E UNIX does not support. This connection will not work. If the remote must configure to do Explicit mode FTP/SSL then C:E should be configured to connect to it. \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n\n\nConnect:Enterprise UNIX only operates in explicit mode.\n\n\n\nConfigure the Server to listen on a port greater than 1024 (above the well know \"Preassigned\" Port range)\n\n\n\nThe difference between implicit and explicit is that the server expects:\n\n\n\n 1. \n 2. \n 3. \n    \n    Implicitly to go directly into an SSL connection \n 4. \n 5. \n 6. \n    \n    Explicitly sending a banner getting an AUTH command and responding with a 234. \n\n\n\ni.e. Implicit mode works just like HTTP(S) where a browser goes directly into SSL handshake with a webserver. In this case, a client goes directly into SSL handshake with an FTP server. 990 is a well known port for this just like 21 is for FTP. \n\n\n\nNOTE:\nAlthough there is nothing special about these ports you can do FTP on 10021 for example, but the idea behind the well known port concept is that you would expect a certain protocol (response) on a certain port. Not always true, but it is the expectation. \n\n \n\nHISTORICAL NUMBER\n PRI28347 \n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n \n\nFact\n\n\nConnect:Enterprise UNIX, Release 2.1.00 \nSCI81254", "document_id": "swg21544877"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How do I modify the JP sheet to include the JOBTASK Long description in the query.

You follow the information in the \"Migrating to the same version on new hardware\" topic within the IBM Business Process Manager product documentation. However, the profile that is created on the target hardware uses the incorrect profile template. \n\nSYMPTOM\nIn the BPMCreateTargetProfile log file, you can see that it invoked the manageprofiles command with the -templatePath BPM_root/profileTemplates/default parameter to create the target profile.\n\n\nCAUSE\nThe Migrating to the same version on new hardware [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v8r0m1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc/topics/cmig_newhw.html] topic in the IBM Business Process Manager product documentation is used for IBM Business Process Manager Advanced profile migration.

New SIB tables are automatically recreated when you start the new created servers. The reason for recreating the SIB tables is because the Messaging Engine UUID is changed after you create the new target profile. \n\nTo find the SIB tables, refer to the Data store tables [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/rjm0640_.html] topic in the WebSphere Application Server product documentation.\n\n \n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n BPM", "document_id": "swg21670813"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Hello,\n\nWe have JDBC applications on WebShpere, LOAD data using ADMIN_CMD.

Especially the \"ClearCase Server Process Group,\" also known as the \"ClearCase\" or \"ClearCase Administrators' group.\"\n   \n\n\nTwo common use cases for multiple albd accounts \n 1. Security policies require ALL accounts to change their passwords every \"n\" days, including service accounts.\n    \n    In this case, the albd account is \"rotated\" every \"n-7\" days from a workstation logged in with domain administration rights.

Different albd accounts for central VOB/view servers and end-user workstations. This is primarily done to prevent albd account issues (account lockouts, etc) on the albd account from impacting the VOB servers themselves.\n    \n\n\nNote 3: In an interop configuration, the ALBD account that is in use on client hosts needs to have this minimum level of access rights: \n * Read information from the VOBs source pools. This is sufficient for normal ClearCase operations like checkin and checkout.\n   \n * Write to the VOBs cleartext pools, This is needed to allow cleartext construction, and file opens will fail (intermittently, with little apparent pattern) if one or more of the albd accounts does not have the necessary access rights.\n   \n * Write to the VOBs derived object pools.

Open that folder. \n * Inside that folder should be a folder called either SPSS 21, 22, 23, 24 or 25 (depending on your specific version). Open that folder. \n * You should see an application called License Authorization Wizard. Double-click that program. \n * The License Authorization Wizard should then launch. \n\n2.
