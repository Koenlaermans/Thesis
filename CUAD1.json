Nothing herein shall preclude any party from seeking damages or other remedies at law or in equity (other than termination of this IP Agreement or any license to any Intellectual Property granted under this IP Agreement) for any breach hereof.\n\nSection 4.3 Termination of Agreement. This IP Agreement will terminate automatically and without need for further action by either party in the event that the Acquisition Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.\n\nSection 4.4 Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this IP Agreement pursuant to Section 4.3, this IP Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties under this IP Agreement, including any obligation to make any assignment or grant any license hereunder, automatically end without any liability against any party or its Affiliates, except as otherwise provided in the Acquisition Agreement and except that the provisions of this Section 4.4, Article V, Section 6.1, Section 6.2, Section 6.6, Section 6.7, Section 6.8, Section 6.9, Section 6.10, Section 6.11, Section 6.12, and Section 6.13 will remain in force and survive any termination of this IP Agreement.\n\nSection 4.5 Bankruptcy. The parties acknowledge and agree that the licenses granted hereunder are licenses of \"intellectual property\" within the meaning of Section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code (\"Section 365(n)\"), which have been licensed hereunder in a contemporaneous exchange for value. The parties further acknowledge and agree that if the Seller (or any of its Affiliates) or the Purchaser (or any of its Affiliates), as applicable (the \"Insolvent Party\"): (i) becomes insolvent or generally fails to pay, or admits in writing its inability to pay, its debts as they become due; (ii) applies for or consents to the appointment of a trustee, receiver or other custodian for it, or makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (iii) commences, or has commenced against it, any bankruptcy, reorganization, debt arrangement, or other case or proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency law, or any dissolution or liquidation proceedings; or (iv) elects to reject, or a trustee on behalf of it elects to reject, this IP Agreement or any agreement supplementary hereto, pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code (\"Section 365\"), or if this IP Agreement or any agreement supplementary hereto is deemed to be rejected pursuant to Section 365 for any reason, this IP Agreement, and any agreement supplementary hereto, shall be governed by Section 365(n) and the other party may elect to fully exercise its rights under this IP Agreement in accordance with Section 365(n). Upon written request from such other party to the Insolvent Party, its applicable Affiliates, or the bankruptcy trustee, of such other party's election to proceed under Section 365(n), such Insolvent Party, its applicable Affiliates, such bankruptcy trustee, or any third party agent shall comply in all respects with Section 365(n), including providing such other party (and its Affiliates) with the Intellectual Property licensed to such other party (and its Affiliates) and not interfering with the rights of such other party (and such Affiliates) as provided in this IP Agreement to obtain access to such Intellectual Property from such Insolvent Party, its applicable Affiliates, the bankruptcy trustee, or any third party agent.   33\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE V CONFIDENTIALITY\n\nEach party shall (and shall cause the other members of its Group and its Affiliates to) hold the Source Code, trade secrets and other confidential information licensed to any of them under this IP Agreement in confidence, and shall protect the confidentiality thereof using at least the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own similar confidentiality or proprietary information, but in no event using less than a reasonable degree of care. Each party shall not (and shall cause the other members of its Group and its Affiliates not to) (i) disclose any such Source Code, trade secrets, or confidential information to any Person other than to (a) those of its employees who have a \"need to know,\" or (b) other third Persons (including customers, suppliers, prospective suppliers, or joint developers), or (ii) use or disclose such Source Code, trade secrets and other confidential information except as necessary to exercise its rights or perform its obligations under this IP Agreement in accordance with any applicable restrictions or obligations with respect thereto, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), under written Contracts (which include confidentiality, use, and disclosure restrictions) normally used by such party to protect its own similar confidential or proprietary information (and in no event less stringent than the terms and conditions of this Article V). This Article V will not apply to Source Code, trade secrets, or other confidential information of a party or any other member of its Group or any of its Affiliates where the other party can demonstrate such Source Code, trade secrets, or other confidential information (A) is or becomes generally known to the public or enters the public domain, other than as a result of a breach of this IP Agreement by such other party or a member of its Group or its Affiliates, (B) was rightfully disclosed to such other party or a member of its Group or its Affiliates by a third Person provided that such other party or member complies with the restrictions imposed by the third Person, or (C) was developed independently by such other party or member or Affiliate without use of or reference to any information disclosed to any of them by such party. If a party or any of members of its Group or its Affiliates is legally required to disclose any of the other party's Source Code, trade secrets, or other confidential information in connection with any legal proceeding, such party shall promptly notify the other party of the foregoing so that the other party may seek to prevent such disclosure or obtain the entry of a protective order or other appropriate protective device or procedure. The disclosing party shall fully cooperate with and aid such other party in connection with the foregoing. If a protective order or other protective device satisfactory to such other party is not obtained, the disclosing party or its applicable member will disclose only that portion of such Source Code, trade secrets, or other confidential information that is legally required to be disclosed (and will notify the other party of which portions are disclosed). Each party shall take steps reasonable under the circumstances to protect the confidentiality of all Source Code, trade secrets, and other confidential information licensed under this IP Agreement by it or its Affiliates to the other party or a member of its Group or any of its Affiliates.   34\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE VI GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\nSection 6.1 Remedies. The sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of this IP Agreement, including the representations and warranties and covenants herein, shall be as set forth in Article 8 of the Acquisition Agreement. The representations and warranties and covenants contained herein shall terminate in accordance with Section 8.4 of the Acquisition Agreement\n\nSection 6.2 Assignment. Neither party may assign (whether by operation of law or otherwise) this IP Agreement, or any of its licenses, rights, privileges or obligations hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other party, and any such attempted assignment shall be void; provided, however, that, following the Initial Closing Date, without any such prior written consent but upon prior written notice to the other party, each party may assign this IP Agreement to: (i) an Affiliate; (ii) a lender for collateral security; (iii) a Person that succeeds to all or substantially all of its business or assets to which this IP Agreement relates in connection with a merger or sale of all or substantially all of its assets to which this IP Agreement relates; or (iv) corporate reorganization of the party in which the ultimate ownership of the party immediately prior to such reorganization is the same as the ultimate ownership of the party immediately after such reorganization. If a Seller Party assigns or transfers any Licensed IP, the Seller shall (or shall cause the applicable Seller Party to) expressly condition such assignment or transfer on the express acknowledgement and agreement of the assignee or transferee that all such Licensed IP is bound by the license grants set forth herein. If Purchaser or a Purchaser Assignee assigns or transfers any Intellectual Property licensed to the Seller Parties pursuant to Section 2.1(c) or Section 2.1(d), the Purchaser shall (or shall cause the applicable Purchaser Assignee to) expressly condition such assignment or transfer on the express acknowledgement and agreement of the assignee or transferee that all such Intellectual Property is bound by such license grants. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this IP Agreement, Article III may only be assigned by a party (and shall be assigned by a party) together with such party's assignment of the Acquisition Agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof. Subject to the foregoing limitations, this IP Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.\n\nSection 6.3 Effect of Merger or Change of Control. Upon a merger or change of control of a party (including, for purposes of this Section 6.3, with respect to Purchaser any Purchaser Licensee and with respect to Seller any Seller Party) (a \"Change of Control Event\") with or to a Person (other than a Person that is a then-current Affiliate of such party) (the \"Buyer\"), the license rights granted under Article II to such party shall not extend to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates existing immediately prior to the Change of Control Event or any of its or their past, current, or future products, systems or services. If as a result of the Change of Control Event such party remains a separate, independent legal entity (or is merged into another Person, where such Person was formed or created for the purpose of the Change of Control Event or where such Person is a then-current Affiliate of such party), then the license rights granted to such party under Article II shall continue in full force and effect. If as a result of the Change of Control Event such party is merged into the Buyer (other than if the Buyer is formed or created for the purpose of the Change of Control Event) or another Person (other than if such Person is formed or created for the purpose of the Change of Control Event or if such Person is a then-   35\n\n\n\n\n\ncurrent Affiliate of such party) or otherwise does not remain a separate, independent legal entity (except if such party is merged into another Person, where such Person was formed or created for the purpose of the Change of Control Event or where such Person is a then-current Affiliate of such party), then (i) the license rights granted to such party under Article II shall be limited to the operation of the business and the products, systems, and services (including Smart Sensing Network Equipment and Public Safety LTE Smartphone Devices, as applicable) of such party existing as of the effective date of the Change of Control Event and Derivative Works and natural evolutions thereof (but, in all cases, with respect to such license rights, subject to Section 2.1(e) or Section 2.2(e), as applicable), and (ii) no rights or licenses granted to such party under Article II may be extended to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates existing immediately prior to the Change of Control Event in connection with any of its or their past, current, or future products, systems or services.\n\nSection 6.4 Acquisitions. If either party acquires a business or a Person that conducts a business covering any of the same products, systems, or services as those covered by any license granted under Article II to such acquiring party (a \"Future Acquisition\") (whether in an asset or equity transaction), any such license shall be deemed to apply to such same products, systems, and services (but no other products, systems or services) of such acquired business or Person; provided, that all Patents acquired in connection with such Future Acquisition are licensed to the non-acquiring party and, in the case of Seller, the Seller Parties or, in the case of Purchaser, the Purchaser Licensees, pursuant to the terms and conditions of this IP Agreement. In such event, any such acquired Person shall be deemed a Seller Party or a Purchaser Licensee hereunder, as the case may be.\n\nSection 6.5 Further Assurances. Each of the parties agrees that from time to time, at the reasonable request and expense of the other party, it shall execute and deliver such other documents and take such other actions as the other party may reasonably request to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this IP Agreement (including any short form documentation evidencing the licenses granted by any Seller Party hereunder or other documentation to perfect or record the rights granted hereunder in the Transferred IP or Licensed IP in any jurisdiction throughout the world). The Seller acknowledges and agrees (including on behalf of the other Seller Parties) that the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates may record and perfect this IP Agreement or such documentation in any jurisdiction throughout the world, and the Seller shall (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to) cooperate therewith, at the Purchaser's expense. The Purchaser hereby requests, and the Seller hereby grants (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to grant) to the Purchaser and its Affiliates, all rights necessary to record this IP Agreement or such documentation with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office, and any equivalent office or agency in any jurisdiction in the world. Seller shall (and shall cause the other Seller Parties) to, between the Effective Date and the Initial Closing Date, cooperate with the Purchaser in connection with the Purchaser's preparation for acquiring the Business, including (i) by reasonably sharing information to prevent any loss of any of the Seller Entities' rights to any Intellectual Property constituting Transferred IP or Licensed IP, and (ii) facilitating between the parties and their respective Affiliates' communication and sharing of information related to this IP Agreement.   36\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 6.6 Governing Law; Forum.\n\n(a) The Laws of the State of Delaware (without reference to its principles of conflicts of law) shall govern the construction, interpretation and other matters arising out of or in connection with this IP Agreement and its schedules (whether arising in contract, tort, equity or otherwise).\n\n(b) Except with respect to (i) the result arising out of the escalation referenced in Section 2.1(b)(iii)(B) and (ii) the result of the escalation referenced in Section 2.1(b)(iii)(F) and any arbitration pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(iii)(F) (other than to enforce any arbitral judgment), the parties hereto irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and the federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware over any Dispute arising out of or relating to this IP Agreements or any agreement or instrument contemplated thereby or entered into in connection herewith or therewith or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Each party hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such Dispute or proceeding will be heard and determined in such courts (and the courts hearing appeals from such courts). The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such Dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum in connection therewith. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW THEN IN EFFECT, EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL OF ANY ISSUE BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS IP AGREEMENT OR THE ACTION OF ANY OF THE PARTIES THERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.\n\nSection 6.7 Severability. If any term or provision of this IP Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remaining terms and provisions of this IP Agreement remain in full force, if the essential terms and conditions of this IP Agreement for each party remain valid, binding and enforceable. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto will negotiate in good faith to modify this IP Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.\n\nSection 6.8 Entire Agreement; Conflicting Provisions. This IP Agreement, together with the other Transaction Agreements and any side letters executed by the parties in connection therewith, and all of the exhibits and schedules appended hereto and thereto, constitute the final, complete and exclusive statement of the parties' agreement on the matters contained herein and therein. All prior and contemporaneous negotiations and agreements between the parties on the matters contained in this IP Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements are superseded by this IP Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, including, but subject to Section 5.5(b) of the Acquisition Agreement, the NDA. In the event of any conflict between any specific provision of this IP Agreement (including Article V) and the provisions of the Acquisition Agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof, the provisions of this IP Agreement will control.\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 6.9 Counterparts. The parties may execute this IP Agreement in multiple counterparts, each of which constitutes an original as against the party that signed it, and all of which together constitute one agreement. This IP Agreement is effective upon delivery of one executed counterpart from each party to the other party. The signatures of all parties need not appear on the same counterpart. The delivery of signed counterparts by facsimile or email transmission which includes a copy of the sending party's signature(s) is as effective as signing and delivering the counterpart in person.\n\nSection 6.10 Amendment. The parties may amend this IP Agreement only by a written agreement signed by the parties and that identifies itself as an amendment to this IP Agreement.\n\nSection 6.11 Waiver. The parties may waive a provision of this IP Agreement only by a writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of the waiver is sought. A party is not prevented from enforcing any right, remedy or condition in the party's favor because of any failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy or in requiring satisfaction of any condition, except to the extent that the party specifically waives the same in writing. A written waiver given for one matter or occasion is effective only in that instance and only for the purpose stated. A waiver once given is not to be construed as a waiver for any other matter or occasion. Any enumeration of a party's rights and remedies in this Agreement is not intended to be exclusive, and a party's rights and remedies are intended to be cumulative to the extent permitted by Law and include any rights and remedies authorized in Law or in equity.\n\nSection 6.12 Notices. Each party giving any notice required or permitted under this IP Agreement will give the notice in writing, and shall be deemed to have been duly given: (i) when received if delivered personally; (ii) when transmitted if sent by facsimile (with transmission confirmed); (iii) the day after it is sent if sent by commercial overnight courier; (iv) upon receipt if sent by certified or registered mail (return receipt requested); or (v) when transmitted if sent by email (with receipt confirmed by recipient).

This Agreement is non-exclusive. RECITALS WHEREAS, the Company has asked to retain Consultant to provide various services to the Company as agreed to by both parties and outlined in Section 3; and WHEREAS, the Consultant has advised the Company of its willingness and desire to provide such services as outlined in Section 3 and on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained, the Parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 1. CONDITIONS. This Agreement will not take effect, and Consultant will have no obligation to provide any service whatsoever, unless and until the Company sends a signed copy of this Agreement to Consultant (either by mail or facsimile copy). The Company shall be truthful with Consultant in regard to any relevant material regarding the Company, verbally or otherwise, or this entire Agreement will terminate and all consideration paid shall be forfeited without further notice. Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company agrees to cooperate with Consultant in carrying out the purposes of this Agreement, keep Consultant informed of any developments of importance pertaining to the Company's business and abide by this Agreement in its entirety. 2. TERM OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement shall be in full force and effect commencing on January 2, 2020 and shall remain in effect for one (1) year or until Consultant completes the services requested. Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement without notice in the event of the bankruptcy, insolvency, or assignment for the benefit of creditors of the other Party. Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with notice, and the effective date of termination shall be the date such notice is received (by mail, overnight delivery, or fax) by the terminated Party. 3. CONSULTING SERVICES. During the term of this Agreement, Consultant will perform the services described below (the \"Consulting Services\") for the Company. (a) Transactional Business (i) Further development of the business plan for the Company's subsidiaries; and 1 ____ ____\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) Seek and advise the Company on the acquisition of potential products for the Company's subsidiaries; and (iii) Assist in negotiating acquisition or merger consideration as required by the Company; and (iv) Setting up meetings between the Company and acquisition candidates and arranging other liaisons between them; and (v) Assist the Company with certain day to day tasks of managing the Company's subsidiaries; and (vi) Assist in the sale of any inventory held by any of the Company's subsidiaries; and (vii) Assist in the sale of any future products acquired, licensed or developed by the Company and or its subsidiaries. 4. STANDARD OF PERFORMANCE. Consultant shall devote such time and efforts to the affairs of the Company as is reasonably necessary to render the services contemplated by this Agreement. Consultant is not responsible for the performance of any services that may be rendered hereunder if the Company fails to provide the requested information in writing prior thereto. The services of Consultant shall not include the rendering of any legal opinions or the performance of any work that is in the ordinary purview of a certified public accountant. Consultant cannot guarantee results on behalf of the Company but shall use commercially reasonable efforts in providing the services listed above. Consultant's duty is to identify prospective acquisition/joint venture companies for the Company. Consultant will in no way act as a \"broker-dealer\" under state securities laws. Because all final decisions pertaining to any particular investment are to be made by the Company, the Company may be required to communicate directly with potential acquisition/joint venture prospective companies. 5. COMPENSATION TO CONSULTANT. As Consultant's entire compensation for its performance under this agreement, the Company shall pay Consultant $250,000,00 cash compensation. In addition, the Consultant shall earn additional cash compensation for the sale of any inventory/assets that were acquired in the acquisition of TCBM Holdings, LLC on November 30, 2019. Any cash compensation paid to Consultant shall be treated as a reduction in principal to the Convertible Note (\"Note\") issued by the Company to Jetco Holdings, LLC (\"Jetco\") on November 30, 2019. For example: The $250,000 cash compensation paid to Consultant shall reduce the Jetco Note principal amount by $250,000. In the event the Consultant were to sale $100,000 of inventory held by the Company, the payout of $100,000 to Consultant will reduce the principal on the Jetco Note by $100,000. Additional compensation to the Consultant for future products sold by the Company, or revenue earned by the Company for services provided will be negotiated by the Company and Consultant at the time of potential revenue recognition. The Consultant will be solely responsible for all tax returns and payments required to be filed with or made to any federal, state or local tax authority with respect to the Consultant's performance of services and receipt of fees under this Agreement. The Company will regularly report amounts paid, if any, to the Consultant by filing Form 1099-MISC and/or other appropriate form with the Internal Revenue Service as required by law. Because the Consultant is an independent contractor, the Company will not withhold or make payments for social security; make consulting contract insurance or disability insurance contributions; or obtain worker's compensation insurance on the Consultant's behalf. The Consultant agrees to accept exclusive liability for complying with all applicable state and federal laws governing self-employed individuals, including obligations such as payment of taxes, social security, disability and other contributions based on fees paid to the Consultant under this Agreement. The Consultant hereby agrees to indemnify and defend the Company against any and all such taxes or contributions, including penalties and interest. 2 ____ ____\n\n\n\n\n\n6. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The Consultant and the Company acknowledge that each will have access to proprietary information regarding the business operations of the other and agree to keep all such information secret and confidential and not to use or disclose any such information to any individual or organization without the non-disclosing Parties prior written consent. It is hereby agreed that from time to time Consultant and the Company may designate certain disclosed information as confidential for purposes of this Agreement. 7. INDEMNIFICATION. Each Party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other Party (the \"Indemnified Party\") from and against any and all claims, damages, and liabilities, including any and all expense and costs, legal or otherwise, caused by the negligent act or omission of the Indemnifying Party, its subcontractors, agents, or employees, incurred by the Indemnified Party in the investigation and defense of any claim, demand, or action arising out of the work performed under this Agreement; including breach of the Indemnifying Party of this Agreement. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any claims, damages, or liabilities caused by the sole negligence of the Indemnified Party, its subcontractors, agents, or employees. The Indemnified Party shall notify promptly the Indemnifying Party of the existence of any claim, demand, or other matter to which the Indemnifying Party's indemnification obligations would apply, and shall give them a reasonable opportunity to settle or defend the same at their own expense and with counsel of their own selection, provided that the Indemnified Party shall at all times also have the right to fully participate in the defense. If the Indemnifying Party, within a reasonable time after this notice, fails to take appropriate steps to settle or defend the claim, demand, or the matter, the Indemnified Party shall, upon written notice, have the right, but not the obligation, to undertake such settlement or defense and to compromise or settle the claim, demand, or other matter on behalf, for the account, and at the risk, of the Indemnifying Party. The rights and obligations of the Parties under this Article shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successors, assigns, and heirs of the Parties. 8. COVENANTS OF CONSULTANT. Consultant covenants and agrees with the Company that, in performing Consulting Services under this Agreement, Consultant will: (a) Comply with all federal and state laws; (b) Not make any representations other than those authorized by the Company; and (c) Not publish, circulate or otherwise use any materials or documents other than materials provided by or otherwise approved by the Company. 3 ____ ____\n\n\n\n\n\n9.

Any failure of Consultant, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other, to comply with any obligation, agreement, or condition herein may be expressly waived in writing, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

Neither Consultant nor the Company shall make or issue or cause to be made or issued, any announcement or written statement concerning this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby for dissemination to the general public without the prior consent of the other Party. This provision shall not apply, however, to any announcement or written statement required to be made by law or the regulations of any Federal or State governmental agency, except that the Party required to disclose shall consult with and make reasonable efforts to accommodate changes to the required disclosure and the timing of such announcement suggested by the other Party. (i) Arbitration and Governing Law. If a dispute arises out of or relates to this contract, or the breach thereof, and if the dispute cannot be settled through negotiation, the parties agree first to try in good faith to settle the dispute by mediation administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Mediation Procedures before resorting to arbitration, litigation, or some other dispute resolution procedure. If they do not reach such solution within a period of 60 days, then, upon notice by either party to the other, all disputes, claims, questions, or differences shall be finally settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules.

Franchise Agreement This Franchise Agreement (the \"Agreement\") is entered into as of the Agreement Date shown on the cover page between Pizza Fusion Holding, Inc., a Florida corporation, and the individual or legal entity identified on the cover page (\"Franchisee\"). If Franchisee is a corporation, partnership, or limited liability company, then the Franchisee's owner(s) are also identified on the cover page. In this Agreement, \"we,\" \"us\" and \"our\" refers to Pizza Fusion Holding, Inc., the franchisor. \"You\" and \"your\" refers to the Franchisee. \"Owners\" means the person(s) listed on the cover page and all other persons whom we may subsequently approve to acquire an interest in Franchisee. \"Operating Principal\" means the person designated as the Operating Principal on the cover page and who meets the criteria in Section 6.15 of this Agreement. RECITALS A. We are in the business of franchising others to operate \"Pizza Fusion\" restaurant businesses, which feature a competitively priced menu of organic and all-natural gourmet pizza and related food specialties, and standards and methods of operation designed to be \"green,\" and which are operated in buildings that bear our interior and/or exterior trade dress (each a \"Restaurant\" or \"Franchised Business\"). B. We have developed a distinctive set of specifications and operating procedures (collectively, the \"System\") for Restaurants. The distinguishing characteristics of the System include: dough, sauce, and other recipes and products that are prepared or manufactured in accordance with our proprietary and/or secret recipes, trade secrets, standards, and specifications that we deem secret (\"Secret Recipe Products\") and other designated and approved products; standards and procedures for business operations, including \"green\" design, construction, and operating practices; equipment layouts, graphics packages and signage, distinctive interior and exterior design and accessories, quality and uniformity of products and services offered; procedures for management and inventory control; training and assistance; advertising and promotional programs; and customer development and service techniques. These are not necessarily all of the elements of the System. We may change, improve, add to, delete from, and further develop the elements of the System from time to time. C. We identify the businesses operating under the System by means of the \"Pizza Fusion\" name and certain other trademarks, service marks, trade names, signs, logos, and other indicia of origin (collectively, the \"Proprietary Marks\"). We may designate other trade names, service marks, and trademarks (and also periodically delete old names and marks) as Proprietary Marks. D. You understand the importance of our high standards of quality, appearance, and service and the necessity of operating your Franchised Business in accordance with this Agreement and our standards, specifications and procedures. Therefore, the parties, who each intend to be legally bound by this Agreement, and for good and valuable consideration, now agree as follows: Page 1 of 39\n\nSource: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n1. RIGHTS GRANTED 1.1. Grant of Franchise. 1.1.1 We grant you the right, and you accept the obligation, to use the Proprietary Marks and the System to operate one Restaurant (the \"Franchised Business\") at the Premises, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The term \"Premises\" means the location shown on the cover page to this Agreement or a location that is determined under process set out in Section 4.1 [Site Selection and Approval] below. 1.1.2 Your rights under this Agreement have limits, such as the following: (a) You have no right to operate the Franchised Business at any location other than the Premises, as described in Section 1.2 [Activities of Franchised Business] below; (b) You have no right to sublicense either the Proprietary Marks or the System to anyone else; and (c) You have no right to use the Proprietary Marks or the System in any manner except as expressly authorized under this Agreement. 1.2. Activities of Franchised Business. 1.2.1 You may operate the Franchised Business only from the Premises, only in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement and the procedures and terms and conditions set forth in the Pizza Fusion Manuals, and only to sell Products to: (a) retail customers for consumption on the Premises or for personal, carry out consumption; and (b) catering and delivery customers who are located within the area specified in Exhibit A as the \"Delivery/Catering and Advertising Area\". We may specify terms and conditions for catering and delivery activities, which may include guidelines and requirements relating to insurance coverage, vehicle use in such activities, and use of a third party phone order processing center as we may require. Without our prior written approval, you may not engage in any other type of sale, including, but not limited to: selling, distributing, or otherwise providing, any services or products to third parties at wholesale, or for resale or distribution by any third party; and selling, distributing or otherwise providing any products and/or services through catalogs, mail order, toll free numbers for delivery, or electronic means (e.g., the Internet). You acknowledge and agree that the sole purpose of the Delivery/Catering and Advertising Area is to specify the geographic area in which you will be authorized to provide catering and delivery services and conduct advertising under the terms of this Agreement, and that the designation of the Delivery/Catering and Advertising Area does not grant, and will not be implied to grant, any territorial rights or protections to you or the Franchised Business, and we reserve all other rights as set forth in Section 1.3 [Our Limitations and Our Reserved Rights] below. 1.2.2 You may advertise and market the Franchised Business and directly solicit customers only within your Delivery/Catering and Advertising Area (subject to Section 9.3 [Regional Fund] below).

The term \"direct solicitation\" includes, but is not limited to, solicitation in person, by telephone, by mail, by e-mail, the internet, or other electronic means, advertising, marketing, and by distribution of brochures, business cards or other materials. 1.2.3. If any of your advertising within the Delivery/Catering and Advertising Area is in media that will or may reach a significant number of persons outside of the Delivery/Catering and Advertising Area, you must notify us in advance and obtain our prior written consent (in addition to the requirements in Section 9.3 [Regional Fund] below). We may periodically establish rules and policies regarding such advertising. Page 2 of 39\n\nSource: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3. Our Limitations and Our Reserved Rights. The rights granted to you under this Agreement are not exclusive. We and our affiliates have the right to conduct any business activities, under any name, and at (or from) any location notwithstanding those business activities' actual or threatened impact on sales of the Franchised Business. For example, we may, among other things, on any terms and conditions we deem advisable, and without granting you any rights therein, do any or all of the following: 1.3.1 We have the right to establish, and license others to establish, Franchised Businesses at any location notwithstanding their proximity to the Franchised Business or the Premises or their actual or threatened impact on sales of the Franchised Business. 1.3.2 We have the right to establish, and license others to establish, businesses under other systems or other proprietary marks, which businesses may offer or sell products and services that are different from the principal products and services offered from the Franchised Business, and which businesses may be located within or outside the Premises, notwithstanding such business' proximity to the Franchised Business or the Premises or their actual or threatened impact on sales of the Franchised Business. 1.3.3 We have the right to acquire and operate any business of any kind or be acquired by another business, notwithstanding such business' actual or threatened impact on sales of the Franchised Business. 1.3.4 We have the right to establish, and license others to establish, Restaurants at any Institutional Facility (as defined below), notwithstanding such Restaurants' proximity to the Franchised Business or their actual or threatened impact on sales of the Franchised Business. The term \"Institutional Facility\" is agreed to mean any outlet that primarily serves the customers located within the facility, such as captive audience facilities and limited purpose or limited access facilities, and includes among other things: airports; train or bus stations; travel plazas; factories; federal, state or local government facilities (including military bases); hospitals and other health-care facilities; stadiums and arenas; recreational facilities; schools, colleges and other academic facilities; convention centers; seasonal facilities; shopping malls; theaters; museums; and workplace cafeterias. 1.3.5 We have the right to sell and distribute, directly or indirectly, through any channels of distribution (including, but not limited to, supermarkets, gourmet shops, mail order, and on the internet) any products or services (including products and services that are the same or similar to those offered by Restaurants and using the Pizza Fusion name), from any location or to any purchaser or customer, advertise in any area (including in your Delivery/Catering and Advertising Area) and/or serve customers who reside within your Delivery/Catering and Advertising Area. You acknowledge that customers have total freedom to select the Pizza Fusion Restaurant that they wish to patronize. 1.3.6 We have the right to provide, and license others to provide, products or services to Major Accounts (as that term is defined below) at any location, notwithstanding such Major Accounts' proximity to the Franchised Business or the Premises or their actual or threatened impact on sales at the Franchised Business. The term \"Major Account\" is agreed to mean any customer we designate as such, based upon our sole determination that, because such customer conducts its business at multiple locations and we deem this customer to be of strategic importance, the account, services and pricing of such customer shall be negotiated and secured either (i) by us or (ii) with our assistance, approval and oversight; as further described in Section 6.12 [Major Accounts] below. 1.4.

This Agreement expires ten (10) years from the Agreement Date (the \"Term\"), unless it is terminated sooner as provided in other sections of this Agreement. 2.2. Successor Franchise Agreements. When this Agreement expires, you will have the option to continue the franchise relationship with us for two (2) additional terms of ten (10) years each. We may require you to satisfy any or all of the following as a condition of continuing the franchise relationship with us: 2.2.1. You must give us written notice of your desire to exercise your option not more than twelve (12) months and not less than nine (9) months before this Agreement expires. 2.2.2. You and all Owners must execute the standard form of Pizza Fusion Franchise Agreement that we are then offering to new franchisees (or the standard form that we most recently offered to new franchisees, if we are not at that time actively offering new franchises) (the \"Successor Franchise Agreement\"). The terms of the Successor Franchise Agreement may be substantially different from the terms of this Agreement and may require the payment of different fees. 2.2.3. You must pay all amounts owed to us, to our affiliates, and to your major suppliers; you must not be in default of this Agreement or any other agreement with us, our affiliates, or our suppliers; and you must have substantially and timely complied with all of your obligations throughout the term of each such agreement. 2.2.4. If we inspect your Franchised Business and give you notice at least six months before the end of the term of any required maintenance, refurbishing, renovating, and upgrading (including purchasing one or more new delivery vehicles); then you must complete all such required maintenance, refurbishing, renovating, and upgrading to our reasonable satisfaction no later than 60 days before expiration of the term. 2.2.5. You must pay us a discounted successor franchise fee in the amount of $7,500 or twenty-five percent (25%) of our then- current initial franchise fee (whichever is more). 2.2.6.

You, the Operating Principal, and/or your designated employees must successfully complete any additional or refresher training courses that we may require. 3. FEES 3.1. Initial Franchise Fee. You must pay us an initial franchise fee of $30,000 when you sign this Agreement. The initial franchise fee is paid in consideration of the rights granted in Section 1 and is fully earned at the time paid. You acknowledge that we have no obligation to refund the initial franchise fee in whole or in part for any reason. 3.2. Royalty 3.2.1. You must pay us a royalty fee (\"Royalty\") equal to six percent (6%) of your Gross Revenues. The Royalty is in consideration of your right to use the Proprietary Marks and the System in accordance with this Agreement, and not in exchange for any specific services we render. If by reason of state or other law, we are prohibited from receiving a percentage of certain components of Gross Revenues (including alcoholic-beverage sales), you must pay us an equivalent amount by increasing the Royalty percentage applied to Gross Revenues exclusive of the prohibited components. Page 4 of 39\n\nSource: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2. You must calculate and pay the Royalty weekly, based on your Gross Revenues for the previous Period. For purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise designated by us in writing, a \"Period\" begins on Monday and ends on the following Sunday. 3.2.3. \"Gross Revenues\" means all revenue from the sale of all services and products and all other income of every kind and nature related to, derived from, or originating from the Franchised Business, including proceeds of any business interruption insurance policies, whether for cash or credit, and regardless of collection in the case of credit; provided, however, that \"Gross Revenues\" does not include any coupon sales (for which customers do not pay for product), customer refunds, sales taxes or other taxes you collected from customers and actually transmitted to the appropriate taxing authorities. 3.3. Advertising Contributions. During any Period that the Marketing Fund (as defined in Section 9.1 [Pizza Fusion Marketing Fund] below) is in effect, you must make a contribution as described in Section 9.1 [Pizza Fusion Marketing Fund] below equal to three percent (3%) of your Gross Revenues for the preceding Period. Additionally, during any Period that a Regional Fund (as defined in Section 9.3 [Regional Fund] below) for the area in which your Franchised Business is located is in effect, you must make a contribution as described in Section 9.2 [Local Marketing] below in such amounts as we specify in writing up to two percent (2%) of your Gross Revenues for the preceding Period; in addition, you may be required to contribute to a Regional Fund up to an additional two percent (2%) of Gross Revenues of your Franchised Business if the members of that Regional Fund vote to increase the total contribution, as provided in Section 9.3.5 [Regional Fund] below. Required contributions to the Marketing Fund and Regional Fund are referred to as \"Advertising Contributions.\" 3.4. Index. The parties agree that all fixed dollar amounts set out in this Agreement are subject to adjustment, up or down, depending on changes in the Index. For the purpose of this Agreement, the term \"Index\" is agreed to mean the Consumer Price Index (1982-84=100: all items; CPI- U; all urban consumers) published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (or if the Index is no longer published, a successor index that we may reasonably specify in the Manuals or otherwise in writing). We have the right to decide whether or not to make adjustments to fixed dollar amounts set out in this Agreement and if we decide to invoke that right, we will make changes not more than once each year by sending you written notice of the change. 3.5. Due Date for Payment. Your Royalty payments and Advertising Contributions are due by the first (1st) day after the end of each Period (or the next business day if the first day is a Sunday or federal holiday) (as of the Agreement Date, the due date is Monday of each week). You must pay all other amounts due to us as specified in this Agreement or, if no time is specified, such amounts are due upon receipt of an invoice from us. 3.6. Method of Payment. You must make all payments to us by the method or methods that we specify from time to time. We require payment via wire transfer or electronic debit to your bank account, and you must maintain sufficient balance in your operating account to meet the payment requirements. You must furnish us and your bank with all authorizations necessary to effect payment by the methods we specify. You may not, under any circumstances, set off, deduct or otherwise withhold any Royalty fees, Advertising Contributions, interest charges, or any other monies payable under this Agreement on grounds of our alleged non-performance of any obligations. Additionally, you authorize us to charge against any of your credit cards any amounts due to us or to any of our affiliates. You agree to supply us a written list of all of your credit cards (including card number, name, and expiration date) and to update that list periodically, if there are changes to the information. Page 5 of 39\n\nSource: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7. Delinquency. If any Royalties or other amounts owed to us are not paid in full by the due date, we have the right to charge interest on the overdue amount at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month (or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, if less than 1.5%) from the date such amount was due until paid in full. Unpaid interest charges will compound annually. In addition, we will have the right to charge a late fee for each occurrence of a payment that is more than 30 days past due, which fee will be $100 for the first such occurrence, $200 for the second such occurrence, and $300 for the third and each subsequent occurrence during the Term of this Agreement. The late fee is to compensate us for our administrative costs incurred in enforcing your obligation to pay us. 3.8. Dishonored Payments. For any amount that you must pay to us or our affiliates, if we are not able to successfully complete a wire transfer or electronic debit for such payment as described Section 3.6 [Method of Payment] above, or if a check that you issue for such payment is returned by the bank against which it was drawn, due to insufficient funds in your account(s), closure of your account(s) or any other reason resulting in the nonpayment (each a \"Dishonored Payment\"), we have the right to charge a fee of $100 per occurrence (a \"Dishonored Payment Charge\"). We will notify you of each Dishonored Payment and any Dishonored Payment Charge that we impose. We may add the Dishonored Payment Charge to the amount to be paid via the next wire transfer or electronic debit. The Dishonored Payment Charge applies in addition to any late fee and interest that we have the right to charge, or any other remedy to which we are entitled, under this Agreement, at law, or in equity. 3.9 Taxes. You are responsible for all taxes levied or assessed on you or the Franchised Business in connection with your activities under this Agreement. 3.10 Obligations Absolute. You agree that your obligations to pay us (as well as our affiliates) under this Agreement or any other agreement in connection to the Franchised Business are absolute and unconditional, and not subject to abatement or setoff for past or future claims that you may assert. 3.11 Security Agreement. Upon our written request, you agree to grant to us a first-priority security interest in all of your assets (including all proceeds thereof and after-acquired property), as security for all your monetary and other obligations to us or our affiliates arising under or relating to this Agreement or any other agreement. Such assets include all furniture, fixtures, machinery, equipment, inventory and all other property, (tangible or intangible), that you now own or later acquire, used in connection with the Franchised Business, and wheresoever located as well as all contractual and related rights you have under this Agreement and all other agreements between the parties. If we request, you must execute such financing statements, continuation statements, notices of lien, assignments or other documents as we may require in order to perfect and maintain our security interest, including but not limited to a UCC-1 Financing Statement. Alternatively, you authorize us to execute any of the foregoing financing statements, continuation statements, notices of lien, assignments, and/or other documents on your behalf, or on our own (in our name), describing the collateral in such manner as we consider appropriate. You hereby grant us an irrevocable power of attorney, coupled with an interest, to execute, in your name, any of such financing statements, continuation statements, notices of lien, assignments or other documents. You must pay all filing fees and costs for perfecting our security interest. 4. SITE SELECTION, PREPARATION, AND OPENING DEADLINE 4.1. Site Selection and Approval. You will be responsible, at your own expense, for finding and then acquiring, by lease or purchase, a suitable site at which to develop and operate your Franchised Business (the \"Premises\"). Any sites that you propose must be within the area identified in Exhibit A (the \"Site Selection Area\").

(c) We will provide, at no charge, our standard image specifications for the construction of the Franchised Business, improvement of the premises, and for the layout of fixtures, furnishings, equipment, and signs.

You may not lease or otherwise acquire the right to occupy the proposed site without our prior written approval. 4.2 Site Lease or Acquisition.

We will not unreasonably withhold our approval of special plans and specifications, prepared at your expense, when the Approved Location will not accommodate our standard plans and specifications, provided that such plans and specifications conform to our general design criteria. You will be responsible for the design and layout that your architect or engineer prepares. If we express an opinion about the plans or indicate our approval, it will be merely for the purpose of our own determination that your plans will satisfy our internal standards, specifications, and layout. We will not be in a position to provide any assurances, and therefore can not be deemed to have given any information about, whether your plans satisfy any federal, state, and local laws, codes and regulations (including, without limitation, the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\")). (b) After obtaining any required governmental approvals and clearances, you must submit to us, for our approval, final plans for construction based upon the preliminary plans and specifications. Once approved by us, such final plans may not be changed or modified without our prior written consent.

You must open the Franchised Business within seven days after obtaining our written approval for opening, unless we agree in writing to extend this deadline. 4.4. Our Review. Any reviews that we conduct under this Section 4 are only for our benefit. You acknowledge that our review and approval of a site, lease, sublease, design plans or renovation plans for a Franchised Business do not constitute a recommendation, endorsement, or guarantee of the suitability of that location or the terms of the lease, or sublease, or purchase agreement. You agree that you will take all steps necessary to determine for yourself whether a particular location and the terms of any lease, sublease, or purchase agreement for the site are beneficial and acceptable to you. 4.5 Opening Deadline. You must begin operating the Franchised Business by the opening deadline specified in Appendix A. The date you actually open the Franchised Business is the \"Opening Date.\" 4.6 Relocation and other Uses of the Premises. You may not relocate the Franchised Business from the Premises without our prior written consent. You may only use the Premises for the purpose of operating your Franchised Business and for no other purpose. You may not sublet or otherwise allow any other party to operate any enterprise at your Premises without our prior written approval. 5. TRAINING 5.1. Initial Training Program 5.1.1. Before you begin operating, the two persons who you designate (and who we find acceptable) to provide managerial responsibilities (each a \"Manager Trainee\") must all successfully attend (at the same time) and successfully complete our initial training program (we may designate portions of the training program that each person must attend and successfully complete), which is held at our headquarters and/or another location(s) that we specify. One Manager Trainee must be your Operating Principal (who meets the criteria in Section 6.15 of this Agreement), unless we mutually agree otherwise. You may designate another person who will be active in the day-to-day activities and management of the Franchised Business to be the second Manager Trainee. You may ask that additional employees be allowed to attend the portions of the initial training that are designed for your employees, and we will have the right to approve or disapprove that request. All trainees must be persons that we find acceptable at all times to serve in their respective capacities. As of the Effective Date, our training program has two components, as follows: (a) An Advanced Operations Course for your Operating Principal, which consists of up to twelve days for your Operating Principal and is conducted at our training facilities in Broward County, Florida, or at another location that we may specify in writing. (b) A Basic Operations Course for any Manager Trainee other than your Operating Principal, which consists of up to twelve days of training and is conducted at our training facilities in Broward County, Florida, or at another location that we may specify in writing. Your Manager Trainees (other than your Operating Principal), and such of the Franchisee's other employees as we designate must attend this component of training. 5.1.2. We will issue a certificate of completion for each Manager Trainee who completes the initial training program we require to our satisfaction (each such person will be referred to as a \"Certified Manager\"). We have the right to determine whether a person has or has not successfully completed training. If you (or your personnel) fail to complete initial training to our satisfaction, we may permit you (or they) to repeat the course or allow you to send a substitute to the next available scheduled training session; however, we will have no obligation to extend the opening deadline in Section 4 for this purpose. Page 10 of 39\n\nSource: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3. We have the right to reduce the duration or content of the training program for any trainee who has prior experience with our concept or in similar businesses. We also may allow you to train certain of your managers (which may include Certified Managers) and successors in those positions at your location. 5.1.4. Failure to complete the initial training program constitutes grounds for termination, as provided in Section 15 of this Agreement. 5.2. Opening Training and Assistance. We provide up to fourteen (14) days of pre-opening training and opening assistance at your Premises. The Operating Principal and the other Manager Trainee and such of your other employees as we designate must attend this component of training, which will begin approximately seven days before the Opening Date and conclude approximately seven days thereafter. 5.3. Additional Training by Us. We may require your Certified Managers and/or other designated persons to successfully complete additional training courses during the Term of this Agreement at a location that we specify (including an annual conference for franchisees in the System). We may also offer optional training programs. You may also request that we provide additional training at the location of your Franchised Business, and we will provide such training if we determine that we are able to do so. We may charge you a training fee and our out-of-pocket expenses for all additional training programs, whether mandatory or optional, or whether you request or we require such training, which fee shall be as set forth in the Manual or otherwise in writing. 5.4. Training by You. We have the right to specify training programs related to the System that you must conduct for your employees using approved training materials or that we will provide at our headquarters. For any training of your personnel that we conduct, you are responsible for expenses incurred while they attend training, including salaries, benefits, travel, lodging, meals, and other related expenses. We reserve the right to charge you for training additional personnel. 5.5. Training Materials and Methods. All training materials that we provide to you remain our property. We have the right to provide training programs in person, on tape, via the Internet or other electronic means, or by other means and media, as we determine. 5.6. Expenses. We will provide instructors, facilities, and materials for the initial training program at no charge, provided that all of your personnel are trained during the same training session. We reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee for training additional personnel (in excess of two), re-training persons who are repeating the course or replacing a person who did not pass. For all training, including initial training, you are responsible for any travel expenses, living expenses, wages, and other expenses incurred by your trainees. 6. OPERATIONS 6.1. Compliance with Standards. You agree to comply with all mandatory specifications and procedures set forth from time to time in our confidential operating manual (the \"Manual\"). You acknowledge that the accounting practices, record keeping, software, services, and operation of your Franchised Business are important to us and our other franchisees. However, you acknowledge that we have the right to vary our standards and specifications, in our reasonable judgment, to accommodate circumstances of individual franchisees. 6.2. Products and Services You May Offer. You may offer customers only the products and services that we have expressly authorized Franchised Businesses to offer, as we have the right to specify in the Manual from time to time. We have the right to change the authorized products and services, and we may designate specific products or services as optional or mandatory (including alcoholic beverages). You acknowledge that we may approve some services, products, and other items for certain franchisees and not others based on legitimate business reasons. You must use menus that meet our then-current specifications as to content, materials, finish, style, pattern, and design.

The Secret Recipe Products are our proprietary products. In order to maintain the high standards of quality, taste, and uniformity of these products and protect the proprietary nature of these products, you agree to purchase the Secret Recipe Products only from us, our affiliates or from sources that we designate or approve and license 6.4 Sourcing of Other Products, Equipment and Supplies. 6.4.1. Without limiting Section 6.3 [Secret Recipe Products] above, we have the right to require that all of the food items, equipment (including but not limited to vehicles used in connection with the Franchised Business), supplies, materials, and other products and services used or offered for sale at your Franchised Business: (a) meet specifications that we establish from time to time; and/or (b) be purchased only from suppliers that we have expressly approved; and/or (c) be purchased only from a single source (which may include us or our affiliates or a buying cooperative that we organize). To the extent that we establish specifications, require approval of suppliers, or designate specific suppliers for particular items, we will publish our requirements in the Manual. 6.4.2. If you would like to use or offer food items (other than the Secret Recipe Products), equipment, supplies, materials, and other products and services that we have not approved, or purchase from a vendor, supplier, distributor, or other source (together, \"supplier(s)\") that we have not approved, then you must submit to us a written request for approval. We have the ongoing right to inspect any proposed supplier's facilities and to test samples of the proposed products or services. You agree to pay us an amount not to exceed the reasonable cost of the inspection and our actual cost of testing the proposed product or service, including personnel and travel costs, whether or not we ultimately approve the supplier. We have the right to grant, deny, or revoke approval of products, services, and suppliers. We will notify you in writing of our decision as soon as practicable following our evaluation. We reserve the right to reinspect the facilities and products of any approved supplier and to revoke approval if we find that the supplier fails to meet any of our then-current criteria. If you receive a notice of revocation of approval, you agree to immediately stop buying products or services from the disapproved supplier and, in the case of revocation based on failure of products to meet our standards, you agree to dispose of your remaining inventory of the disapproved supplier's products as we direct. 6.4.3. If you wish to test market an item that we have not approved, then, so long as we have given you our prior written approval, you may do so for so long, and on such terms, that we mutually agree upon (a \"Test\"), and the item so tested, and all associated formulae, plans, and materials, will become our property. If, following the Test, we determine that we will approve the tested item, then for so long as we deem that item to be an \"approved item\" under this Agreement, you will have the right to use that item under the terms of this Agreement; and we will have the right to use and market that item as we see fit, including but not limited to use in our own Restaurants as well as that of other licensees and franchisees, without compensation to you. You agree to sign such documents (and require your employees and any independent contractors that you have engaged to sign such documents) as we may require in order to implement the provisions of this Section 6.4.3 [Sourcing of Other Products, Equipment and Supplies]. 6.4.4. We and our affiliates may receive payments or other compensation from suppliers on account of such suppliers' dealings with you and other franchisees; and, we may use all amounts so received for any purpose we and our affiliates deem appropriate. 6.5. Delivery Vehicles. If you wish to use a vehicle to provide delivery services (a \"Delivery Vehicle\") as part of your Franchised Business, you must comply with the specifications and standards that we may periodically prescribe in the Manuals for Delivery Vehicles. Our specifications and standards may include, among other things: designating Delivery Vehicles specific make and model; limitations on the Useful Life for a Delivery Vehicle and standards for maintenance or repair services. Page 12 of 39\n\nSource: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n6.5.1. The term \"Useful Life\" means the period of time after which you must stop using the Delivery Vehicle for the Franchised Business. We have the right to determine the Useful Life of any Delivery Vehicle, which may include reasonable standards as to how many model years old the vehicle may be, the appearance of the vehicle, and the performance of the vehicle. After the Useful Life, you must remove all Proprietary Marks and any other indicia associating the Delivery Vehicle with the System, and immediately purchase or lease a new Delivery Vehicle. 6.5.2. We have the right to specify the makes and models of Delivery Vehicles approved for use by our franchisees, and anticipate that we will make changes over time to reflect and take advantage of advances in technology and/or alternative energy powered vehicles. 6.6. Alcohol Permits. Before you begin operating the Franchised Business you must obtain, and at all times thereafter you must maintain, all licenses and permits required to sell, dispense, and store beer and wine beverages and be prepared to offer and sell such beer and wine products to customers at the Premises as we designate as mandatory product offerings, unless you obtain from us a written waiver of this requirement.

Customer Service Program. You acknowledge that providing superior customer service is a vital component of the System. You must participate in customer service programs, which we have the right to specify from time to time in the Manual. Such programs may include the use of independent evaluation service to conduct \"mystery customer\" quality control, customer satisfaction surveys, or any other quality control or evaluation programs. If you receive an unsatisfactory or failing report in connection with any such program, you must immediately implement any remedial actions we require and pay us all expenses we incurred to have the evaluation service evaluate the Franchised Business, and all expenses we may have incurred to inspect the Franchised Business thereafter. 6.11.

You acknowledge that our negotiation of Major Accounts, including rates and services to be performed, enhances the potential value of the System and inures to your benefit as well as to our benefit and that of other Restaurant franchisees. As noted in Section 1.3 [Our Limitations and Our Reserved Rights] above, we reserve the right to provide products and services to all Major Accounts. We may offer you the right to provide products and services to a Major Account within your Delivery/Catering and Advertising Area. If you accept the obligation to provide products and services to a Major Account, you must service such Major Account on our behalf, in accordance with the pricing and other terms that we negotiate with the Major Account customer. You may not enter into any relationship with a Major Account customer that we deem to conflict with the customer's Major Account arrangement with us. We will have the right to handle all billing and collection for services performed under a Major Account arrangement. Certain Major Account customers may require that we provide additional volume rebates, which we will negotiate with the customer on a case-by-case basis. You will have the option not to provide products or services to any Major Account customer that is offered to you. 6.12.2. We may terminate your right to provide products and services to a Major Account customer at any time by giving you at least 30 days' prior written notice, and you may terminate your right to provide products and services to a Major Account at any time by giving us at least 30 days' prior written notice. If we elect not to offer you the opportunity to provide products or services to a Major Account, if you decline the option to accept a Major Account, if your right to provide products or services to a Major Account terminates, or if you fail to satisfy the conditions and obligations of any Major Account agreement, we have the right to service and/or authorize others to service Major Account customers within your Delivery/Catering and Advertising Area without any compensation to you. We have no obligation to permit you to provide products or services to a Major Account or to transfer any Major Account customer to you if you are subsequently willing and able to provide service. 6.13.

If we notify you of any deficiencies after the inspection, you must promptly take steps to correct them. If you fail to correct any deficiencies within a reasonable time, we have the right to correct such deficiencies and to invoice you for our expenses. 6.14. Compliance with Laws. You agree to operate the Franchised Business in full compliance with all applicable municipal, county, state, and federal laws, rules, regulations, and ordinances.

You may not permit the Franchised Business to be operated, managed, directed, or controlled by any other person without our prior written consent.

Such refurbishment may include structural changes, installation of new equipment and signs, remodeling, redecoration, and modifications to existing improvements, and, shall be completed pursuant to such standards, specifications, and deadlines as we may reasonably specify. 6.19. Insurance. 6.19.1. Types and Amounts of Coverage. Throughout the entire Term, you must maintain such types of insurance, in such amounts, as we may require. Such insurance is in addition to any other insurance that may be required by applicable law, your landlord, or otherwise.

For this purpose, you must purchase the software, hardware, and other items needed to sell and process gift cards, as we may specify in writing in the Manuals or otherwise. You must also pay such monthly and per-swipe transaction fees as may be required by the vendor of the gift card system. You must sell or honor gift cards only in accordance with our written standards. You must not sell, issue, or redeem gift certificates other than gift cards we have approved in writing. 10.8 Use of the Proprietary Marks. You agree not to use or permit the use or display of the Proprietary Marks as part of any Internet domain name or website, or any other electronic identifier (including but not limited to e-mail addresses, account names in a social media site, and the like) of you or the Franchised Business in any forum or medium. 10.9 Identification of the Franchised Business. You must use, and only use, the email address and other identifiers we designate in connection with the business of the Franchised Business. You agree not to transmit or cause any other party to transmit advertisements or solicitations by e-mail or other electronic media without first obtaining our written consent as to: (a) the content of such e mail advertisements or solicitations; and (b) your plan for transmitting such advertisements. In addition to any other provision of this Agreement, you will be solely responsible for compliance with any laws pertaining to sending e-mails including but not limited to the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Proprietary Marketing Act of 2003 (known as the \"CAN-SPAM Act of 2003\"). 10.10 Changes to Technology. Because changes to technology are dynamic and not predictable within the term of this Agreement, and in order to provide for inevitable but unpredictable changes to technological needs and opportunities, you agree: (a) that we will have the right to establish, in writing, reasonable new standards to address new technologies, and to implement those changes in technology into the System; and (b) to abide by our reasonable new standards as if this Section 10 were periodically revised for that purpose. 10.11 E-Mail and Fax Communication. You agree that exchanging information with us by e-mail and fax is an important way to enable quick, effective, and efficient communication, and that we are entitled to rely upon each other's use of e-mail and faxes for communicating as part of the economic bargain underlying this Agreement. To facilitate the use of e-mail and fax to exchange information, you authorize the transmission of e-mail by us and our employees, vendors, and affiliates (on matters pertaining to the business contemplated hereunder) (together, \"Official Senders\") to you and your employees during the term of this Agreement.

OPERATING MANUAL We will furnish you with one copy of, or electronic access to, the Manual, on loan, for as long as this Agreement or a Successor Franchise Agreement remains in effect. We reserve the right to furnish all or part of the Manual to you in electronic form or online and to establish terms of use for access to any restricted portion of our website. You acknowledge that we own the copyright in the Manual and that your copy of the Manual remains our property. You agree to treat the Manual, training materials, and any other manuals or materials created or approved by us for use with the System as secret and confidential.

You may divulge confidential information only to your professional advisers and to your employees who must have access to the information to operate the Franchised Business. All information, knowledge and know-how relating to us, our business plans, or the System are deemed confidential for purposes of this Agreement, except information that you can demonstrate came to your attention by lawful means prior to our disclosure; or which, at the time of our disclosure to you, had become a part of the public domain. You must require your employees, and any other person or entity to which you wish to disclose any confidential information, to execute (and deliver to us upon our request) agreements, in the form provided in Appendix C to this Agreement or as we may otherwise require in writing, that they will maintain the confidentiality of the disclosed information. If you do not obtain execution of the covenants required by this Section 12 and, upon our request, deliver those signed agreements to us, that will constitute a default under Section 15.2.13 [Termination By Us Without A Cure Period] below.

TRANSFERS BY US We have the unrestricted right to transfer or assign all or any part of our rights and/or our obligations under this Agreement to any person or legal entity without your consent. You agree that we will have no liability after the effective date of transfer or assignment for the performance of, or for any failure to perform, any obligations we have transferred. We also have the absolute right to delegate to others the performance of any of our duties, obligations, or benefits under this Agreement, to third parties (including, without limitation, an area developer under the terms of an area development agreement with us), which will not be parties to an agreement with you. 14. TRANSFERS BY YOU 14.1. Definition of Transfer. In this Agreement, \"Transfer\" as a verb means to sell, assign, give away, pledge, or encumber, either voluntarily or by operation of law (such as through divorce or bankruptcy proceedings), any interest in this Agreement the rights and/or obligations under this Agreement, all or substantially all of the assets of the Franchised Business, and/or any direct or indirect interest in the ownership of Franchisee (if the Franchisee is a corporation, partnership, or limited liability company). \"Transfer\" as a noun means any such sale, assignment, etc. 14.2. No Transfer without Our Prior Written Consent. Neither you nor any of the Owners may make any Transfer or permit any Transfer to occur without obtaining our prior written consent. We have the right to withhold our consent, except as otherwise provided in Sections 14.3 [Transfer of Entire Business] through 14.8 [Our Right of First Refusal]. We have the right to communicate with and counsel both you and the proposed transferee on any aspect of a proposed Transfer. If a Transfer requires our consent, then that transaction may not take place until at least sixty (60) days after we receive written notice of the proposed Transfer. You agree to provide any information and documentation relating to the proposed Transfer that we reasonably require. Unless otherwise agreed, we do not waive any claims against the transferring party if we approve the Transfer. 14.3. Transfer of Entire Business. For a proposed Transfer of the Franchised Business or this Agreement (or, if Franchisee is a corporation or other entity, a Transfer of ownership interests that would result in a change of control of Franchisee), the following conditions apply (unless waived by us): 14.3.1. You must be in compliance with all obligations to us under this Agreement and any other agreement you have with us and our affiliates as of the date of the request for our approval of the Transfer, or you must make arrangements satisfactory to us to come into compliance by the date of the Transfer. 14.3.2. The proposed transferee must complete all of the following requirements: (a) Demonstrate to our satisfaction that he or she meets all of our then-current qualifications to become a Pizza Fusion franchisee, and, at our request, the proposed transferee must travel (at his or her expense) to our principal office for an interview. (b) Sign our then-current standard form of franchise agreement (or the standard form most recently offered to new franchisees, if we are not then offering franchises to new franchisees) for the then-remaining balance of the Term of this Agreement, and such other ancillary agreements we require for new Franchised Businesses. Their new franchise agreement may materially differ from the terms of this Agreement. (c) Successfully complete our then-current training requirements and pay the then-current fee for training. (d) If the proposed transferee is one of our other franchisees, he or she must not be in default under his or her agreements with us and must have a good record of customer service and compliance with our operating standards. (e) If the transferee is a corporation or other entity, the owner or owners of a beneficial interest in the transferee must execute our then-current form of personal guarantee. Page 27 of 39\n\nSource: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n14.3.3. You or the transferee must make arrangements to modernize, upgrade, and conform the Franchised Business, at your and/or the transferee's expense, to our then-current standards and specifications for new Franchised Businesses. 14.3.4. We must be paid, either by you or the transferee, a transfer fee (\"Transfer Fee\") in an amount equal to $7,500 (or twenty- five percent (25%) of the then-current initial franchise fee, if greater). The payment of this transfer fee is in place of any initial franchise fee due under the Franchise Agreement the transferee will enter under Section 14.3.2 [Transfer of Entire Business] above. If the transferee is a spouse, son, or daughter of the transferor and the transfer is for estate-planning purposes, no transfer fee is charged, but the transferor must reimburse us for the out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys' fees) we incur in connection with reviewing, approving, and properly documenting the transfer. 14.3.5. You and all Owners must execute a general release, in a form satisfactory to us, of all claims against us and our past, present and future affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, agents and employees. You and the Owners will remain liable to us for all obligations arising before the effective date of the Transfer. 14.3.6. The price and other proposed terms of the Transfer must not, in our reasonable business judgment, have the effect of negatively impacting the future viability of the Franchised Business. 14.4. Transfer of a Partial Ownership Interest. For any proposal to admit a new Owner, to remove an existing Owner, or to change the distribution of ownership shown on the cover page, or for any other transaction that amounts to the Transfer of a partial interest in the Franchised Business, you must give us advance notice and submit a copy of all proposed contracts and other information concerning the Transfer that we may request. We will have the right to require reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses that we incur in reviewing the proposed Transfer. We will have a reasonable time (not less than thirty (30) days) after we have received all requested information to evaluate the proposed Transfer. You must satisfy the conditions in Sections 8.6, 14.3.2(a) [Transfer of Entire Business], 14.3.4 [Transfer of Entire Business], 14.3.5 [Transfer of Entire Business], and 14.3.6 [Transfer of Entire Business] above in connection with any such transfer. We may withhold our consent on any reasonable grounds or give our consent subject to reasonable conditions. You acknowledge that any proposed new owner must submit a personal application and execute a personal guarantee in the same form signed by the original Owners. 14.5. Transfer to a Corporation or Other Entity. We will consent to the assignment of this Agreement to a corporation, partnership or limited liability corporation that you form for the convenience of ownership, provided that: (a) the entity has and will have no other business besides operating a Franchised Business (b) you satisfy the conditions in Sections 14.3.2(a) [Transfer of Entire Business], 14.3.3 [Transfer of Entire Business], 14.3.4 [Transfer of Entire Business] and 14.3.5 [Transfer of Entire Business] above; and (c) the Owners hold equity interests in the new entity in the same proportion shown on the cover page. There is no Transfer Fee for a Transfer to a corporation for convenience of ownership. 14.6. Transfer upon Death or Incapacity. If you or any Owner dies, becomes incapacitated, or enters bankruptcy proceedings, that person's executor, administrator, personal representative, or trustee must apply to us in writing within three (3) months after the event (death, declaration of incapacity, or filing of a bankruptcy petition) for consent to Transfer the person's interest. The Transfer will be subject to the provisions of Sections 14.2 [No Transfer without Our Prior Written Consent] through 14.8 [Our Right of First Refusal], as applicable, except there will be no Transfer Fee. In addition, if the deceased or incapacitated person is the Operating Principal, you must within 30 days thereafter, hire and retain a replacement, who is satisfactory to us, to perform such obligations. If a satisfactory replacement is not retained, we will have the right (but not the obligation) to take over operation of the Franchised Business, or to hire and retain a replacement on your behalf, until the Transfer is completed and to charge a reasonable management fee for these services. For purposes of this Section, \"incapacity\" means any physical or mental infirmity that will prevent the person from performing his or her obligations under this Agreement: (i) for a period of thirty (30) or more consecutive days; or (ii) for sixty (60) or more total days during a calendar year. In the case of Transfer by bequest or by intestate succession, if the heirs or beneficiaries are unable to meet the conditions of Section 14.3 [Transfer of Entire Business], the executor may transfer the decedent's interest to another successor that we have approved, subject to all of the terms and conditions for Transfers contained in this Agreement. If an interest is not disposed of under this Section 14.6 [Transfer upon Death or Incapacity] within six (6) months after the date of death or appointment of a personal representative or trustee, we may terminate this Agreement under Section 15.2 [Termination By Us Without A Cure Period] below. Page 28 of 39\n\nSource: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n14.7. Non-Conforming Transfers. Any purported Transfer that is not in compliance with this Section 14 is null and void and constitutes a material breach of this Agreement, for which we may terminate this Agreement without opportunity to cure. Our consent to a Transfer does not constitute a waiver of any claims that we have against the transferor, nor is it a waiver of our right to demand exact compliance with the terms of this Agreement. 14.8. Our Right of First Refusal. We have the right, exercisable within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice specified in Section 14.2 [No Transfer without Our Prior Written Consent], to send written notice to you that we intend to purchase the interest proposed to be Transferred. We may assign our right of first refusal to someone else either before or after we exercise it. However, our right of first refusal will not apply with regard to a Transfer under Section 14.5 [Transfer to a Corporation or Other Entity] or a Transfer to your parents, spouse, son, daughter, or mother or father in-law (including Transfers to your parents, spouse, son, daughter, or mother or father in-law as a result of death or incapacity as described in Section 14.6 [Transfer upon Death or Incapacity]). 14.8.1. If the Transfer is proposed to be made pursuant to a sale, we or our designee may purchase the interest proposed to be Transferred on the same economic terms and conditions offered by the third-party. Closing on our purchase must occur by the later of (a) 60 days after the date of our notice to the seller electing to purchase the interest, or (b) the closing date as proposed in the third-party's purchase offer. If we cannot reasonably be expected to furnish the same consideration as the third-party, then we may substitute the reasonable equivalent in cash. If the parties cannot agree within 30 days on the reasonable equivalent in cash, we will designate, at our expense, an independent appraiser and the appraiser's determination will be final. Any material change in the terms of the offer from a third-party after we have elected not to purchase the seller's interest will constitute a new offer subject to the same right of first refusal as the third party's initial offer. 14.8.2. If a Transfer is proposed to be made by gift, we will designate, at our expense, an independent appraiser to determine the fair market value of the interest proposed to be transferred. We may purchase the interest at the fair market value determined by the appraiser. Closing on the purchase will occur within 30 days after our notice to the transferor of the appraiser's determination of fair market value. 14.8.3. If we elect not to exercise our rights under this Section, the transferor may complete the Transfer after complying with Sections 14.2 [No Transfer without Our Prior Written Consent] through 14.6 [Transfer upon Death or Incapacity] above. Closing of the Transfer must occur within 60 calendar days of our election (or such longer period as applicable law may require); otherwise, the third-party's offer will be treated as a new offer subject to our right of first refusal. The Transfer is conditional upon our determination that the Transfer was on terms substantially the same as those offered to us. 15. TERMINATION 15.1. Termination By Us Without Notice. You will be in default under this Agreement and all rights granted by this Agreement will automatically terminate without notice to you if you become insolvent or make an assignment for the benefit of your creditors; if a receiver is appointed; if execution is levied against your business assets; or if suit to foreclose any lien or mortgage or bankruptcy is instituted against you and not dismissed within 60 days.

We may terminate this Agreement by written notice to you, without giving you an opportunity to cure, upon the occurrence of any of the following events: 15.2.1. You, the Operating Principal, and/or your personnel fail to complete training under Section 5.1 [Initial Training Program] to our satisfaction. 15.2.2. You fail to open for business by the opening deadline specified in Appendix A. 15.2.3. You disclose the contents of the Manual or other trade secrets or confidential information contrary to Sections 11 and 12 of this Agreement. 15.2.4. You refuse to permit, or try to hinder, an examination or audit of your books and records or of the Franchised Business as provided in this Agreement. 15.2.5. You make any material misrepresentation in connection with your application to us for the franchise, or you submit to us any report or statement that you know or should know to be false or misleading. 15.2.6. You understate to us your Gross Revenues, by 2% or more on three or more occasions in any twelve-month period, or by 5% or more for any period of four or more consecutive weeks. 15.2.7. You fail to operate the Franchised Business for three or more consecutive business days on which you were required to operate, unless we determine that the failure was beyond your control. 15.2.8. You or any Owner, officer or director is convicted of a crime that we reasonably believe is likely to harm the reputation of the Pizza Fusion concept. 15.2.9. Any Transfer occurs that does not comply with Section 14, including a failure to transfer to a qualified successor after death or disability within the time allowed by Section 14.7 [Non-Conforming Transfers]. 15.2.10. You are in default three (3) or more times under Sections 15.3 [Termination by Us Following Expiration of Cure Period for Monetary Default] and/or 15.4 [Termination by Us Following Expiration of Cure Period] within any twelve (12) month period, whether or not the defaults are similar and whether or not they are cured. 15.2.11. After curing a default pursuant to Sections 15.3 [Termination by Us Following Expiration of Cure Period for Monetary Default] or 15.4 [Termination by Us Following Expiration of Cure Period], you commit the same default within twelve (12) months, whether or not the second default is cured. 15.2.12. Any condition exists with respect to the Franchised Business that, in our reasonable judgment, seriously jeopardizes public health or safety. 15.2.13. You fail to comply with the covenants in Section 17 below or fail to timely obtain execution of the covenants required under Section 12 above and Section 17.3 [Owners and Employees] below. 15.2.14. You fail to obtain or maintain required insurance. 15.2.15. You cease to operate the Franchised Business for more than seven (7) consecutive days or fourteen (14) days in any calendar year unless we approved a temporary closing or we determine, that the failure to operate was beyond your control, you otherwise abandon the Franchised Business, or you lose the right to possess the Premises or you otherwise forfeit the right to do or transact business as required under this Agreement. If, however, through no fault of you, the Premises are damaged or destroyed by an event such that repairs or reconstruction cannot be completed within ninety (90) days thereafter, you will have thirty (30) days after such event in which to apply for our approval to relocate and/or reconstruct the premises, and we will not unreasonably hold our approval. Page 30 of 39\n\nSource: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n15.3. Termination by Us Following Expiration of Cure Period for Monetary Default. You will be in default under this Agreement if you fail, refuse, or neglect to pay when due (including if we are not able to collect payments by electronic fund transfer pursuant to Section 3.6 [Method of Payment] due to insufficient funds in your account(s), closure of your account(s), or any other reason resulting in the nonpayment) any monies owing to us, our affiliates, or any lender that has provided financing to you under this Agreement or any other agreement, or to your landlord and/or any supplier of goods or services to your Franchised Business. You will have ten (10) days after written notice of such default from us within which to remedy the default. You may avoid termination by curing the default to our satisfaction within the 10-day period (or such longer period as applicable law may require). If you do not cure the default within such 10-day period (or such longer period as applicable law may require), this Agreement will terminate automatically and without further notice, effective immediately upon the expiration of the specified time period. 15.4 Termination by Us Following Expiration of Cure Period. For any default not covered under Sections 15.1 [Termination By Us Without Notice], 15.2 [Termination By Us Without A Cure Period], or 15.3 above, you will have thirty (30) days after written notice of default from us within which to remedy the default. You may avoid termination by curing the default to our satisfaction within the 30-day period (or such longer period as applicable law may require). If you do not cure the default within the specified time, this Agreement will terminate automatically and without further notice, effective immediately upon the expiration of the specified time period. Any failure to comply with this Agreement, as amended or reasonably supplemented by the Manual or otherwise in writing, not covered by Sections 15.1 [Termination By Us Without Notice], 15.2 [Termination By Us Without A Cure Period], or 15.3 above constitutes a default, including, but not limited to, the following: 15.3.1. You fail, refuse, or neglect to submit to us the financial and other reports and information required under this Agreement. 15.3.2. You fail to comply with any of the mandatory standards or procedures prescribed by us in this Agreement, the Manual, or otherwise in writing. 15.3.3. You fail, refuse, or neglect to obtain our prior written approval or consent as required by this Agreement (other than a failure to obtain consent to a proposed Transfer, for which we may terminate without a cure period as provided in Section 15.2 [Termination By Us Without A Cure Period]). 15.3.4. For a period of fifteen (15) days, you allow a continued violation of any law, ordinance, rule or regulation of a governmental agency, including the failure to maintain or procure any required licenses, permits, or certifications, in the absence of a good faith dispute over its application or legality and without promptly resorting to an appropriate administrative or judicial forum for relief. 15.3.5. You misuse or make any unauthorized use of the Proprietary Marks or otherwise materially impair our goodwill or rights in the Proprietary Marks. 15.5. Cross-Default. Any default by you (including for this purpose your affiliates) under any other agreement with us will constitute a default under this Agreement, subject to the same provisions for notice and cure, if any, as may be applicable to the default under the other agreement. 16. OBLIGATIONS ON TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION 16.1. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason, unless we direct you otherwise: 16.1.1. You agree to promptly pay all sums owing to us, our affiliates and suppliers, including, but not limited to, Royalty payments, contributions to the Marketing Fund, or other fees, damages, expenses, and attorney's fees incurred as a result of your default. Page 31 of 39\n\nSource: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n16.1.2. You agree to stop making any use of the confidential methods, procedures, and techniques associated with the System. You also agree to immediately deliver to us the Manual and all training materials, marketing materials, records, files, forms, instructions, signs, equipment, correspondence, copies, Customer Data, and other property in your possession or control that contain confidential information (as defined in Section 12) or that bear the Proprietary Marks and you agree not to retain any unauthorized copies of these materials. You also must deliver to us all customer information that you have compiled. 16.1.3. You agree to immediately cease to use, by advertising or in any other manner, the name \"Pizza Fusion,\" all other Proprietary Marks, and all other distinctive forms, slogans, signs, symbols, Websites, domain name, website, e-mail address, and any other identifier (whether or not we have authorized its use) that you used in connection with your operation of the Franchised Business or that are otherwise associated with the Proprietary Marks, System, and/or us. If you subsequently begin to operate another business, you agree that you will not use any reproduction, counterfeit, copy or colorable imitation of the Proprietary Marks that you used either in connection with the Franchised Business or its promotion, which is likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception, or which is likely to dilute our exclusive rights in and to the Proprietary Marks, nor any trade dress or designation of origin or description or representation which falsely suggests or represents an association or connection with us. 16.1.4. You agree to promptly take such action as may be necessary to cancel any assumed name registration or equivalent registration containing the name PIZZA FUSION or any other Proprietary Marks. 16.1.5 You will, at our option, assign to us any interest which you have in the lease or sublease for the Premises. (a) If we do not elect or are unable to exercise our option to acquire, or to acquire the lease or sublease for the Premises, you must make such modifications or alterations to the premises operated hereunder (including, without limitation, the changing of the telephone number) immediately upon termination or expiration of this Agreement as may be necessary to distinguish the appearance of the Premises from that of other Restaurants under the System, and such specific additional changes as we may reasonably request for that purpose. In addition, you must stop making any use of any telephone number and/or any domain name, website, e-mail address, and any other identifier (whether or not we have authorized its use) that you used in connection with your operation of the Franchised Business, and you must promptly execute such documents or take such steps necessary to remove reference to the Franchised Business from all trade or business telephone directories, including physical and online \"yellow\" and \"white\" pages, or at our request transfer same to us. (b) If you fail or refuse to comply with the requirements of this Section 16.1.5 [OBLIGATIONS ON TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION], we will have the right to enter upon the Premises, without being guilty of trespass or any other tort, for the purpose of making or causing to be made such changes as may be required, at your expense, which you agree to pay upon demand. 16.2. Purchase of Assets. You agree that, at our option, you will sell to us any or all your assets used to operate the Franchised Business (including equipment, fixtures, furnishings, Delivery Vehicles, supplies, and inventory) that we ask in writing to purchase. 16.2.1. The purchase price for such items will be equal to your depreciated cost (determined below) or fair market value, whichever is less. The cost will be determined based upon a five (5) year straight-line depreciation of original costs. For equipment that is five (5) or more years old, the parties agree that fair market value will be deemed to be ten percent (10%) of the equipment's original cost. The fair market value of tangible assets must be determined without reference to good will, going-concern value, or other intangible assets. Page 32 of 39\n\nSource: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n16.2.2. We may exercise this option by delivering a notice of intent to purchase to you within 30 days after the expiration or termination of this Agreement. During that 30-day period, you agree not to dispose of, transfer, or otherwise hinder our ability to exercise our rights with respect to your assets. 16.2.3. If we exercise our option to purchase, we may setoff all amounts due to us under this Agreement and the cost of the appraisal (if any), against any payment due to you. 16.2.4. If we do not exercise our rights to purchase your Delivery Vehicle(s), you must immediately make such modifications or alterations to the Delivery Vehicle(s) that may be needed to remove any Proprietary Marks and to otherwise distinguish the appearance of the vehicle(s) from those used by other Restaurants. 16.3. Right to Enter and Continue Operations. In order to preserve the goodwill of the System following termination, we (or our designee) have the right to enter the Premises (without liability to you, your Owners, or otherwise) for the purpose continuing the Franchised Business' operation and maintaining the goodwill of the business. 16.4. Liquidated Damages. If this Agreement is terminated due to your default, you must, upon written demand, pay us a lump-sum payment in an amount calculated as follows: (a) the average of your Royalty fees and Advertising Contributions due for the last 60 months before our delivery of notice of default (or, if lesser, the months you had been operating before our delivery of notice of default), (b) multiplied by the lesser of 60 or the number of months remaining in the term of this Agreement. 16.5. Liquidated Damages. 16.5.1 The payments called for in Section 16.4 [Liquidated Damages] above constitute liquidated damages for causing the premature termination of this Agreement and not a penalty. A precise calculation of the full extent of damages that we will incur if this Agreement terminates because you default cannot be reasonably determined. Nevertheless, the parties agree that the lump-sum payment provided under Section 16.4 [Liquidated Damages] above is reasonable in light of the damages for premature termination that may reasonably be expected to occur in such event. 16.5.2 The amounts contemplated under Section 16.4 [Liquidated Damages] above is not a penalty and is intended by the parties only as a compensatory remedy for past breaches and not as a preventative remedy to deter future breaches. Neither does the sum contemplated in Section 16.4 [Liquidated Damages] above represent a price for the privilege of not performing or its payment represent an alternative manner of performance. Accordingly, as a purely liquidated damage provision, this Section does not preclude, nor is inconsistent with, a court granting us specific performance or any other equitable remedies, such as an injunction, to prevent future breaches. Our rights to liquidated damages and specific performance or any other equitable relief are not mutually exclusive. 16.6. Enforcement Costs. You agree to pay all damages, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, that we incur (even if after the expiration or termination of this Agreement) in enforcing this Section 16 or Section 17.2 [After Termination, Expiration, or Transfer] below. 17. RESTRICTIONS ON COMPETITION 17.1. During Term. You acknowledge that this Agreement will give you access to valuable and confidential information regarding the System, including our business development strategy and the operational, sales, promotional and marketing methods of Franchised Businesses. You agree that during the term of this Agreement, you will not, without our prior written consent, either directly or indirectly through any other person or entity: Page 33 of 39\n\nSource: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n17.1.1. Own, manage, engage in, be employed by, advise, make loans to, consult for, rent or lease to, or have any other interest in any business that (directly or indirectly) operates, or grants franchises or licenses to operate, a restaurant featuring pizza and related food specialties or that offers products or services substantially similar to those then offered by Restaurants (\"Competitive Business\"); 17.1.2. Divert or attempt to divert any business or customer, or potential business or customer, to any Competitive Business; or 17.1.3. Induce any person to leave his or her employment with us. 17.1.4. In any manner interfere with, disturb, disrupt, impair, diminish, or otherwise jeopardize our business or that of any of our franchisees. 17.2. After Termination, Expiration, or Transfer. For two (2) years after the expiration or termination of this Agreement or an approved Transfer to a new franchisee, you may not directly or indirectly own, manage, engage in, be employed by, advise, make loans to, consult for, or have any other interest in any Competitive Business that is, or intends to operate, within three (3) mile radius of the Premises of your Franchised Business or within a three (3) mile radius of any Restaurant then-operating or under construction to operate under the System, except as permitted by any Franchise Agreements that remain in effect between you and us. . 17.3. Owners and Employees. The Owners agree that they will personally bind themselves to this Section 17 by signing this Agreement or the attached Guaranty. With respect to the Owners, the time period in Section 17.2 [After Termination, Expiration, or Transfer] will run from the expiration, termination, or Transfer of this Agreement or from the termination of the Owner's relationship with you, whichever occurs first. You must also require and obtain execution of covenants similar to those set forth in Section 12 above, and this Section 17 (as modified to apply to an individual), from any or all of the following persons: your officers, directors, and their respective spouses and employees. (These persons and the Owners are each a \"Restricted Party\") The covenants required by this Section 17.3 [Owners and Employees] shall be in the form provided in Appendix C to this Agreement. Failure by Franchisee to obtain execution of a covenant required by this Section 17.3 [Owners and Employees] shall constitute a default under Section 15.2.13 [Termination By Us Without A Cure Period] above. 17.4. Indirect Violations Prohibited. You may not attempt to circumvent the restrictions in Sections 17.1 [During Term] and 17.2 [After Termination, Expiration, or Transfer] by engaging in prohibited activity indirectly through any other person or entity. 17.5. Enforcement. You agree that the existence of any claim you may have against us, whether or not arising from this Agreement, will not constitute a defense to our enforcement of this Section 17. You agree to pay all costs and expenses that we reasonably incur in enforcing this Section 17, including reasonable attorneys' fees. You acknowledge that a violation of the terms of this Section 17 would result in irreparable injury to us for which no adequate remedy at law may be available. Accordingly, you consent to the issuance of an injunction prohibiting any conduct in violation of the terms of this Section 17. Such injunctive relief will be in addition to any other remedies that we may have. 18. RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES This Agreement does not create a fiduciary or other special relationship or make you or us an agent, legal representative, joint venturer, partner, employee, or servant of each other for any purpose. You are not authorized to, and agree that you will not, make any contract, agreement, warranty, or representation on our behalf, or create any obligation, express or implied, on our behalf. During the term of this Agreement, you agree to hold yourself out to the public as an independent contractor operating the Franchised Business under license from us, and you agree to disclose your status as independent contractor in all business dealings and exhibit a notice to that effect (the location and content of which we reserve the right to specify) on all promotional materials, invoices and stationery.

INDEMNIFICATION You agree to hold harmless, defend, and indemnify us and our past, present and future affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, agents, attorneys, consultants, and employees against any claims, losses, costs, expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, costs of investigation, settlement costs, and interest), liabilities and damages (collectively, \"Claims\") arising directly or indirectly from, as a result of, or in connection with your activities under this Agreement. With respect to any threatened or actual litigation, proceeding, or dispute that could directly or indirectly affect us or any of the other indemnitees under this Section, if you do not assume the active defense of the matter within a reasonable time, we will have the right, but not the obligation, to: (i) choose counsel; (ii) direct and control the handling of the matter; and (iii) settle any claim against the indemnitees. This Section will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, and applies to Claims even if they exceed the limits of your insurance coverage. 20. CONSENTS AND WAIVERS 20.1. Consent. Whenever our prior written consent is required under this Agreement, you agree to make a timely written request to us for such consent. Our approval or consent must be in writing and signed by an authorized officer to be effective. 20.2. Waivers. No delay or failure to exercise any right under this Agreement or to insist upon your strict compliance with any obligation or condition, and no custom or practice that differs from the terms of this Agreement, will constitute a waiver of our right to exercise the contract provision or to demand your strict compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Our waiver of any particular default does not affect or impair our rights with respect to any subsequent default you may commit. Our waiver of a default by another franchisee does not affect or impair our right to demand your strict compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Our acceptance of any payments due from you does not waive any prior defaults. 21. NOTICES Notices related to this Agreement must be in writing and personally delivered, sent by registered mail, or by other means which affords the sender evidence of delivery, or of rejected delivery, to the respective parties. Any notice by a means that affords the sender evidence of delivery, or rejected delivery, shall be deemed to have been given at the date and time of receipt or rejected delivery. We will send notices intended for you to your address on the first page of this Agreement. You agree to send notices intended for us to our principal business address, which is currently 2200 West Cypress Creek Road, 1st Floor, Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33309. Either party can change its notice address by informing the other party in writing of a new address. 22. ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND AMENDMENTS This Agreement and the documents referred to herein constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the Franchised Business and supersede all prior negotiations, representations, correspondence, and agreements concerning the same subject matter. However, nothing in this Agreement is meant to disclaim any representation that we make in the Franchise Disclosure Document that we have given to you. Any amendment to this Agreement will not be binding on either party unless that amendment is writing and signed by both parties.

Each provision of this Agreement is severable from the others. If, for any reason, any provision is determined by a court to be invalid, the invalidity will not impair the operation of the remaining provisions of this Agreement. The latter will continue to be given full force and effect and bind us and you. 23.2. Survival of Clauses. Each provision of this Agreement that expressly or by reasonable implication is to be performed, in whole or in part, after the expiration, termination, or Transfer of this Agreement will survive such expiration, termination, or Transfer. 23.3 Force Majeure. If the performance of any obligation by any party under this Agreement is prevented, hindered or delayed by reason of Force Majeure, which cannot be overcome by reasonable commercial measures, then the parties shall be relieved of their respective obligations (but only to the extent, that the parties, having exercised best efforts, are prevented, hindered or delayed in such performance) during the period of such Force Majeure. The party whose performance is affected by an event of Force Majeure shall give prompt written notice in the circumstances of such Force Majeure event to the other party by describing the nature of the event and an estimate as to its duration, if possible. As used in this Agreement, the term \"Force Majeure\" means any act of God, strike, lock out or other industrial disturbance, terrorist act, war (declared or undeclared), riot, epidemic, fire or other catastrophe, or act of any government. However, your inability to obtain financing or make payments (regardless of the reason) does not constitute \"Force Majeure.\" 23.4 Cover Page, Recitals, and Captions. The parties agree to incorporate by reference, and include in the text of this Agreement, the information on the cover page and in the recital paragraphs. The parties also agree that all of the captions in this Agreement are meant only for the convenience of the parties, and none of the captions shall be deemed to affect the meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement. 23.5 No Third Party Rights. Except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement is intended (nor shall be deemed) to confer upon any party any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement, except for you, us, and such of our respective successors and assigns as may be contemplated (and, as to you, permitted) by Sections 13 and 14 above. 24. GOVERNING LAW This Agreement and the relationship between the parties is governed by and will be construed exclusively in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida (without regard to, and without applying, Florida conflict-of-law rules). 25. DISPUTES 25.1. Submission to Mediation. Except as otherwise provided in Section 25.7 [Remedies Not Exclusive] below, any controversy or claim arising between us will first be submitted to non-binding mediation administered by an established, neutral mediation service with experience in franchise disputes. Both parties must sign a confidentiality agreement before participating in any mediation proceeding. The mediation will take place in the city where our principal offices are located at the time the demand for mediation is filed. Once either party has submitted a dispute to mediation, the obligation to attend will be binding on both parties. Each party will bear its own costs with respect to the mediation. The fee for the mediation, however, will be split equally. 25.2. Forum for Litigation. You and the Owners must file any suit against us, and we may file any suit against you, in the federal or state court where our principal office is located at the time the suit is filed. The parties waive all questions of personal jurisdiction and venue for the purpose of carrying out this provision. Page 36 of 39\n\nSource: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n25.3. Mutual Waiver of Class Actions. Any lawsuit, claim, counterclaim, or other action may be conducted only on an individual basis, and not as part of a consolidated, common, or class action. 25.4. Mutual Waiver of Jury Trial. You and we each irrevocably waive trial by jury in any litigation. 25.5. Mutual Waiver of Punitive Damages. Each of us waives any right to or claim of punitive, exemplary, multiple, or consequential damages against the other in litigation and agrees to be limited to the recovery of actual damages sustained. 25.6 Time Period to Bring Claims. Any and all claims and actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the relationship between you and us, or your operation of the Restaurant, brought by any party hereto against the other, must be commenced within one (1) year from the occurrence of the facts giving rise to such claim or action, or, it is expressly acknowledged and agreed by all parties, such claim or action will be irrevocably barred. 25.7. Remedies Not Exclusive. Except as provided in Sections 25.1 [Submission to Mediation] through 25.4 [Mutual Waiver of Jury Trial] above, no right or remedy that the parties have under this Agreement is exclusive of any other right or remedy under this Agreement or under applicable law. 25.8. Our Right to Injunctive Relief. Nothing in this Agreement bars our right to obtain injunctive or declaratory relief against a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement that will cause us loss or damage. You agree that we will not be required to prove actual damages or post a bond or other security in seeking or obtaining injunctive relief (both preliminary and permanent) and/or specific performance. 25.9. Attorneys Fees and Costs. You agree to reimburse us for all expenses we reasonably incur (including attorneys' fees): (a) to enforce the terms of this Agreement or any obligation owed to us by you and/or the Owners; and (b) in the defense of any claim you and/or the Owners assert against us upon which we substantially prevail in court, arbitration, mediation, or other formal legal proceedings. 26. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 26.1. Independent Investigation. You and the Owners acknowledge that: 26.1.1. You have conducted an independent investigation of the business venture contemplated by this Agreement and recognize that it involves business risks and that your results will be largely dependent upon your own efforts and ability; 26.1.2. We expressly disclaim the making of, and you acknowledge that you have not received, any representation, express or implied, as to the potential volume, profits or success of the business venture contemplated by this Agreement; 26.1.3.

You must seek or obtain advice of counsel specifically with respect to this issue. 26.2. Receipt of Documents. You acknowledge that you received a copy of this Agreement, the exhibit(s) hereto, and agreements relating hereto, if any, with all of the blank lines therein filled in, at least seven (7) days before the date when this Agreement was signed, and with sufficient time within which to review the Agreement, with advisors of your choosing.

No Conflicting Obligations. Each party represents and warrants to the others that there are no other agreements, court orders, or any other legal obligations that would preclude or in any manner restrict such party from: (a) negotiating and entering into this Agreement; (b) exercising its rights under this Agreement; and/or (c) fulfilling its responsibilities under this Agreement.

The warranty shall not apply only if:\n\n     (a)     the Software and MarketSite.net Service has been not properly                 installed and used at all times and in accordance with the                 Documentation; and\n\n     (b)     Corio has requested modifications, alterations or additions to                 the Software and MarketSite.net Service that cause it to deviate                 from the Documentation.\n\n7.4     Product Warranty - Year 2000 Compliance. Commerce One warrants that the         Software and MarketSite.net Service, when used in accordance with its         associated documentation, is in all material respects capable upon         installation of accurately processing, providing and/or receiving date         data from, into and between the twentieth and twenty-first centuries,         including the years 1999 and 2000, and leap year calculations; provided         that all licensee and third party equipment, systems, hardware, software         and firmware used in combination with the Software and MarketSite.net         Service properly exchange date data with the Software and MarketSite.net         Service\n\n                                     8\n\n9         OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF         MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n8       INDEMNIFICATION.\n\n8.1     By Commerce One. Commerce One shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless         Corio and its Customers from any and all damages, liabilities, costs and         expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Corio or its         Customers arising out of any claim that the Software infringes any         patent, copyright, trademark or trade right secret of a third party;         provided that Corio or its Customer promptly notifies Commerce One in         writing of any such claim and promptly tenders the control and the         defense and settlement of any such claim to Commerce One at Commerce         One's expense and with Commerce One's choice of counsel. Corio or its         Customer shall cooperate with Commerce One, at Commerce One's expense,         in defending or settling such claim and Corio or its Customer may join         in defense with counsel of its choice at its own expense. If the         Software is, or in the opinion of Commerce One may become, the subject         of any claim of infringement or if it is adjudicatively determined that         the Software infringes, then Commerce One may, at its sole option and         expense, either (i) procure for Corio the right from such third party to         use the Software, (ii) replace or modify the Software with other         suitable and substantially equivalent products so that the Software         becomes noninfringing, or if (i) and (ii) are not practicable after         Commerce One has exhausted all diligent efforts, (iii) terminate this\n\n\n\n\n\n     Agreement and refund to Corio a pro-rated portion of the fees paid         hereunder.\n\n8.2     Limitations. Commerce One shall have no liability for any infringement         based on (i) the use of the Software other than as set forth in the         Documentation; or (ii) the modification of the Software by a party other         than Commerce One, when such infringement would not have occurred but         for such modification.\n\n9       LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n     EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY ARISING UNDER SECTION 8 OF THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO         EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR         THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT ACTUALLY         PAID BY CORIO HEREUNDER FOR THE TRANSACTION WHICH THE LIABILITY RELATES         TO DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE FILING OF THE         CAUSE OF ACTION TO WHICH THE LIABILITY RELATES. EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY         ARISING UNDER SECTION 8 OF THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER         PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR         COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY         INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY         THEORY OF LIABILITY AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF         THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS SECTION 9         REPRESENTS A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK.\n\n                                     9\n\n10         LIABILITY RELATES. EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY ARISING UNDER SECTION 8 OF THIS         AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE         OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE         GOODS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES         HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH         PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. THE PARTIES         AGREE THAT THIS SECTION 9 REPRESENTS A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK.\n\n10      CONFIDENTIALITY.\n\n     Each party hereby agrees that it shall not use any Confidential         Information received from the other party other than as expressly         permitted under the terms of a non-disclosure agreement to be         concurrently executed with this Agreement.\n\n11      TERM AND TERMINATION.\n\n11.1    Term. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date         and shall continue in full force and effect for an initial period of         five (5) years. Thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically renew for         subsequent one (1) year periods unless either party provides the other         party with written notification at least thirty (30) days prior to the         expiration of the initial five (5) year term or any one (1) year renewal         thereof of its intention to terminate this Agreement.\n\n11.2    Termination. If either party materially breaches any term or condition         of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within-thirty (30) days         after receiving written notice of the breach, the nonbreaching party may         terminate this Agreement on written notice at any time following the end         of such-thirty (30) day period. This Agreement shall terminate         immediately upon notice if either party becomes insolvent (i.e., becomes         unable to pay its debts in the ordinary course of business as they come         due) or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors. Compliance by         the Software with the Software's specifications after expiration of the         Warranty Period shall be deemed a material condition of this Agreement.\n\n11.3    Effect of Termination. The following Sections shall survive the         termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason: 4.2, 5.3, 7,         8, 9, 10, 12 and 14. Corio's right to allow its then-existing Customers         and their Software Users to use and access the Software in accordance         with Section 2 of this Agreement and all payment obligations related         thereto shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.         Commerce One's obligation to provide Software support and maintenance to         Corio and its Customers shall survive any termination or expiration of         this Agreement, provided Corio continues to make its annual support and         maintenance payments as specified in this Agreement. Upon termination or         expiration of this Agreement, each party shall otherwise return or         destroy any Confidential Information of the other party provided,         however, Corio may retain any Confidential Information necessary for         Corio to continue supporting it's then-existing Customers.\n\n12      SOURCE CODE ESCROW.\n\n12.1    Escrow Account. Within sixty (60) days of the Effective Date, Commerce         One agrees to execute an escrow agreement by and among Corio, Commerce         One and a mutually acceptable escrow agent (the \"ESCROW AGENT\"). The         Escrow Agent shall require Commerce One to place in an\n\n                                    10\n\n11         escrow account in California a copy of the source code of the Software\n\n\n\n\n\n     including all Updates and Upgrades thereto, documentation and similar         materials (the SOURCE CODE). The escrow agreement shall contain, at a         minimum, the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 12. Corio         shall bear all fees, expenses and other charges to open and maintain         such escrow account. If a Release Condition (as defined in Section 12.2         of this Agreement) occurs and the Escrow Agent provides the Source Code         to Corio under the escrow agreement, Corio agrees to hold the Source         Code in confidence pursuant to the provisions contained in Section 10 of         this Agreement, and not to use them for any purpose other than those         purposes contemplated under Section 12.3 of this Agreement.\n\n12.2    Release. Corio shall notify Commerce One in writing if it believes that         one of the following events (the \"RELEASE CONDITIONS\") has occurred and         that it intends to seek release of the Source Code from the escrow         account: (i) Commerce One's dissolution or ceasing to do business in the         normal course, or (ii) Commerce One's repeated and material breach of         its support and maintenance obligations under Section 5 of this         Agreement and such breach is not cured within sixty (60) days of receipt         of written notice thereof from Corio. If Commerce One notifies Corio in         writing that it disputes whether any such event has occurred, officers         of each of the parties shall negotiate for a period of ten (10) business         days to attempt to resolve the dispute. At the end of such ten (10)         business day period, if the parties have not resolved the dispute, the         matter shall be referred to arbitration in the manner provided in         Section 14.3 of this Agreement.\n\n12.3    License. Upon the release of the Source Code to Corio pursuant to         Section 12.2 of this Agreement, Corio shall have a royalty-free,         nonexclusive, nontransferable, right and license in the Territory to use         and modify the Source Code to support and maintain the Software until         the expiration or termination of Corio's Customers' End User License         Agreements. The object code derived from the Source Code so modified         shall be subject to the same rights and restrictions on use,         reproduction and disclosure that are contained in this Agreement with         respect to the Software. Corio shall not distribute, sell or sublicense         the Source Code. Subject to the licenses expressly granted in this         Agreement, Commerce One shall retain all right, title and interest in         and to the Source Code. This license shall be deemed to extend worldwide         in scope if Corio, at the time one or more Release Conditions has         occurred, has been granted worldwide license rights by Commerce One         under Section 2 of this Agreement.\n\n13      SHARED RESOURCES.\n\n13.1    Operations. To the extent not provided for within the Statement of Work         covered by the Implementation Fee, Commerce One shall provide Corio with         access to Commerce One operations personnel as reasonably requested by         Corio, subject to payment by Corio of Commerce One's standard fees [*].         These Commerce One operations personnel shall work together with Corio         personnel to optimize the architecture and performance of the Software         and MarketSite.net Service in a hosted environment. Commerce One shall         only commit personnel with expertise in installations, operating         environments and networking functionality.\n\n13.2    Consulting. To the extent not provided for within the Statement of Work         covered by the Implementation Fee, Commerce One shall provide Corio with         access to Commerce One consulting personnel as reasonably requested by         Corio, subject to payment by Corio of Commerce One's standard fees [*].

Commerce One may, in its sole but         reasonable discretion, elect to assign resources from a third party         systems integrator subject to advance notification to Corio of such         election.\n\n13.3    Engineering. Commerce One shall provide Corio with reasonable access to         Commerce One engineering personnel at no additional cost to Corio. Joint         engineering work may include product development, including without         limitation, technical and functional application development and         integration.\n\n13.4    Other. All services provided hereunder, in addition to services         subsequently requested by Corio (e.g. customization of the Software)         shall be subject to the terms of a separate agreement between the         parties.\n\n13.5    Ownership. Subject to Commerce One's pre-existing ownership of any         materials or technology provided to Corio, the results of all such         development efforts set forth in this Section 13, including all         intellectual property rights in any software interface coding or         programs created solely by Corio during the term of this Agreement to         enable the Software to operated within the Corio Servers' hosted         environment (\"DEVELOPMENTS\"), shall be owned by Corio, unless such         Developments are supported on an ongoing basis by Commerce One in which         case Commerce One will retain all ownership rights, including\n\n\n\n\n\n     intellectual property rights in the Developments. To the extent that         Commerce One would otherwise have a claim of ownership in such         Developments, Commerce One hereby assigns all rights in and to such         Developments to Corio. Further, Commerce One represents and warrants         that all Commerce One employees, agents, contractors or consultants that         will be provided to work together with Corio have or will have signed         agreements with customary terms containing confidentiality provisions         and assignment of inventions (\"EMPLOYEE NDA/INVENTION AGREEMENT\"). Corio         covenants and warrants that it will not disclose to Commerce One or its         officers, directors, employees, agents, contractors or consultants any         proprietary information, including without limitation any technical         information related to Developments created solely by Corio under this         Agreement, except upon the written authorization to do so by a Corporate         Officer of Commerce One. Commerce One covenants that during the term of         this Agreement, it will continue to require all Commerce One employees,         agents, contractors or consultants to sign an Employee NDA/Invention         Agreement and that Commerce One will furnish to Corio copies of such         signed agreements upon Corio's request. Ownership of intellectual         property rights to any enhancements, modifications or derivative works         to the Software itself which may be developed jointly by the parties or         solely by Corio shall be negotiated by the parties prior to the start of         any such development work.\n\n13.6    Independent Development: Covenant not to Sue. Nothing in this Agreement         will be construed to prohibit either parties' right to independently         develop the Developments contemplated above. Each party covenants that         it shall not, under any circumstances, sue the other party (or its         officers, directors, successors and assigns) or any of that parties'         licensees, customers, or distributors (\"Protected Entities\") for patent         infringment under any future patents or future patent rights relating to         said Developments, that either party owns or controls, so long as that         Protected Entity has a license from Commerce One or Corio to the         Software, or to a product that is a modification of, derivative work         based on, or replacement for the Software. The foregoing covenant is         binding on Corio's permitted successors and assigns, and inures to the         benefit of any\n\n                                    12\n\n13         of Commerce One's successors and assigns, and is binding on Commerce         One's permitted successors and assigns, and inures to the benefit of any         of Corio's successors and assigns.\n\n14      MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n14.1    Assignment. Neither party may assign this Agreement or any rights or         obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without         the prior written consent of the other party. Notwithstanding the         foregoing, either party shall have the right to assign this Agreement in         connection with the merger or acquisition of such party or the sale of         all or substantially all of its assets related to this Agreement without         such consent, except in the case where such transaction involves a         direct competitor of the other party where consent of the other party         will be required. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind and         inure to the benefit of the parties, their respective successors and         permitted assigns. Any assignment in violation of this Section 14.1         shall be null and void.\n\n14.2    Waiver and Amendment. No modification, amendment or waiver of any         provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and         signed by the party to be charged. No failure or delay by either party         in exercising any right, power, or remedy under this Agreement, except         as specifically provided herein, shall operate as a waiver of any such         right, power or remedy.\n\n14.3    Choice of Law; Arbitration; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by         the laws of the State of California, USA, excluding conflict of laws         provisions and excluding the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts         for the International Sale of Goods.

The arbitration shall be conducted by         one (1) arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Rules in San         Francisco County, California. A judgment upon the award may be entered         in any court having jurisdiction of the parties, including without         limitation the courts in San Francisco, California. The non-prevailing         party in the arbitration shall pay all fees and charges of the American         Arbitration Association; each party, however, shall be responsible for         the payment of all fees and expenses connected with the presentation of         its respective case.\n\n14.4    Notices. All notices, demands or consents required or permitted under         this Agreement shall be in writing. Notice shall be considered delivered         and effective on the earlier of actual receipt or when (a) personally         delivered; (b) the day following transmission if sent by telex, telegram         or facsimile followed by written confirmation by registered overnight         carrier or certified United States mail; or (c) one (1) day after         posting when sent by registered private overnight carrier (e.g., DHL,         Federal Express, etc.); or (d) five (5) days after posting when sent by         certified United States mail. Notice shall be sent to the parties at the         addresses set forth on the first page of this Agreement or at such other         address as shall be specified by either party to the other in writing.\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5    Independent Contractors. The parties are independent contractors with         respect to each other. Each party is not and shall not be deemed to be         an employee, agent, partner or legal representative of the other for any         purpose and shall not have any right, power or authority to create any         obligation or responsibility on behalf of the other.\n\n14.6    Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of         competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such provision shall be         changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the\n\n                                    13\n\n14         objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent allowed by         law and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full         force and effect.\n\n14.7    Force Majeure. Neither party shall be deemed to be in breach of this         agreement for any failure or delay in performance caused by reasons         beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God,         earthquakes, strikes or shortages of materials.\n\n14.8    Subcontract. Commerce One understands and agrees that Corio shall solely         direct the provision of Corio Services and may subcontract certain         portions of the Corio Services to third parties at any time during the         term of the Agreement.\n\n14.9    Bankruptcy. The parties hereto agree that Corio, as a licensee of         Commerce One's intellectual property, shall be afforded all of the         protections afforded to a licensee under Section 365(n) of the United         States Bankruptcy Code, as amended from time to time (the \"CODE\") so         that the Trustee or Debtor in Possession, as defined in the Code, will         not interfere with Corio's license with respect to the Software as         provided in this Agreement, as set forth in Section 365(n) of the Code.\n\n14.10   Complete Understanding. This Agreement including all Exhibits, and the         Non Disclosure Agreement and the Statement of Work referenced in this         Agreement and incorporated by reference herein, constitutes the final,         complete and exclusive agreement between the parties with respect to the         subject matter hereof, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous         agreement.

The portions of the Agreement for which confidential treatment has been requested are marked with X's in brackets and such confidential portions have been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n                              PROMOTION AGREEMENT\n\nThis Promotion Agreement (the \"Agreement\") is dated as of January 26, 1998 between CNET, Inc. (\"CNET\") and Cyberian Outpost, Inc. (the \"Company\"). Pursuant to this Agreement, CNET will provide various links and other online and television promotions (collectively, the \"Promotions\") to the Company to assist the Company in promoting its products and services and facilitating the sale of products to potential buyers through its Internet site. CNET will be compensated by the Company for providing the Promotions. Accordingly, the parties hereby agree as follows:\n\n1.   Background.\n\n     1.1  The Company. The Company operates an electronic retailing operation           through its Internet sites located at www.cyberianoutpost.com or           www.outpost.com (together with any successors to such sites, the           \"Company Site\"). Through the Company Site, the Company sells or           facilitates the sale of various products and services, either directly           or as an agent for third party vendors. All products and services           offered for sale through the Company Site are referred to as the           \"Products.\"\n\n     1.2  CNET. CNET produces television programs and operates a network of           Internet sites on the world wide web. For purposes of this Agreement,           the \"CNET Sites\" refer to any Internet sites operated by CNET or its           subsidiaries, including without limitation the sites referenced in           Section 2.5 and Exhibit A.\n\n2.   CNET's Obligations.\n\n     2.1  TV Promotions. CNET will provide the Company one 15 second \"spot\" for           Promotions on its syndicated weekly TV program, TV.COM. Promotions           will run on each weekly episode of TV.COM during the Term; provided           that TV.COM remains on the air throughout such period. Should TV.COM           not be run on the air during a portion of the Term, CNET will run two           download.com banner advertising programs per month during such portion           of the Term in lieu of the foregoing TV.COM Promotions.\n\n     2.2  Banner Promotions. CNET will provide advertising banners to the           Company during the Term as described in Exhibit A.\n\n     2.3  Retail Promotions.\n\n            2.3.1  CNET will provide for various retail Promotions across the CNET                  Sites, which may include text/HTML links, buttons, portals and                  other fixed Promotions that include embedded links to the                  Company Site (the \"Retail Promotions\" and, together with the                  advertising banners contemplated in the preceding paragraph,                  the \"Online Promotions\").\n\n          2.3.2  Subject to Section 4 below, CNET will provide the Company with                  a total of at least (a) [XXXXXX] Retail Impressions during                  the first three months of the Term, (b) [XXXXXX] Retail                  Impressions during the second three months of the Term, (c)                  [XXXXXX] Retail Impressions during the third three months                  of the Term, and (d) [XXXXXX] Retail Impressions during                  the fourth three months of the Term. For such purposes, a                  \"Retail Impression\" means the display of one page of a CNET                  Site that contains at least one Retail Promotion. If CNET fails                  to provide the Retail Impressions required by the preceding                  sentence during the Term, then CNET will continue to display                  Retail Impressions in accordance with this Agreement following                  the Term (notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the                  Term) until the required number of Retail Impressions has been                  delivered.\n\n     2.4  Placement of Retail Promotions. CNET will determine the location and           type of each Retail Promotion displayed throughout the CNET Sites and           may phase in certain types of Retail Promotions as they are developed.           CNET currently intends to display Retail Promotions consisting of           text/HTML links, pre-filled with an appropriate query string or link           (\"Pre-Filled Links\"), as set forth in this Section. The Retail           Promotions contemplated by this Section will be displayed above the           fold where the graphical layout of the page reasonably permits such           positioning (as determined by CNET), and in other cases the Retail           Promotions will be prominently positioned below the fold. For the           purposes of clarity, the \"fold\" is defined as the visible portion of           the screen on a standard 640 x 480 screen size.\n\n          2.4.1  On SEARCH.COM, CNET intends to display a Pre-Filled Link on the\n\n\n\n\n\n                 search query page related to Shopping and on every search                  results page served by CNET.\n\n          2.4.2  On CNET.COM, CNET intends to display a Pre-Filled Link on pages                  within the site except the Front Door and except for pages                  within the Personalities and Community sections.\n\n          2.4.3  On BUILDER.COM, CNET intends to display a Pre-Filled Link on                  pages within the site except the Front Door and the \"Builder                  Buzz\" section.\n\n            2.4.4  On GAMECENTER.COM, NEWS.COM, DOWNLOAD.COM and SHAREWARE.COM,                  CNET will display a Pre-Filled Link on pages within the site                  except the Front Door.\n\n          2.4.5  Other pages of the CNET Sites, CNET will display additional                  Retail Promotions as appropriate and as mutually agreed upon.\n\n     2.5  Design and Production of Online Promotions. The Company will design           any graphics required for the Online Promotions and provide pre-filled           query strings or links for all of the Pre-Filled Links, with           reasonable assistance from CNET, and the Company will supply digital           copies of such graphics and other materials to CNET. CNET will be           responsible for incorporating the Online Promotions into the CNET           Sites and for ensuring that the Online Promotions are accessible to           users of the CNET Sites (\"Users\").\n\n     2.6  Reporting. Within 30 days after the end of each month during the Term,           CNET will provide a report to the Company indicating the number of           Retail Promotions displayed on the CNET Sites during such month and           the number of times that a User clicked on a Retail Promotion during           such month. CNET will also provide standard reporting for banner           advertisements and television Promotions.\n\n3.   The Company's Obligations:\n\n     3.1  Operation of Company Site. The Company will be responsible for           ensuring that each link embedded within an Online Promotion takes the           User to the appropriate area within the Company Site, and that the           Company Site functions with reasonable reliability and in a           commercially reasonable manner throughout the Term. In particular, the           Company agrees that the Company Site will comply with the performance           standards set forth in Exhibit B throughout the Term. Any failure by           the Company to comply with this paragraph will be deemed to be a           material breach of this Agreement.\n\n     3.2  Reporting. Within 30 days after the end of each month during the Term,           the Company will provide a report to CNET indicating the aggregate           number of referrals from the CNET Sites to the Company Site during           such month, the resulting number of buyers, the aggregate behavior           (including orders and sales volume) of those buyers, and the total           revenue attributable to the Online Promotions minus applicable sales           tax, shipping costs, returns and cancellations (the \"CNET Sales\"). The           \"CNET Sales\" will be counted as sales by the Company to each User who           accesses the Company Site through a link from an Online Promotion for           a period of 4 hours from the referral, CNET and The Company will agree           on technical procedures to allow the easy and accurate reporting of           CNET Sales. The Company will make this information available in a           manner which\n\n            allows CNET and the Company to understand the performance of the           various Online Promotions.\n\n     3.3  Cash Consideration.\n\n          3.3.1  For each month during the Term, the Company will pay CNET a                  minimum of [XXXX] in cash, plus [XXX] of CNET Sales. Payments                  under this paragraph will be based on the reports prepared by                  the Company under Section 3.2 (although CNET may challenge such                  reports as contemplated by Section 9.5) and will be due within                  30 days after the end of each month of the Term.\n\n          3.3.2  Payments under this Section 3.3 will be made by wire transfer                  of immediately available funds and are nonrefundable once paid.\n\n     3.4  User Information. At least once each calendar quarter, the Company           will deliver to CNET all aggregate data collected as a result of the           CNET Sales, including but not limited to, demographic data, buying           behavior as measured by conversion to sale, frequency of purchasing,           average order size, and a comparison to the respective average for the           Company.\n\n     3.5  Reciprocal Marketing. For the duration of the Term, the Company will           place a link within the Beta Report Newsletter, the Cyberian Express           Newsletter, the Gamer's Express newsletter, or any newsletter to which           users can subscribe to which is provided by the Company to its users           (expressly excluded from this obligation are emails that are sent by           the Company for product announcements, or personalized emails sent to           users upon product purchase. This link will be a text phrase or series           of text phrases encouraging the users to sign up for CNET's free email           newsletters for technology News, CNET Dispatch, and Software &           Hardware Services. CNET will provide all entry forms and operate the           production and sending of the newsletter. CNET agrees not to           specifically target these subscribers separately from the general\n\n\n\n\n\n          database of subscribers to CNET's various newsletters. Should the           Company provide a persistent link or series of links (as distinguished           from occasional and ad hoc links to product reviews either on the           Company Site or in any communication by the Company to its customers)           to a \"Technology Content Provider\", CNET shall be given at least equal           prominence to any other Technology Content Provider provided that CNET           offers comparable editorial content. A Technology Content Provider is           defined as a company providing news product information or reviews           about technology products that is not a manufacturer of those           products.\n\n4.   Term and Termination. The term of this Agreement (the \"Term\") will begin on      February 1, 1998 and end on the first anniversary of the date of this      Agreement; provided that (a) either party may terminate this Agreement,      effective at any time after the first three\n\n       months of the Term, by giving 30 days' written notice of termination to the      other party, and (b) either party may terminate this Agreement at any time      by giving written notice of termination to the other party, if the other      party commits a material breach of its obligations hereunder that is not      cured within 30 days after notice thereof from the non-breaching party. If      this Agreement is terminated during any of the three month periods      referenced in Section 2.3.2, then the required number of Retail Impressions      applicable thereunder to such three month period will be pro rated      accordingly.\n\n5.   Exclusivity. For purposes of this agreement \"Competing Computer Products      Retailer\" means any company other than the Company that is engaged in the      retail sale of computer products, with the exception of CNET Direct, which      operates BuyDirect.com. During the Term, CNET will not enter into more than      two other agreements under which CNET receives consideration from a      Competing Computer Products Retailer for displaying permanent links to or      other fixed promotions for such Competing Computer Products Retailer on any      CNET Site; provided that the foregoing will not restrict the display of(a)      standard advertisements for any Competing Computer Products Retailer or its      products or (b) any promotions within COMPUTERS.COM or within CNET's Snap!      Online service (which are expressly excluded from this provision). The      parties acknowledge that the foregoing will not prevent CNET from      displaying text links and other references to Competing Computer Products      Retailers as reasonably necessary to provide appropriate editorial and      search related services on the CNET Sites. The Retail Promotions granted to      the Company shall be placed in such a way as to provide no more or less      prominence to the Company than is provided to any other Competing Computer      Retailer signing an agreement with CNET.\n\n6.  Trademark Licenses.\n\n     6.1  The Company hereby grants to CNET a non-exclusive, royalty-free           license, effective throughout the Term, to use, display and publish           any of the Company trademarks, tradenames, service marks and logos           that may be delivered by the Company to CNET expressly for inclusion           in the Promotions, solely for use in connection with the Promotions.           Any use of the Company Marks by CNET must comply with any reasonable           usage guidelines communicated by the Company to CNET from time to           time. Nothing contained in this Agreement will give CNET any right,           title or interest in or to the Company Marks or the goodwill           associated therewith, except for the limited usage rights expressly           provided above. CNET acknowledges and agrees that, as between the           Company and CNET, the Company is the sole owner of all rights in and           to the Company Marks.\n\n     6.2  The Company hereby represents and warrants to CNET that the Company           has, and will have throughout the Term, all necessary rights in and to           the Company Marks to grant CNET the licenses and usage rights           contemplated by this Agreement without violating the rights of any           third party.\n\n  7.   Responsibility for the Company Products. The Company acknowledges and      agrees that, as between the Company and CNET, the Company will be solely      responsible for any claims or other losses associated with or resulting      from the marketing or operation of the Company Site or the offer or sale of      any Products by the Company or through the Company Site. CNET is not      authorized to make, and agrees not to make, any representations or      warranties concerning the Products, except to the extent (if any) contained      within Promotions delivered to CNET by the Company.\n\n8.   Mutual Indemnification.\n\n     8.1  Indemnification by CNET. CNET shall indemnify and hold the Company           harmless from and against any costs, losses, liabilities and expenses,           including all court costs, reasonable expenses and reasonable           attorney's fees (collectively, \"Losses\") that the Company may suffer,           incur or be subjected to by reason of any legal action, proceeding,           arbitration or other claim by a third party, whether commenced or           threatened, arising out of or as a result of (a) any breach or alleged           breach by CNET of its representations, warranties or covenants           hereunder; or (b) the operation of the CNET Sites (except in cases           where the Company is required to indemnify CNET under the following           paragraph), including claims of infringement or misappropriation of           intellectual property rights.\n\n     8.2  Indemnification by the Company. The Company shall indemnify and hold           CNET harmless from and against any Losses that CNET may suffer, incur           or be subjected to by reason of any legal action, proceeding,\n\n\n\n\n\n          arbitration or other claim by a third party, whether commenced or           threatened, arising out of or as a result of (a) any breach or alleged           breach by the Company of its representations, warranties or covenants           hereunder; (b) the use by CNET of the Company Marks or any content           provided by the Company to CNET expressly for display in connection           with or as part of the Promotions, including claims of infringement or           misappropriation of intellectual property rights; or (c) the operation           of the Company Site or the offer or sale of the Products by the           Company or through the Company Site.\n\n     8.3  Indemnification Procedures. If any party entitled to indemnification           under this section (an \"Indemnified Party\") makes an indemnification           request to the other, the Indemnified Party shall permit the other           party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") to control the defense, disposition           or settlement of the matter at its own expense; provided that the           Indemnifying Party shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified           Party enter into any settlement or agree to any disposition that           imposes an obligation on the Indemnified Party that is not wholly           discharged or dischargeable by the Indemnifying Party, or imposes any           conditions or obligations on the Indemnified Party other than the           payment of monies that are readily measurable for purposes of           determining the monetary indemnification or reimbursement obligations           of Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party shall\n\n            notify Indemnifying Party promptly of any claim for which Indemnifying           Party is responsible and shall cooperate with Indemnifying Party in           every commercially reasonable way to facilitate defense of any such           claim; provided that the Indemnified Party's failure to notify           Indemnifying Party shall not diminish Indemnifying Party's obligations           under this Section except to the extent that Indemnifying Party is           materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. An Indemnified           Party shall at all times have the option to participate in any matter           or litigation through counsel of its own selection and at its own           expense.\n\n9.   Miscellaneous.\n\n     9.1  LIMITATION OF DAMAGES.

Each Order shall detail the total order quantity of the Product and the requested date of delivery (taking into consideration up to 4 months lead time). Within 5 business days following the receipt of each Order, Supplier shall acknowledge receipt of such Order. No Order shall be binding upon Supplier until such written acknowledgment was sent by Supplier to Reseller; provided that Supplier shall confirm or reject such Orders at its discretion. ***. Packaging, Samples and Transportation Immediately upon delivery of the Products at the Reseller's facilities within the Territory (\"Arrival Date\"), Reseller shall visually inspect the Products and the appropriate documents, and employ good receiving/delivering procedures, verification of the Products to confirm origin, identity, quantity, labeled storage conditions, integrity of the packaging as well as any other inspection, as may be required by applicable laws or regulations. Reseller shall ensure that the Products are delivered with appropriate information and documentation, and shall not make any changes to the Products or to the packaging or labeling thereof, or to the legal documents included in the Products' packages, without Supplier's prior written consent (subject to the right of the Reseller to make changes to such materials as are described in Section 2.4). Reseller shall ensure traceability of the delivered Products. Defective Products; Warranty; Support ***. During the Term Supplier may extend an offer to Reseller for a Returns Discount Program, whereby the Supplier will rebate a percentage of the cost of goods sold in lieu of accepting End-User returns. In the event no Returns Discount Program has been entered into by the Parties, Supplier will not accept Returned Product, except for cases of Defective Products. ***. ***. Intellectual Property Supplier shall retain all its rights and title to and ownership of all intellectual property rights in the Products including, inter alia, all documentation, enhancements, improvements or other modifications made thereof (including those modifications made in connection with Section 3.1 above), and except as expressly provided in this Agreement, Reseller shall have no right, title, or interest in any intellectual property rights in the Products. Nothing in this Section shall limit the rights of the Reseller in or to any modifications made to the Software in accordance with Section 2.3. Reseller shall: (a) not do or omit to do, nor authorize any third party to do or omit to do, any act or omission that would or might invalidate or be inconsistent with any of Supplier's intellectual property rights; (b) promptly notify Supplier of any actual, threatened, or suspected infringement of any of Supplier's intellectual property rights that comes to Reseller's notice; and (c) at Supplier's request and expense, do all such things as may be reasonably required to assist Supplier in taking or resisting any proceedings in relation to any such infringement or claim. Confidential Information. Each Party agrees that it will maintain the confidentiality of all electronic, oral, and written communications from the other Party which should reasonably be regarded in the normal commercial view, as constituting confidential information, trade secrets or proprietary information (\"Confidential Information\") and use such Confidential Information only as necessary to exercise a Party's rights or perform a Party's obligations under this Agreement. Each Party shall: (i) safeguard and keep secret all Confidential Information, and will not directly or indirectly disclose to any third party the Confidential Information without written permission of the other; and (ii) in performing its obligations hereunder, use at least the same degree of care as it does with respect to its own confidential information of like importance but, in any event, at least reasonable care. Any information related to the Products shall be considered the Supplier's Confidential Information. If either Party becomes legally obliged to make disclosure of the other Party's Confidential Information, that Party shall immediately notify the first Party and reasonably cooperate with the first Party in any efforts to limit or object to the disclosure.\n\n3.3.\n\n4. 4.1. 4.2.\n\n4.3.\n\n4.4. 5. 5.1.\n\n5.2.\n\n6. 6.1. 6.2.\n\n6.3. 6.4. 7. 7.1.\n\n7.2.\n\n8.\n\nSource: HEALTHCARE INTEGRATED TECHNOLOGIES INC., 8-K, 8/12/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer of Warranties.

Reseller shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Supplier and its employees, officers, directors, suppliers, and successors from and against any third-party claim, suit, proceeding, damages, losses and/or liability arising from or related to (i) Reseller's breach of any provision of this Agreement; and/or (ii) Reseller's interaction and/or relationship with any Customer and/or End User or other third party. Term and Termination This Agreement shall become effective on the Effective Date and shall remain in effect for an initial period of 1 year (\"Initial Term\"). Thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically be renewed for successive 1-year terms (each a \"Renewal Term\", and together with the Initial Term, the \"Term\"). Following the Initial Term, either Party may terminate this Agreement without cause upon written notice to the other Party of at least 3 months. Without derogating from any other remedies that any Party may have under the terms of this Agreement or at law, each Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement forthwith upon the occurrence of any of the following: (i) the other Party is in material breach of its obligations hereunder and fails to remedy such breach within 30 days after being requested in writing to do so; or (ii) the other Party's bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, whether voluntarily or otherwise, or if it makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors. Upon any termination of this Agreement: (i) all rights granted by Supplier to Reseller under the Agreement revert to Supplier; (ii) Reseller shall transfer to Supplier all data, reports and any other information generated by Reseller in the course of performance of this Agreement; and (iii) any payment obligation which had accrued or become payable prior to the date of termination (including the payment obligation under Section 4.2) shall survive termination of this Agreement.

In addition to the foregoing, if, at the time of termination of this Agreement, Reseller shall have additional Product units in its inventory and is able to sell them to Customers and/or End Users (including, without limitation, any Product units for which Reseller has or is obligated to pay the Supplier the purchase price therefor but which have not yet been delivered to the Reseller by Supplier, which Supplier hereby agrees to either deliver as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement as if it had not terminated or to refund the purchase price therefor), then the licenses and appointments described in Section 2 shall remain in effect with respect to such unsold Product units (and such Section 2 shall not terminate) until the earlier of (i) the date on which the last Product in Reseller's inventory is sold to a Customer and/or End User, or (ii) 1 year from the date of the termination of this Agreement. ***. General Supplier and/or Reseller may assign or novate this Agreement and the rights and obligations under it to any of its affiliates or upon any merger or acquisition or the sale of all or substantially all of its assets relating to the Agreement. Any purported assignment of rights in violation of this subsection is void. The relationship between the Parties is that of supplier and purchaser. Reseller is an independent contractor and is not the legal representative, agent, joint venture, partner, or employee of Supplier. Reseller may describe itself as Supplier's 'authorized distributor', but may not hold itself out as the Supplier's agent. Reseller has no authority to assume or create any obligations of any kind or to make any representations or warranties, whether express or implied, on behalf of the Supplier, nor to bind the Supplier in any respect.\n\n9.\n\n10. 10.1.\n\n10.2.\n\n11.\n\n12. 12.1.\n\n12.2.\n\n12.3.\n\n12.4.\n\n13. 14. 14.1.\n\n14.2.\n\nSource: HEALTHCARE INTEGRATED TECHNOLOGIES INC., 8-K, 8/12/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nExcept as to the timely payment by Reseller for the Products purchased under this Agreement, no failure or omission to carry out or observe any provision of this Agreement shall give rise to any claim by one Party against the other, or be a breach of this Agreement, if the same is caused by or arises out of circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the other Party, including technical difficulties beyond such Party's reasonable control that delay or prevent manufacture (\"Force Majeure\"). However, the Parties shall endeavor to avoid, remove, or cure all such conditions as soon as is reasonably feasible. If either Party is prevented or hindered from carrying out its obligations under this Agreement due to a Force Majeure, this Agreement shall be suspended as long as the Force Majeure persists. If such period exceeds 1 month, either Party may terminate this Agreement on giving written notice to the other. No failure or delay on the part of either Party to exercise any right or remedy under this Agreement shall be construed or operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy preclude the further exercise of such right or remedy. If any provision or part of any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as if the Agreement had been executed without that provision or part. All notices or other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given in person, by courier or by registered mail (provided that written confirmation of receipt is provided) addressed as set forth in the heading of this Agreement or such other address as any Party may designate to the other in accordance with this procedure. All communications delivered in person or by courier service shall be deemed to have been received upon delivery, shall be deemed to have been received on the business day following transmission with confirmed answer back, and all notices and other communications sent by registered mail shall be deemed to have been received within 3 business days after posting. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York and all disputes and controversies arising out of or in connection with the Agreement shall be brought exclusively before the competent courts in New York County, New York; provided however that judgment shall be enforceable in any country and that nothing in this Section shall prevent or restrict either Party from seeking interim relief in any competent jurisdiction as it may deem fit. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Supplier and the Reseller. All previous or contemporaneous agreements, proposals, understandings, and communications between the Supplier and the Reseller are replaced in their entirety by this Agreement. In entering into this Agreement, neither Party has relied on any warranties, representations, or other matters other than as set out in this Agreement. All conditions, warranties, or other terms implied by statute or common law are excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law. This Agreement may be amended only by a written instrument executed by authorized representatives of the Parties. Each of Reseller and Supplier will, respectively, ensure that it and its employees, agents or affiliates, or by any independent contractors on its behalf or for its benefit, shall comply with the United States' Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78dd-1 et seq.) and any analogous anti-bribery and anti-corruption law, rule, regulation that may apply to any of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, including but not limited to in connection with the sale, resale, import, export, transportation, or shipment of the Products. Neither party to this Agreement will make any payment, directly or indirectly, of money or other assets, including but not limited to compensation derived from this Agreement or any Order placed under it, to government or political party officials, officials of international organizations, candidates for public office, or representatives of other businesses or persons acting on behalf of any of the foregoing, that would constitute a violation of any law, rule, or regulation.

This Agreement is effective as of August 1, 2004, (the \"Effective Date\") and shall terminate on July 31, 2009, (the \"Termination Date\") unless earlier terminated or extended as provided for herein.\n\nThe following points outline this agreement:\n\n1.       PURPOSE\n\nUnder and subject to the terms of this Agreement:\n\na.       AEIS will provide Schoolpop for resale the following stored                   value cards: Encompass(R) Select, Persona(R) Select, Fill It                   Up(R), and Be My Guest(R), and any other stored value products                   developed by AEIS and mutually agreed upon by both parties,                   (\"Cards\"). The Cards shall be sold only to those of                   Schoolpop's clients and prospective clients (the \"Clients\"),                   in the United States who are nonprofit organizations, (\"NPO                   Marketplace\"), which are defined as organizations that are (i)                   a school, (ii) an organization formed as not-for-profit under                   its charter documents, or (iii) an organization related to (i)                   or (ii) such as a participating school's Parent Teacher                   Organization or other similarly related organization.\n\nb.       Period One shall mean the Effective Date through the date that                   Schoolpop has met all of the Security Requirements as such                   term is defined herein and has received approval from AEIS to                   assume all Card inventory, distribution and fulfillment                   responsibilities as currently managed by AEIS. Period Two                   shall commence with the end of Period One through the                   Termination Date.\n\n2.       EXCLUSIVITY\n\na.       Schoolpop shall have the exclusive right to resell Cards in                   the NPO Marketplace. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Schoolpop                   shall fund from AEIS a minimum of $52,000,000 of Cards (the                   \"Guaranteed Minimum\") in each Contract Year in order to                   maintain the exclusive right to sell Cards in the NPO                   Marketplace. A Contract Year shall be the period of August 1                   through July 31 of the succeeding year. In any Contract Year                   in which Schoolpop fails to fund the Guaranteed Minimum, AEIS                   shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to (a) terminate                   the Agreement or (b) revoke the exclusivity.\n\nb.       In consideration of the exclusivity referred to above,                   Schoolpop shall pay AEIS a marketing rights fee (\"Marketing                   Rights Fee\"), of $1,250,000. The Marketing Rights Fee shall be                   paid in five (5) equal installments of $250,000 on March 15th                   of each year with the first such payment being due on March                   15, 2005 and with the final payment due on March 15, 2009.\n\nc.       Schoolpop shall also pay AEIS a fee of $250,000, (the                   \"Encompass(R) Select Fee\") as consideration for the right to                   sell the Encompass(R) Select Card through December 31, 2004.                   The Encompass(R) Select Fee shall be payable concurrently with                   the execution of this Agreement.\n\nd.       Schoolpop understands and agrees that this Agreement does not                   grant Schoolpop any exclusive right to market the Cards or any                   other AEIS products and services outside of the NPO                   Marketplace. AEIS, on its own behalf, reserves the right to                   market its Cards and other products and services directly as\n\n1\n\nwell as through additional firms on terms and conditions that                   it selects in its sole discretion, provided that no such sales                   shall take place within the NPO Marketplace.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.       INVENTORY AND FORECASTING\n\na.       Schoolpop shall secure a physical location for maintaining,                   distributing, and fulfilling Card inventory no later than                   August 1, 2004 which location shall be subject to such                   security requirements (the \"Security Requirements\") as shall                   be required by AEIS or American Express Travel Related                   Services, Inc. all as further set forth in the Trust Agreement                   attached hereto as Exhibit 1.\n\nb.       Schoolpop shall effectively manage its Card inventory and                   Ordering schedule such that all Cards are resold and                   distributed to the Client with the following Card expiration                   lives (the \"Card Life\") intact:\n\ni.       Persona(R) Select - nine (9) months                   ii.      Encompass(R) Select, Be My Guest(R), Fill It Up(R) -                            three (3) months          The Card life of any Cards other than Cards specifically indicated in          b(i). and b(ii) above (\"New Cards\"), shall be mutually agreed upon in          writing.\n\nc.       During Period One, Card expiration shall be determined by the                   date Schoolpop places an Order (the \"Order\") and provides full                   payment and clearance of funding. During Period Two, Card Life                   shall be determined by the date Schoolpop places an Order.\n\nd.       Should any Card expire or lose Card Life prior to                   distribution, Schoolpop shall assume all loss associated with                   the Card funding, if applicable, and shall pay AEIS a $2.00                   per Card destruction fee. Schoolpop shall not return such                   Cards to AEIS, and shall follow the destruction process as                   detailed in the Trust Agreement.\n\ne.       Card Life shall be unaffected by the termination of this                   Agreement.\n\nf.       From the Effective Date through September 30, 2004, Schoolpop                   may order non-standard Encompass(R) Select denominations                   (other than 25, 50, 75, and 100 Points) up to a maximum of 200                   Points. Such non-standard Encompass(R) Select denominations                   require eight (8) weeks to fulfill and must be ordered in                   boxes of 100 Cards of like denominations. Schoolpop shall                   discontinue reselling Encompass(R) Select Cards on December                   31, 2004 and shall effectively manage and forecast                   Encompass(R) Select Card needs to deplete such inventory as of                   December 31, 2004. In the event that any unsold Encompass(R)                   Select Cards remain in inventory by Schoolpop on December 31,                   2004, Schoolpop shall provide to AEIS, no later than January                   5, 2005, the Encompass(R) Select Card numbers, the respective                   expiration dates and denominations of the Cards. AEIS shall                   invoice Schoolpop for the applicable Card destruction fees                   which shall be payable by Schoolpop within thirty days (30) of                   receipt of invoice. Such Card list shall be submitted on a                   disk/CD and shall be sent via a form of shipment where                   signature is required upon delivery.\n\ng.       Effective with Period Two, Schoolpop shall provide to AEIS a                   twelve (12) month sold Card forecast and Card inventory                   forecast (hereinafter defined). In addition, Schoolpop shall                   provide AEIS with a monthly forecast, no later than the third                   business day of each month, of the number of Cards to be sold                   to its clients, (\"Sold Card Forecast\") as well as the number                   of Cards to be stocked in inventory, (\"Card Inventory                   Forecast\"), (collectively referred to as the \"Forecasts\") for                   the month, ninety-days out. For example, Schoolpop shall                   provide AEIS with the Card Inventory Forecast and Sold Card                   Forecast in August for the month of November. The Forecasts                   will be relied on, (\"Locked\") at the time they are reported.\n\nh.       Changes to the Forecasts within the Locked period are                   expected. However, any changes to Locked Forecasts will not                   impact any applicable penalties as detailed below in                   subsections (i) and (j). AEIS will place reliance on the                   Forecasts provided by Schoolpop to align resources and ensure                   adequate production, fulfillment and customer service                   capabilities.

In any given month where the difference between the Sold Card                   Forecast less the actual Card activation volume, (\"Cards in                   Force\") is a shortage of ten percent or greater (10%+), AEIS                   reserves the right to assess a penalty, the (\"Customer Service                   Penalty\") which shall be calculated by converting Cards in                   Force into call volume minutes as follows:\n\ni.       Cards in Force times the call to card ratio times the                            average handle time equals the total call volume                            minutes. AEIS will calculate the respective product's                            average year-to-date call to Card ratio and the                            average year-to-date handle time monthly to calculate                            the call volume minutes. For purposes of example, the                            year-to-date through August 2004, Encompass(R) Select                            average call to Card ratio is 2.43 and the average                            handle time is 4.0 minutes.\n\n&sbsp;      ii.      Actual call volume minutes under 90% of the Card Sold                            Forecast will be charged at 90% of Locked Rolling                            Forecast at the standard rate of $0.50 per minute.                            Schoolpop's Customer Service Penalty shall be                            calculated at the difference between actual call                            volume minutes and 90% of Card Sold Forecast call                            volume minutes.\n\niii.

At any given time during this Agreement, Schoolpop's inactive                   Card inventory shall be limited to $3,000,000 in Card value as                   determined by the Point denomination on each Card. This limit                 &sbsp; shall consist of a maximum Card value of $1,500,000 in                   Encompass(R) Select Cards and $1,500,000 Card value in any                   other product (s). Effective January 1, 2005, after which                   Encompass(R) Select shall no longer be available to Schoolpop,                   the maximum inactive Card value shall not exceed $3,000,000 in                   any combination of products at any given time.

CARD ISSUANCE\n\na.       Schoolpop agrees that it will review all requests for each                   Program requested by the Client and will use reasonable and                   customary business practices to qualify and recommend Clients                   proposed for a Program. Schoolpop shall take commercially                   reasonable efforts to ensure all information requested for a                   Client is true, accurate and correct.\n\nb.       AEIS may, from time to time, provide Schoolpop with                   commercially reasonable qualification standards for Clients.                   Schoolpop shall not knowingly submit an Order to AEIS on                   behalf of any Client that does not meet any such standards.                   Schoolpop agrees that it will sell Cards only to Clients and                   only for use in connection with a bona fide fund raising                   program. Schoolpop will not knowingly sell Cards to any Client                   who does not meet any AEIS qualification standard(s) or to any\n\n3\n\nClient or potential Client that Schoolpop has reason to believe would          be unsatisfactory to AEIS.\n\nc.       AEIS reserves the right at any time, with or without cause,                   with reasonable written notice to Schoolpop, to cancel or                   decline any Client's participation in the Program.\n\nd.       AEIS may, at its sole discretion, decline to provide Cards to                   Clients.\n\ne.       Cards are intended for use in the United States and must be                   designated for receipt of shipment within the United States.\n\nf.       AEIS' designated vendor will be responsible for shipping Cards                   in accordance with Schoolpop's instructions.\n\ng.       AEIS's designated vendor will ship the Cards as follows:\n\ni.       During Period One, AEIS' designated vendor will use                            reasonable commercial efforts to ship the Cards as                            detailed below, following receipt and clearance by                            AEIS of Card Funding.\n\nii.

One point is worth one (1) U.S. Dollar ($1.00 USD) (\"Point\").\n\ni.       AEIS shall ship Cards in bulk shipment via its designated                   vendor to Schoolpop, F.O.B. Atlanta, Georgia. Schoolpop shall                   distribute to each Cardholder the Cardholder agreement as                   provided with each Card and which includes instructions on                   \"How to Use the Card\". Should Schoolpop or its Client                   distribute Cards without such Cardholder agreement, Schoolpop                   shall indemnify and hold harmless AEIS, its parents,                   subsidiaries and their respective affiliates, officers,                   directors, employees and agents, against any and all Loss,                   hereinafter defined, that AEIS may incur or be subjected to as                   a result of such action, including, without limitation, any                   claims brought by any entity including but not limited to                   governmental entities and Cardholders.\n\nj.       Purchases made with a Card having insufficient Points will be                   deemed a deniable transaction. The correct way to handle the                   purchase is described in the Cardholder agreement. If there is                   a purchase made on a Card where there are insufficient Points                   on the Card, the negative amount will be the responsibility of                   the person whose signature appears on the Card, as described                   in the Cardholder agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nk.       CARDS LOST OR STOLEN IN TRANSIT IN THE INITIAL SHIPMENT FROM                   AEIS WILL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF AEIS. The full risk of loss                   for ordered Cards shall pass to Schoolpop immediately upon                   their delivery to Schoolpop by AEIS and AEIS shall not                   reimburse Schoolpop or Client for any delivered Card that is                   lost, stolen, misappropriated, or that otherwise disappears or                   is fraudulently or inappropriately used (together referred to                   as \"Loss\"). Schoolpop shall remain solely liable for any Loss                   caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of its                   employees, agents or representatives after the shipment has                   been received by Schoolpop. AEIS will not reimburse Schoolpop                   or its Client or be responsible for any Loss in connection                   with or after delivery of Cards to Schoolpop, its Clients or                   the Cardholder whether they are shipped to Schoolpop, its                   Client, or to either of their pre-designated delivery agents.                   Only Cardholders are eligible to receive replacements from                   AEIS and replacements are given only in accordance with the                   agreement between the Cardholder and AEIS. Cards are usually                   shipped in packaging with AEIS' designated vendor as the                   return address. Notwithstanding the foregoing, AEIS shall bear                   no risk of Loss and of non-receipt of Cards by the intended                   Cardholder in the event that AEIS is instructed to use another                   address as the return address, the address provided to AEIS                   for Schoolpop or the Client was incorrect, the request for the                   Card was unauthorized, and/or any information received by AEIS                   with regard to the processing of the Order was fraudulent or                   incorrect.\n\nl.       All agreements entered into between Schoolpop and its Clients,                   shall contain a provision substantially similar to the                   preceding Section 3 (k).\n\n4\n\nm.       During the term hereof, Schoolpop shall maintain at all times                   the following information with respect to Card resale and                   distribution to Client:\n\ni.

Schoolpop warrants it shall take measures to                   track information about its Clients which shall meet                   compliance requirements related to the above stated laws,                   track all Card shipment(s) to each such Client, and maintain                   appropriate records for its Clients for a period of seven (7)                   years after termination of the Agreement and to provide such                   records and other information to AEIS upon reasonable request                   and subject to applicable law. Schoolpop shall further inform                   in writing all of its Clients of their requirement to comply                   with all applicable laws concerning the use of Cards,                   including those laws stated in the previous sentence. School                   shall inform its Clients of the requirement to maintain                   records with respect to the Cards and Cardholders, and to                   verify the identity of Cardholders as required by law, to                   maintain records of the information used to verify each                   Cardholder's identity, to retain such records for at least                   seven (7) years following the date of distribution, including    &sbsp;              name, home address, Card number, and other identifying                   information, and the name, title and phone number of the                   individual responsible for maintaining such records, and to                   provide such records and other information to AEIS upon                   reasonable request and subject to applicable law. Schoolpop                   and Schoolpop's Clients shall establish and maintain an                   anti-money laundering program with an assigned compliance                   officer and compliance program.

Notwithstanding the foregoing,                   Confidential Information shall not include (d) information                   that is publicly known, already known by, or in the possession                   of the non-disclosing party, or (e) is independently developed                   by the non-disclosing party without use or reference to the                   other party's Confidential Information, or (f) is rightly\n\n9\n\nobtained by the non-disclosing party from a source other than                   the disclosing party without such restrictions.\n\nd.

If any such employee, affiliate,                   agent, subcontractor or professional advisor discloses or uses                   the Confidential Information in a manner not permitted under                   this Agreement, the party disclosing the Confidential                   Information to such employee, affiliate, agent, subcontractor                   or professional advisor will be liable therefore. If either                   party is required by law to disclose Confidential Information,                   it may be disclosed, provided that, unless prohibited,                   sufficient prior notice is given to the non-disclosing party                   to afford it an opportunity to take whatever steps it deems                   necessary to protect the confidential nature of the                   Confidential Information. In the event a party is required to                   disclose the other party's Confidential Information in                   connection with any judicial proceeding or government                   investigation, a notification of such requirement shall                   promptly occur allowing a reasonable time for the appropriate                   party to seek a protective Order from the appropriate court or                   government agency. Thereafter, Confidential Information may be                   disclosed to the extent required by law, subject to any                   applicable protective Order.\n\ne.       Upon request of the other party, each party will promptly\n\n\n\n\n\nreturn to the other any or all Confidential Information of the                   other then in its possession or under its control provided,                   however, that each party may retain one copy of all such                   Confidential Information solely for its own internal records,                   such Confidential Information to remain subject to the                   restrictions on use and disclosure contained in this Agreement\n\nf.

Such destruction must be evidenced by execution of AEIS'                   Destruction Certificate, which is attached hereto as Schedule                   II. The Destruction Certificate shall be executed by Seller                   through two authorized signatures and shall particularly                   describe the Cards by (1) Card product name, (2) Card number,                   (3) denomination, (4) shipment tracking number, and (5)                   quantity by product and denomination, and account number.                   Seller shall pay AEIS associated destruction fees for such                   Card destruction as detailed within the Destruction                   Certificate.

This includes ALL advertising, promotional and marketing materials in any medium (INCLUDING: COMMUNICATIONS, ADVERTISING, SALES PROMOTION COLLATERAL, DIRECT MAIL, PRESS RELEASES, VIDEOS, WEB SITES, PROMOTIONAL ITEMS, SALES PRESENTATIONS AND SIMILAR MATERIALS.) Copy and layout should be submitted as early as possible. Due to the type of communications piece, approval could take anywhere from 3 to 10 business days.\n\nMERCHANT SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION FOR APPROVAL GUIDELINES\n\nConsumer applications are typically more involved. Generally, consumer programs are targeted to a wider audience; therefore, the implications are greater for the merchant. For this reason, the merchants mandate that AEIS seek individual approvals from each and every merchant.\n\nAny standard applications using customized collateral should be reviewed by AEIS for content and accuracy. Even in the cases where standard program materials are to be used, AEIS will need to internally review any customized announcements and/or teasers. More than likely, these pieces feature only merchant names or merchant lists in print and can typically be approved within 24-48 hours.\n\nPieces using only select groups of merchants, photos or logos will generally require a higher level of approval and depending on the merchants used, may require approval from the merchant as well. The approval timeline will range from three to ten (3-10) business days for existing/ongoing.\n\nOnce, layout and copy are approved by AEIS Communications Group, Merchant Partnerships, Operations and American Express, any ongoing and additional changes must also be approved.\n\nIMAGES, LOGOS, PRODUCT PATENT, AND REGISTERED/SERVICE MARKS\n\nIMAGES AND LOGOS The following are examples of merchant image and logo usage, which require merchant approval through Merchant Partnerships:\n\no        Any communication or collateral, whether standard or customized,          containing merchant images or logos must be reviewed by Merchant          Partnerships o        Any new design work of merchant logos and images not previously          approved o        Use of standard merchant logos in any color other than the original          color o        Unique positioning of merchant images - surrounding merchants, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\no        \"Direct mail\" pieces, which include merchant references when only          \"select\" merchants are referenced. o        Unusual type of creative print work such as posters o        Borders around logos and busy backgrounds o        Any copy or tag-lines not previously approved o        Under no circumstances are press release photos to be used on or in          association with any form of communication relating to incentive card          programs unless approved by Merchant Partnerships' contact. o        Images and/or logos are not to be altered (cropped, inset, or overlaid)          unless approved by Merchant Partnerships' contact. o        All images used in magazine format must be obtain merchant copy write          information next to the image\n\nMERCHANT PARTNERSHIPS RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REMOVE IMAGES AT ANY TIME          THAT MAY BE DEEMED INAPPROPRIATE REPRESENTATION OF THE MERCHANT (THIS          INCLUDES OUTDATED OR SEASONAL IMAGES AND LOGOS).\n\nALL QUESTIONS REGARDING MERCHANT COMMUNICATION APPROVAL SHOULD BE          SUBMITTED TO ANN FINK AT ANN.FINK@AEIS.COM, 636-226-2043.\n\n27\n\nEXHIBIT 5\n\nCATEGORY CARD TARGET ACQUISITIONS\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PRIMARY CARD                              MARKETING CATEGORIES    TARGET MERCHANTS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CONSUMER CATEGORIES: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              Entertainment -

The term \"Confidential Information\" means all financial, business and technical information disclosed by or on behalf of a party in relation to this Agreement (whether tangible or intangible, and including all copies, analyses and derivatives thereof), that is marked or otherwise identified as proprietary or confidential at the time of disclosure, or which by its nature would be understood by a reasonable person to be proprietary or confidential, including all copies, abstracts, summaries, analyses and derivatives thereof. Confidential Information does not include information the receiving party can demonstrate (a) was rightfully furnished to it without restriction by a third party without breach of any obligation to the disclosing party, (b) is generally available to the public without breach of this Agreement, (c) was available to or already in the possession or control of the receiving party on a non-confidential basis before receipt from the disclosing party or (d) is independently developed by it or its employees without reliance on such information. Information associated with DIALOG's quarterly Royalty or Service Fee disclosures is Confidential Information of DIALOG.   10.2 Non-Disclosure. The receiving party agrees (a) not to copy or use the disclosing party's Confidential Information except and only for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement, (b) to maintain it as confidential, and exercise reasonable precautions to prevent unauthorized access, use and disclosure, (c) not to disclose it to any third party other than the receiving party's employees and contractors who have a need to know for the permitted purpose and who are bound by obligations that are at least as protective as the restrictions in this Agreement and (d) not to export or re-export in violation of U.S. or other export control laws or regulations any such Confidential Information or product thereof.

As such, any warranty claims due to defects in build, materials or workmanship will be directed to the Manufacturing Subcontractors as part of that contract between DIALOG or, if applicable, its Affiliate and such parties.   (c) With the exception of the warranties in Section 11.2(a)(ii) (third party IP infringement) and Section 11.2(a)(iii) (misappropriation of third party trade secrets) related to any Product Die, the warranties in this Section 11.2 do not apply to MCMs or repackaged Product Die developed by or for DIALOG or its Affiliates.   (d) In the event any warranty claim is due to or arises from an Epidemic Defect, ENERGOUS will be responsible for all costs and expenses directly incurred by DIALOG or its Affiliates or their respective customers as a result of reasonable inspection, servicing, repairs, replacements, recall notices, recalls and responses with respect thereto, provided that ENERGOUS' aggregate liability to DIALOG and its Affiliates and their respective customers under this paragraph (d) will not exceed [***] per occurrence of an Epidemic Defect. Each party will immediately notify the other upon becoming aware of the circumstance that could reasonably be construed to be an indication of an Epidemic Defect, and, in any event, will notify the other party immediately upon becoming aware of the existence of an Epidemic Defect. ENERGOUS and DIALOG will expeditiously work together in good faith to determine a technical resolution of the Epidemic Failure. ENERGOUS agrees to make all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly diagnose the Epidemic Failure's root cause, provide DIALOG a report detailing the results of ENERGOUS' investigation and plan an effective workaround and a permanent solution. ENERGOUS will consult with DIALOG on any proposed workarounds and other solutions.   * Confidential Treatment Requested\n\n  Page 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  11.3  Infringement of Intellectual Property Rights. If any of the Products, Product Die, Documentation or Deposit Materials is, or in ENERGOUS' or DIALOG's opinion is likely to become, the subject of an Intellectual Property Rights infringement claim, and as a result DIALOG or any of its Affiliates or their respective customers are enjoined, or in ENERGOUS' or DIALOG's opinion are likely to be enjoined, from using the Products, Product Die, Documentation or Deposit Materials, ENERGOUS will use its best efforts to:   (a) procure for DIALOG and its Affiliates and their respective customers the right to continue to use the Products, Product Die, Documentation or Deposit Materials, as applicable; or, but only in the event that, despite ENERGOUS' best efforts to do so, ENERGOUS is unable to so procure such right,   (b) replace or modify the Products, Product Die, Documentation or Deposit Materials, as applicable, to make them non-infringing, provided that the replaced or modified Products, Product Die, Documentation and Deposit Materials remain substantially similar in performance to the infringing Products, Product Die, Documentation and Deposit Materials.   If none of the foregoing alternatives is available within a commercially reasonable time period, DIALOG may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect, provided that it will give ENERGOUS prompt prior written notice thereof. Nothing in this Section 11.3 is intended to limit DIALOG's rights to indemnification under Section 12 in connection with any such infringement claim.   11.4  Disclaimer. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 11, THE PRODUCTS, THE PRODUCT IP, TOOLING, DOCUMENTATION, DEPOSIT MATERIALS, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND ALL LICENSES, SERVICES AND OTHER ITEMS PROVIDED BY A PARTY TO THE OTHER PARTY HEREUNDER ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

DIALOG will cooperate and provide assistance and information as may reasonably be required by ENERGOUS (but at ENERGOUS' expense) in connection therewith. DIALOG reserves the right to participate at its own cost in any third party proceedings with counsel of its own choosing.

No Service Fees will be payable under this license. DIALOG agrees not to exercise such license until occurrence of a Release Condition, subject to the other restrictions set forth in this Section 16. Such license may be exercised by DIALOG only during the Term and any Wind Down Period or Continuing Obligation period and is subject to DIALOG's continued compliance with all of the other applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement during any such applicable period. All Deposit Materials will be deemed ENERGOUS' Confidential Information hereunder. DIALOG's license to possess and use the Deposit Materials does not include any right to disclose, market, sublicense or distribute the Deposit Materials to any third party other than its Affiliates and Manufacturing Subcontractors.   16.4 Rights in Bankruptcy. The licenses granted pursuant to this Agreement are license to rights in \"intellectual property\" (as that term is defined in Section 101 of the United States Bankruptcy Code) and governed by 11 USC Section 365(n). Accordingly, if a trustee in bankruptcy rejects the Escrow Agreement and/or this Agreement as executory contracts, then Company may elect to retain its rights under this Agreement in accordance with and subject to the provisions of 11 USC Section 365(n).\n\n  Page 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  17. PUBLICITY.   17.1 Publicity.

ENERGOUS and DIALOG acknowledge and agree that the covenants in this Section 18 are reasonable and necessary to protect each of their trade secrets, Confidential Information and stable workforces.   19. CHOICE OF LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION.   19.1 Applicable Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, exclusive of conflict of laws principles.   19.2 Dispute Resolution; Jurisdiction. Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any matters regarding its existence, scope, validity, breach or termination, or any non-contractual obligations arising out of or related to it) that is not able to be resolved through negotiations will be submitted to arbitration in San Francisco, California, administered by the International Chamber of Commerce under its Rules of Arbitration. There will be one arbitrator. The language of the arbitration will be English. The award will be in writing, state the reasons for the award and be final and binding. Judgment on the award may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. Except as may be required by law, the parties will preserve the confidentiality of all aspects of the arbitration. The arbitration will be the sole and exclusive forum for final resolution of any such dispute or claim, provided, however, that, because each party will have access to and become acquainted with Confidential Information of the other party, the unauthorized use or disclosure of which may cause irreparable harm and significant injury which may be difficult to ascertain and which may not be compensable by damages alone, the parties agree that the damaged party will have the right to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief without prejudice to any other rights and remedies that it may have for such unauthorized use or disclosure. Each party irrevocably waives all rights to a jury trial in any judicial proceeding permitted hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, the validity, construction, and enforceability of this Agreement and the resolution of disputes arising out of and relating to this Agreement, will be governed solely by this Section 19.   * Confidential Treatment Requested\n\n  Page 22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  20.

(g) Each Party shall bear its own attorneys' fees, costs, and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the arbitrators; provided, however, that the arbitrators shall be authorized to determine whether a Party is the prevailing Party, and if so, to award to that prevailing Party reimbursement for its reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements (including, for example, expert witness fees and expenses, photocopy charges and travel expenses), and/or the fees and costs of the arbitrators.

(a) Notice. Promptly after a CytoDyn Indemnitee or a Vyera Indemnitee (each, an \"Indemnitee\") receives notice of a pending or threatened Claim, such Indemnitee shall give written notice of the Claim to the Party from whom the Indemnitee is entitled to receive indemnification pursuant to Sections 13.1 or 13.2, as applicable (the \"Indemnifying Party\"). However, an Indemnitee's delay in providing or failure to provide such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except to the extent it can demonstrate actual prejudice due to the delay or lack of notice. (b) Defense. Upon receipt of notice under this Section 13.3 from the Indemnitee, the Indemnifying Party will have the duty to either compromise or defend, at its own expense and by counsel (reasonably satisfactory to Indemnitee) such Claim. The Indemnifying Party will promptly (and in any event not more than twenty (20) days after receipt of the Indemnitee's original notice) notify the Indemnitee in writing that it acknowledges its obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee with respect to the Claim pursuant to this Article 13 and of its intention either to compromise or defend such Claim. Once the Indemnifying Party gives such notice to the Indemnitee, the Indemnifying Party is not liable to the Indemnitee for the fees of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such defense, other than the Indemnitee's reasonable out of pocket Third Party expenses related to its investigation and cooperation, except as otherwise provided in the next sentence. As to all Claims as to which the Indemnifying Party has assumed control under this Section 13.3(b), the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of a Claim (as reasonably directed by the Indemnifying Party) at its own expense; provided, however, that if the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded, based upon a written opinion from outside legal counsel, that there is a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee in the defense of such Claim, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall pay the fees and expenses of one (1) law firm serving as counsel for the Indemnitee in relation to such Third Party Claim. (c) Cooperation. The Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its legal representatives in the investigation and defense of any Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnitee informed on a reasonable and timely basis as to the status of such Claim (to the extent the Indemnitee is not participating in the defense of such Claim) and conduct the defense of such Claim in a prudent manner. (d) Settlement. If an Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Claim, no compromise or settlement of such Claim may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnitee's written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee's consent shall not be required of a settlement where: (i) there is no finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of any person and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the Indemnitee; (ii) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party; (iii) the Indemnitee's rights under this Agreement are not adversely affected; and (iv) there is a full release of the Indemnitee from such Claim. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume defense of a Claim within a reasonable time, the Indemnitee may settle such Claim on such terms as it deems appropriate with the consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee for such settlement as provided in this Article 13. It is understood that only Vyera and CytoDyn may claim indemnification under this Agreement (on its own behalf or on behalf of its Indemnitees), and other Indemnitees may not directly claim indemnity under this Agreement.\n\nSource: CYTODYN INC., 10-Q, 1/9/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n13.4 Insurance. Each Party, at its own expense, shall maintain comprehensive general liability, product liability and other appropriate insurance for the activities such Party undertakes pursuant to this Agreement, from reputable and financially secure insurance carriers in a form and at levels consistent with sound business practice and adequate in light of its obligations under this Agreement. Each Party shall provide a certificate of insurance (or evidence of self-insurance) evidencing such coverage to the other Party upon request. Such insurance will not create a limit to a Party's liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this Article 13 or otherwise. This Section 13.4 will survive expiration or termination of this Agreement for the period in which the Licensed Product is being Commercialized by or on behalf of Vyera plus six (6) years. Each Party shall provide the other Party with prompt written notice of any cancellation, non-renewal or material change in such insurance that could materially adversely affect the rights of the other Party hereunder, and shall provide such notice within thirty (30) days after any such cancellation, non-renewal or material change.\n\n13.5 Limitation of Liability.

Such excuse shall be continued so long as the condition constituting Force Majeure continues and the nonperforming Party takes reasonable efforts to remove the condition.

For clarity, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Vyera from undergoing any Change of Control, but if Vyera undergoes a Change of Control, it will be subject to Section 2.6. CytoDyn may assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder, in whole but not in part, to any Third Party not in a materially worse (financially and otherwise) of performing CytoDyn's obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of Vyera (it being understood that any other assignment of this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder shall require the prior written consent of Vyera, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).\n\n14.7 Severability. If any one (1) or more of the provisions of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction from which no appeal can be or is taken, the provision(s) shall be considered severed from this Agreement and shall not serve to invalidate any remaining provisions hereof. The Parties shall make a good faith effort to replace any invalid or unenforceable provision with a valid and enforceable provision such that the objectives contemplated by the Parties when entering this Agreement may be realized.\n\n14.8 Waiver and Non-Exclusion of Remedies. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition. The waiver by either Party hereto of any right hereunder or of the failure to perform or of a breach by the other Party shall not be deemed a waiver of any other right hereunder or of any other breach or failure by such other Party whether of a similar nature or otherwise. The rights and remedies provided herein are cumulative and do not exclude any other right or remedy provided by Applicable Law or otherwise available except as expressly set forth herein.\n\n14.9 Further Assurance. Each Party shall duly execute and deliver, or cause to be duly executed and delivered, such further instruments and do and cause to be done such further acts and things, including the filing of such assignments, agreements, documents, and instruments, as may be necessary or as the other Party may reasonably request in connection with this Agreement or to carry out more effectively the provisions and purposes hereof.\n\n14.10 Headings. The headings of each Article and Section in this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to limit or expand on the meaning of the language contained in the particular Article or Section.\n\n14.11 Construction. Except where the context otherwise requires, wherever used, the singular shall include the plural, the plural shall include the singular, and the use of any gender shall be applicable to all genders. Whenever this Agreement refers to a number of days without using a term otherwise defined herein, such number refers to calendar days. The terms \"including,\" \"include,\" \"includes\" or \"for example\" shall not limit the generality of any description preceding such term and, as used herein, shall have the same meaning as \"including, but not limited to,\" and/or \"including, without limitation.\" The language of this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language mutually chosen by the Parties and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against either Party hereto. Each Party represents that it has been represented by legal counsel in connection with this Agreement and acknowledges that it has participated in the drafting hereof. In interpreting and applying the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the Parties agree that no presumption will apply against the Party which drafted such terms and provision.\n\nSource: CYTODYN INC., 10-Q, 1/9/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n14.12 Entire Agreement.

It is agreed for                     the purpose hereof, that frequent replacement of key                     personnel shall be deemed as materially impairing                     Contractor's ability to perform hereunder. NICE may reject                     on reasonable grounds any such key personnel employed by                     Contractor in the performance of its obligations hereunder,                     and they shall be replaced by Contractor promptly following                     NICE' first reasoned request. Such personnel shall abide by                     all of NICE' security, data protection and safety                     requirements and policies as indicated from time to time by                     NICE in writing according to Section 17.1.\n\n                    TheContractor will appoint a dedicated Project Manager who                     will coordinate with NICE' representative and serve as a                     single point of contact for NICE in all aspects pertaining                     to this Agreement. The project manager will not be replaced                     at Contractor's initiative during the duration of this                     Agreement to the extent such replacement shall\n\n                                       9\n\n                    materially impair Contractors ability to perform in                     compliance herewith and any such replacement shall take                     place only after consultation with NICE. It is agreed for                     the purpose hereof, that frequent replacement of                     Contractor's Project Manager shall be deemed as materially                     impairing Contractor's ability to perform hereunder. The                     project manager will meet with NICE' representative on a                     regular basis.\n\n               1.2.5. CONTROL AND PLANNING. Without derogating from the                     aforesaid, Contractor will provide NICE with control                     capability of the production. NICE shall be entitled to be                     involved in the planning and establishment of the working                     environment for all Product lines at the Contractor's                     premises. Contractor will provide NICE with reports on a                     daily/ weekly/ monthly basis, as follows: the reports will                     present all relevant details regarding the production                     orders, time between phases, disassembled Products,                     schedules, logistics reports, etc. The reports provided will\n\n\n\n\n\n                    present all said data in a clear manner and will include                     graphic presentations. The reports will enable NICE to                     verify that all systems are matched and to verify the                     improvement that is achieved by Contractor. All said reports                     shall need to be agreed in advance by both Parties.\n\n               1.2.6. SUPERVISION AND MONITORING. NICE shall be entitled but not                     obligated, to supervise and monitor the execution of this                     Agreement from time to time as set forth herein. NICE shall                     be entitled, upon prior coordination, to visit any place                     where the Manufacturing Outsourcing Services are being                     performed including Contractor's plant/s and to review                     samples of components and Products. As a result of such                     supervision, NICE may propose improvements and increase in                     efficiency in the Manufacturing Outsourcing Services and the                     Parties will discuss such proposals and their affect on this                     Agreement. Without derogating from the generality of the                     aforementioned, any supervision and monitoring rights                     granted to NICE hereunder are merely intended to secure                     performance of this Agreement according to its terms and                     shall not relieve Contractor from its responsibilities                     hereunder according to this Agreement or impose any                     responsibility or liability upon NICE which is not                     explicitly detailed in this Agreement.\n\n                                       10\n\n               1.2.7. MEASUREMENTS AND PROCEDURES. Contractor will execute all                     the production stages required for a Product according to                     NICE' Production File for the particular Product, included                     in the PDM System.\n\n               1.2.8. QUALITY ASSURANCE REQUIREMENTS. The Manufacturing                     Outsourcing Services performed by Contractor shall be                     executed according to and comply with all quality control                     requirements and specifications described in APPENDIX J.                     Without derogating from Contractor's responsibility as                     aforementioned, NICE reserves the right to execute quality                     assurance inspection on Contractor's premises, all as                     described in APPENDIX J and according to the terms hereof.\n\n               1.2.9. BACK-UP SITE. Contractor will ensure the availability of                     the Back-up Site according to the terms of this Agreement.

STEERING COMMITTEE. The Parties will appoint a steering                     committee which shall monitor the execution of this                     Agreement, comprised of Contractor's project manager, NICE'                     representative, and relevant personnel of the Parties.\n\n     2.   COMPONENTS PURCHASING, NICE COMPONENTS AND INVENTORY.\n\n          2.1. COMPONENTS PURCHASING. Upon transition to the third phase -                Production, the Contractor will be responsible for all purchasing                of components and getting equipped with all the materials                necessary for the assembly of the Products (except the Non                Generic Equipment). At NICE' request, and without derogating from                any other provisions of this Agreement, Contractor shall promptly                notify NICE, in writing, who are the suppliers of any specific                components and under what agreements purchase is effected.\n\n          2.2. CONTRACTOR PURCHASE AGREEMENTS. Without derogating from the                aforementioned, NICE may, at its sole discretion, decide to be                involved and to actively or inactively, participate in                negotiations and purchasing agreements of Contractor for                components designated for production hereunder. In such event,                Contractor will comply with NICE' requirements and instructions                and contract accordingly, without imposing any liability on NICE,                provided such instructions\n\n                                       11\n\n               are in accordance with common purchasing practice and in                accordance with this Agreement. NICE may, at its election,                instruct Contractor not to purchase a relevant component from a                specific supplier, provided an alternative supplier exists.                APPENDIX C shall be updated accordingly. At NICE' request,                Contractor shall notify any relevant supplier that it is                purchasing components for NICE Products and shall further furnish                the supplier with information requested by such supplier. In any                event, Contractor shall report to NICE on its purchasing                negotiations and achievements and shall supply NICE, at NICE'                request, with a copy of all relevant existing documentation.\n\n          2.3. FLEXTRONICS, INC. GLOBAL PURCHASE AGREEMENTS. Nevertheless, in                the event that the purchase agreement is signed by Flextronics,                Inc. as a global purchase agreement for the Flextronics group,                and not as a local agreement of Contractor or as an agreement                applying to NICE required components only, then NICE will not                participate in the negotiations and will not be entitled to                receive copies of such agreement/s. The details relevant to the                components purchased under an agreement as above will be included\n\n\n\n\n\n               in APPENDIX C and Contractor hereby declares and undertakes that                the details included in APPENDIX C (as amended from time to time                according to the provisions of this Agreement) shall be the                accurate details from the Flextronics, Inc. global purchase                agreements and components and sub assembly prices in APPENDIX C                shall be net purchase prices of Contractor without any overhead                or uplift. NICE shall be entitled, at its sole discretion, to                object in advance to Contractor using any Flextronics, Inc.                global purchase agreement and in such event, Contractor shall                purchase the components separately, the provisions of Section                2.2. shall apply and APPENDIX C shall be updated accordingly.                Contractor undertakes to comply with NICE' instructions and the                manufacturer license terms regarding the use and duplication of                Microsoft and other third party software supplied by NICE and not                to use such software products for any purpose other than in the                assembly of the Products. Contractor will copy from the master CD                of those software products only the exact number of licenses                designated by NICE in writing and for which a license has been                issued by NICE.\n\n          2.4. NICE DESIGNATED COMPONENTS. NICE may request Contractor to                purchase specific components from specific suppliers, provided                that the terms of such suppliers are in accordance with common                purchasing practices and APPENDIX C shall be updated accordingly.\n\n               When purchasing components for Contractor's other customers,                Contractor may not represent itself to the suppliers as a NICE                outsourcer for the purposes of such purchase.\n\n          2.5. NICE SUPPLIED COMPONENTS. NICE may, at its election, supply to                Contractor software licenses and software or the like for which                NICE has an existing royalty agreement with a third party (except                electrical and mechanical components unless agreed otherwise), in                lieu of Contractor purchasing same (\"NICE COMPONENTS\"). All\n\n                                       12\n\n               such components will be delivered to Contractor in a mutually                agreed package type, and in an agreed upon time and in agreed                upon quantities. The parties will agree on the inventory level                required by Contractor for each NICE Component and NICE' sole                responsibility shall be to renew the inventory upon request.                Contractor shall be responsible for ordering additional NICE                Components if required above the inventory level and for ensuring                that appropriate physical controls of such components are in                place and properly administered. Contractor will not charge NICE                any charges or overhead for such NICE Components. In the event                Contractor has difficulty in purchasing any components which NICE                can obtain and NICE has granted its consent to supply such                component to Contractor in lieu of Contractor purchasing same,                Contractor will not charge NICE any charges or overhead for such                Components.\n\n          2.6. INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND USE OF EXISTING INVENTORY. All                purchasing of inventory, use of inventory, and management of                inventory shall be performed by Contractor according to this                Agreement, and APPENDIX C.\n\n          2.7. EXISTING NICE INVENTORY. Furthermore, Contractor will purchase                from NICE its existing inventory of components available for use                in Products for up to six (6) months on a rolling basis, as                detailed in APPENDIX F, all of which will be transferred to                Contractor's facility on the purchase date, all as detailed                hereunder: On the Effective Date Contractor will purchase the                inventory included in part I of APPENDIX F. Regarding the                remainder of the inventory included in part II of APPENDIX F the                following will apply: at the beginning of the first production                Quarter hereunder Contractor will purchase the components                required under the Forecast issued by NICE for that Quarter                regardless of the Total Lead Time for such components; at the                beginning of the second production Quarter hereunder Contractor                will purchase the components required under the Forecast issued                by NICE for that Quarter regardless of the Total Lead Time for                such components; Contractor will purchase any components                remaining in APPENDIX F after two Quarters as aforementioned, on                a current basis as required under the Forecast issued by NICE for                the following Quarters but in compliance with the Total Lead Time                for such components. Contractor will use said NICE' inventory for                the production of the Products rather than purchase such                components from third parties, until full use of all NICE                inventory. Contractor shall pay NICE the purchase price of such                components, as set forth in APPENDIX C hereto, and under payment                terms as set forth in Section 8.4. When sold to NICE as part of                aProduct, the component prices paid by NICE to Contractor                hereunder will be calculated with a reduced overhead of 2%. NICE                will and does hereby provide Contractor with all such warranties                with respect to the components sold thereby as is required from                Contractor under this Agreement with respect to the same                components. Furthermore, without derogating from NICE'                undertakings hereunder, Contractor will use its international                supply chain in order to assist NICE in selling its dead                inventory, which is not included in APPENDIX F, and the proceeds                from such sales will be shared as follows: 10% Contractor, 90%                NICE. Contractor will report to NICE regularly, on such sales.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                       13\n\n          2.8. COMPONENT END OF LIFE. Contractor shall take all necessary                measures in order to receive immediate updates from its suppliers                regarding end of life of any component (i.e types of components                which shall no longer be manufactured). Contractor shall notify                NICE immediately upon becoming aware of the event of end of life                of a component. In such event, NICE shall designate and approve                the replacement components to be used instead and the Parties                will mutually agree on the required changes in APPENDIX C.\n\n          2.9. COMPONENTS FOR NICE INTERNAL REQUIREMENTS. Contractor will                occasionally provide services in order to help NICE to obtain                components for NICE' internal requirements. Contractor will allow                NICE to purchase reasonable quantities from its available                inventory at a price agreed in advance, and will help NICE to                obtain components from manufacturers/suppliers at the lowest                available price (in the case where the components in question are                not in the Contractor's inventory).\n\n          2.10. It is clarified that nothing in this Agreement shall prevent                NICE from contracting directly with Contractor's suppliers and                vendors in any agreement, or from purchasing identical                components, whether during this Agreement or following its                termination or expiration.\n\n     3.   ORDERING AND OTHER MATTERS\n\n          3.1. FORECASTS. NICE shall give Contractor a written forecast of the                Products, by type, quantity and expected Due Date (the                \"FORECAST\") as follows: A Forecast shall be a rolling forecast                for the current Quarter and the two (2) consecutive Quarters,                detailed by week. Upon the Effective Date, NICE shall deliver a                Forecast for the period commencing on the expected completion of                the Relocation Phase for the first Product, for the current                Quarter and for the next coming two Quarters and so on thereafter                during the term of this Agreement. The Forecast may be updated by                NICE on a weekly basis, or more frequently (at NICE' discretion).\n\n               A Forecast will not be deemed to constitute a binding purchase                order with respect to Products (as opposed to components and                sub-assemblies, as set forth in Sections 3.4, 16 and 17.5 of this                Agreement). Contractor will manufacture the quantities of                Products only according to specific orders and the Production                Lead Time. The\n\n                                       14\n\n               Parties' responsibilities and undertakings arising from NICE'                Forecast shall be according to APPENDIX C as amended from time to                time according to the provisions of this Agreement. Liability                reports will be submitted by Contractor on the 1st of each                calendar month and will need to be approved by NICE. It is                clarified for the avoidance of doubt, that in any event, any and                all purchase obligations of NICE with respect to Products (as                opposed to components and sub-assemblies) are limited in any                given time during the term of this Agreement, to the PO's only.\n\n               Contractor (with NICE' participation) will implement, at its own                expense, a full process of Demand Flow Technology, including: (I)                Product Synchronization; (II) Sequence of Events; (III) Mix                Model; (IV) Demand of Capacity & Take Time; (V) Operations                grouping; (VI) Line Design & Balancing. This process will help to                determine the Sub Assembly Lead Time and the Production Lead                Time. It is clarified that any change in the Production Lead Time                detailed in this Agreement shall require NICE' prior written                approval; any change in the Sub Assembly Lead Time detailed in                this Agreement as a result of which the maximum Sub Assembly Lead                Time for the relevant sub-assembly exceeds 30 Days, shall require                NICE' prior written approval.\n\n          3.2. PURCHASE ORDERS AND ISSUING ORDERS. NICE shall, from                time-to-time, issue to Contractor a Purchase Order, according to                the Forecast, for Products, by type, quantity and Due Date, as                and when it desires to order Products. PO's will be issued at                least two (2) weeks prior to the designated Due Date. Each and                every order will be entered in NICE' logistic system as a Sales                Order. Every Product shall be manufactured according to the                Production Lead Time. Commencement of assembly shall be based on                Production Lead Times (as per Section A (xvii)) and calculated to                meet NICE' delivery requirements. It is clarified that delivery                and shipment of Products and NICE' obligation to pay for Products                shall only be according to a PO.\n\n               Purchase Orders for Products (and Forecasts for Products) may be                delivered to Contractor by any reasonable means, including but                not limited to e-mail, computerized systems, etc., postal                delivery, courier delivery, facsimile transmission, as shall be                notified by NICE in writing and in advance of any relevant PO.                For the removal of doubt, a PO shall not be binding upon                Contractor until Contractor has confirmed in writing receipt of                the PO. Contractor shall, within two Business Days of its receipt                of a Purchase Order, accept or reject such Purchase Order in                writing; provided, however, that Contractor shall be obligated to\n\n\n\n\n\n               accept all Purchase Orders issued in accordance with the terms                hereof for Products with respect to which a price per the                quantity ordered has been mutually agreed by the parties.                Contractor undertakes that in the event of increase in Product                requirements VIS-A-VIS the Forecast (i.e. issuance of PO's                exceeding\n\n                                       15\n\n               the relevant Forecast), Contractor's manufacturing capacity can                be increased, at any time, by thirty percent (30%) beyond the                then current Forecast. In addition, in as much as purchase of                components and purchase of sub assemblies are concerned, NICE may                order Products, which are not included in the Forecast, and                Contractor will make its best reasonable commercial efforts to                accommodate such order in accordance with NICE' request. It is                clarified that in any event Contractor will accept all PO's                exceeding the Forecast, subject to updating the Due Date based                upon the Total Lead Time for obtaining the required components,                which are not available in Contractor's inventory. The Due Date                for such PO's will be determined according to the time of                obtaining the components. For components/Products the prices for                which are not previously agreed under APPENDIX C, the price will                be agreed in writing prior to acceptance of the PO.\n\n          3.3. FORECAST REVIEW. The parties shall hold weekly meetings, in                person, at NICE' facility or by conference phone call, for the                purpose of discussing NICE' existing and contemplated Forecasts                and order requirements and updating the Forecast; provided,                however, only written Forecasts and Purchase Orders, or written                modifications thereto, shall bind NICE and Contractor pursuant to                the terms of this Agreement or otherwise. The parties, as                business requirements dictate, may mutually agree upon the use of                blanket purchase orders for specific sub-assemblies or components                (exceeding the requirements under Forecasts), subject to the                terms of this Agreement and such sub-assemblies or components                purchased shall be deemed Permitted Components.\n\n          3.4. PERMITTED COMPONENTS. Contractor may make purchase commitments to                suppliers and assemble components to sub-assemblies based upon                the Forecasts received from NICE but subject always to the Total                Lead Time, Liability and ABC policies of Contractor (which NICE                will be entitled to review and comment on in advance of the                relevant purchase). Contractor shall maintain inventory of                Permitted Components (as defined below) for use during the                Production Lead Time. NICE shall only be obligated to Contractor                for components and sub-assemblies ordered and assembled by                Contractor, in accordance with the Forecast and in compliance                always with the Total Lead Time as detailed in APPENDIX C (as                amended from time to time according to this Agreement) or                otherwise for inventory of components purchased from NICE under                Sections 2.7 or 3.4(A), or purchased in accordance with POs,                ECO's or Change Orders (\"PERMITTED Components\"), as detailed                hereunder. It is clarified that any Forecast updated following                the purchase of Permitted Components will not affect their                definition as Permitted Components, and NICE' obligations with                respect thereto, subject to the Liability.\n\n               3.4(A) PURCHASE OF INVENTORY BY NICE.\n\n                                       16\n\n                    NICE will purchase from Contractor inventory of Permitted                     Components not required (in whole or in part) according to                     the Forecast for the Quarter immediately following the time                     at which such inventory is reviewed as detailed below                     (hereinafter: the \"FIRST QUARTER\") as detailed below. The                     following terms shall have the definitions ascribed thereto:\n\n                    (i)  DEAD INVENTORY - Permitted Components, the entire                          quantity of which is not required for assembly of                          Products in accordance with the Forecast.\n\n                    (ii) SLOW MOVING INVENTORY - Permitted Components, which are                          required for assembly of Products for the two                          consecutive Quarters commencing immediately after the                          First Quarter, in accordance with the Forecast.\n\n                    (iii) EXCESS INVENTORY - Permitted Components, which are                          required for assembly of Products only during the third                          Quarter after the First Quarter or thereafter, in                          accordance with the Forecast.\n\n                    Three (3) days before the beginning of every Quarter,                     Contractor will issue a report of Dead, Slow Moving and                     Excess Inventory, and shall detail the price of each                     Permitted Component included in the report as specified in                     APPENDIX C, which report will need to be verified by NICE                     within 2-3 days. Inthe event that in any Quarter, the Dead                     Inventory, Excess Inventory and Slow Moving Inventory                     together exceed 15% of the Monthly Consideration (as defined                     below), NICE will purchase such inventory exceeding 15% from                     Contractor one day before the beginning of the First                     Quarter, by payment of the price detailed in APPENDIX C\n\n\n\n\n\n                    including a surcharge of 4%. In calculating and determining                     the inventory falling within the said 15% (which shall not                     be purchased by NICE) the following priority shall apply:                     first - all Slow Moving Inventory, second (if not all 15%                     were covered) - all Excess Inventory, third (if not all 15%                     were covered) - Dead Inventory. The \"MONTHLY CONSIDERATION\"                     for the purpose hereof shall mean the total actual price due                     to Contractor from NICE hereunder for all Products during                     the preceding Quarter, divided by three (3).\n\n                    The foregoing shall apply only as of Q3 2002 - July 1st 2002                     (the first report of inventory as above shall be issued at                     the end of June 2002), and thereafter on a regular basis.\n\n                    In the event NICE has purchased any Permitted Component from                     Contractor as detailed above, Contractor is obligated to                     repurchase such Permitted Component for production of the                     next Forecast which requires such Permitted Component in                     accordance with the relevant procedure of Section 2.7 above                     (Nice Existing Inventory), at the price sold to NICE by                     Contractor excluding the surcharge of 4%.\n\n               No other compensation or components protection will be provided                by NICE except as explicitly detailed above or in Sections 16.7,                16.8 and 17.5 of this Agreement. Upon\n\n                                       17\n\n               payment of the aforementioned compensation for Permitted                Components, such items shall become the property of NICE, and                will be promptly delivered to NICE' facility in Israel, and, at                NICE' election and expense, shall be delivered to another                location in Israel identified to Contractor by NICE or, at NICE'                direction, disposed of by Contractor (in any manner selected by                Contractor). In any event, Contractor will make best reasonable                commercial efforts to decrease levels of inventory of Permitted                Components, by agreeing with its suppliers to decrease Purchase                Lead Times to 1 - 2 weeks at the most.\n\n          3.5. CHANGE ORDERS. Throughout all the assembly phases of a Product                during the Production Lead Time and any time before the Due Date,                NICE may issue Contractor with a Change Order. The issuance of                such Change Order and the execution by Contractor of such Change                Order, shall be in accordance with the provisions hereunder. Upon                issuance of a Change Order, Contractor will immediately execute                it and the Product price shall change in accordance with APPENDIX                C. The sole implication of a Change Order will be payment for                additional direct labor costs as detailed in APPENDIX C. Replaced                components and sub-assemblies will be returned to Contractor's                inventory at no charge to NICE (without derogating from the                specific provisions of this Agreement under which NICE is                obligated to purchase Permitted Components). The Product price                will be as after the implementation of the Change Order. For                Change Orders issued prior to commencement of the Production Lead                Time for any Product no charge will be incurred by NICE. Without                derogating from the aforementioned, Contractor will not charge                NICE for Change Orders during the first three (3) months of                production.\n\n          3.6. RESCHEDULING OF RELEASED ORDERS. NICE may, at its discretion,                reschedule delivery of units of Products for which a PO has                already been issued, by shortening the Due Date, without any                implication. In this respect, Contractor is aware that by the                last three weeks of every calendar Quarter, a high level of                flexibility is required to meet NICE' end of Quarter                requirements. Contractor will perform its best reasonable                commercial efforts to complete such rescheduled Products at the                new requested Due Date. All such rescheduling shall be performed                by sending Contractor a written request for rescheduling.\n\n          3.7. ORDERS ON HOLD. Prior to the Due Date, NICE may, at its                discretion, place Products manufactured according to PO's on hold                for a period not to exceed thirty (30) Days from the Due Date,                without any implications, by giving a written notice to                Contractor. Upon termination of such 30 Day period or earlier if                requested by NICE in writing, the Products on hold will be deemed                as cancelled and the provisions of Section 3.8 below shall apply.\n\n          3.8. CANCELLATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS. NICE may at its discretion, at                any time, cancel, in whole or in part, PO's of Products issued\n\n                                       18\n\n               pursuant to this Agreement subject to the delivery of prior                written notice, before the respective Due Date. Contractor, upon                receipt of such written notice of cancellation, shall stop work                on such units of Products if work has already commenced. Without                derogating from any liability to pay for Permitted Components as                set forth elsewhere in specific provisions this Agreement, NICE                shall have no liability for cancellation of a PO prior to the                Production Lead Time of the Product. For cancellation of a PO                during the Production Lead Time and until the Due Date, NICE'                liability for cancellation shall be limited to the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n               3.8.1. Payment of a fixed cancellation charge for all cancelled                     units of Products as specified in APPENDIX C. The fixed                     cancellation charge will be recalculated at the end of the                     first Quarter, based on the actual average time to                     disassemble a Product, as determined by Contractor and                     agreed to by NICE;\n\n               3.8.2. All the components/sub-assemblies will be returned to                     Contractor's inventory at no charge to NICE subject to and                     in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\n\n               3.8.3. NICE shall not be responsible and shall not pay, in whole                     or in part, for Products manufactured outside the agreed                     Production Lead Time and/or without a written NICE Purchase                     Order.\n\n          3.9. Contractor shall use its best reasonable commercial efforts to                minimize Change Order charges and cancellation charges by                returning components for credit (with NICE' approval), canceling                components on order and applying components to other Contractor                projects (when possible, at the sole discretion of Contractor)                and minimizing all work-in-process.\n\n          3.10. ENGINEERING CHANGE REQUESTS (ECR'S). NICE shall be entitled, at                its sole discretion, from time to time to request any Engineering                Change Requests for any Product and Contractor is obligated to                propose ECR's to NICE when applicable at Contractor's opinion.                Contractor will respond to all Engineering Change Requests                initiated by NICE, according to the terms hereof. Contractor will                give NICE written notice, within three (3) Business Days of                receiving written notice of such ECR, of the date by which, and                at what cost, such ECR could be implemented based on the pricing                formula in APPENDIX C, and how the ECR effects existing PO's.                Contractor will charge NICE for ECR's in accordance with APPENDIX                C (an administrative cost of $25 per ECR of whatever size).\n\n          3.11. ENGINEERING CHANGE ORDERS (ECO'S). NICE may, at its discretion,                issue ECO's based on Contractor's response to the ECR's or based                on negotiated changes to Contractor's response. The                administrative cost for an ECO shall be $50 per ECO. Engineering                Change Orders effective dates (the date for completion of                implementation\n\n                                       19\n\n               of the ECO) shall be as agreed to by the parties and shall effect                the relevant Lead Times and dates accordingly, as detailed in the                ECO. Contractor shall approve every ECO issued as above within 2                Business Days. An ECO shall become binding on Contractor upon                written confirmation of receipt thereby. Contractor shall not                make any design changes or any other changes in the Products                without the prior written consent of NICE as reflected in an ECO.                The new Product price due to an Engineering Change Order, shall                be determined in accordance with APPENDIX C. Contractor shall                make all reasonable commercial efforts to minimize costs due to                ECO's. Notwithstanding the aforementioned in Sections 3.10. and                3.11., NICE shall not be charged for the first $1,000 due to                Contractor in any one month for ECR's and ECO's.\n\n          3.12. DISASSEMBLY OF PRODUCTS. From time to time, NICE may order                Contractor to disassemble Products after the Due Date. Upon such                request issued to Contractor, it shall promptly comply with the                request. Dismantled components will be consigned to Contractor's                inventory and stored in a special warehouse at Contractor's                facility, at no charge to NICE (the \"RETURNED COMPONENTS\"). NICE                will pay Contractor the original Product price and also a fixed                fee for dismantling as detailed in APPENDIX C. Thereafter,                Contractor will use the Returned Components first in the assembly                of any Products until no inventory of Returned Components                remains. Contractor will not charge NICE for any surcharge or                overhead for use of Returned Components in a Product.\n\n          3.13. SPARE PART MECHANISM. In addition to producing Products                hereunder, and in addition to Contractor's responsibilities under                its warranty obligation hereunder which are included in the                Product price as provided herein, Contractor will supply Spare                Parts to Customers upon request, as detailed in APPENDIX I                according to the applicable Production Lead Time. The price for                spare parts shall be in accordance with APPENDIX C and shall be                paid by NICE in accordance herewith.\n\n     4.   SCOPE; NEW PRODUCTS\n\n          4.1. The scope of this Agreement refers to the Products currently                detailed in APPENDIX A subject to the provisions of APPENDIX K.                The Manufacturing Outsourcing Services will be performed by                Contractor on a gradual basis as detailed hereinabove, and until                full performance of the Manufacturing Outsourcing Services by                Contractor for all Products.\n\n          4.2. Quotations by Contractor for new Products will be developed by                NICE in coordination with Contractor subject to the mutually                agreed upon pricing model set forth in APPENDIX C hereto. Other                terms applicable to new Products shall be identical to those                applicable to the current Products. Each such quotation requested\n\n\n\n\n\n               by NICE shall be provided to NICE on an expeditious basis.                Contractor shall develop a mutually agreeable quality program for                each new Product. The provisions of APPENDIX K - NICE Systems                Products Release Policy will apply to such new Products subject                to the terms hereof.\n\n5.   DUE DATE\n\n                                       20\n\n          5.1. Contractor shall target 100% on time delivery in compliance with                the Due Date. Contractor's performance regarding the Due Date                shall constitute a material obligation, and is an essential                element in this Agreement.\n\n          5.2. DELAYS. Immediately upon learning of any possible delays,                Contractor will notify NICE as to the cause and extent of such                delay. Contractor shall at once, exercise its best reasonable                commercial measures to minimize the possible delay, at no                additional cost to NICE. Such measures may include, inter alia,                acceleration of payments to Contractor's vendors if necessary.\n\n          5.3. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. Any delay from the Due Date of a certain                Product in a certain Quarter, not due to a specific written                request by NICE or otherwise deriving from a breach of NICE'                undertakings hereunder and only to the extent deriving from such                breach by NICE, or caused by an event of Force Majeure, and                subject to the terms hereof, shall be considered a material                breach of Contractor's obligations under this Agreement and shall                entitle NICE to the following liquidated damages in addition to                any remedy available to NICE under this Agreement or by law:\n\n               5.3.1.

Three percent (3%) of the Product Price for a delay of up                     to 10 Days.\n\n               5.3.3. Five percent (5%) of the Product Price for a delay of 11                     Days or more.\n\n               5.3.4. For the removal of doubt, when determining the liquidated                     damages due, the applicable sub-section 5.3.1, 5.3.2 OR                     5.3.3 will apply. In any event, the total liquidated damages                     as per this Section shall not exceed 5% of the Product                     Price.\n\n               5.3.5 The \"PRODUCT PRICE\" for the purpose of this Section 5.3.                     shall mean the total consideration which is due to                     Contractor for the Products being delayed at the relevant                     time.\n\n               5.3.6. In the event that following the delay, Contractor is in                     compliance with the Due Dates for two immediately                     consecutive Quarters and there is no delay whatsoever,                     Contractor will be reimbursed by NICE for liquidated damages                     already paid for delay in the previous Quarter (before the                     said 2 Quarters), if paid, without derogating from the                     previous delay being regarded as a breach hereunder.\n\n               5.3.7 NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR DUE DATE. Notwithstanding the                     aforementioned, Contractor shall be relived from its                     responsibility for the Due Date of any specific Product if                     all the following terms are met:\n\n                    (1)  Contractor notifies Nice promptly in writing of the                          delay and the detailed reasons for the delay;\n\n                    (2)  Contractor proves that such delay was caused by a                          worldwide event of component allocation or a worldwide                          event of Force Majeure (as defined in this Agreement)                          applying to a manufacturer of necessary components                          required for assembly of the Product and such                          components can not be purchased from another                          manufacturer, since the manufacturer with which                          Contractor has contracted (directly or through                          suppliers) is a single source manufacturer worldwide                          or, if there is more than one source - the above                          applies to all of them;\n\n                                       21\n\n                    (3)  Contractor proves, that it has employed all necessary                          measures, both upon contracting with the supplier                          (including but not limited to - contracting other                          suppliers) and after becoming aware of the delay, in                          order to ensure proper timely delivery by such supplier                          and in accordance with the agreed Purchase Lead Time in                          this Agreement;\n\n                    (4)  Contractor takes all required actions in order to                          minimize the effects of such occurrence and solve it.\n\n6.   SHIPMENT DATE, PACKING AND SHIPPING\n\n\n\n\n\n          6.1. PACKING. Contractor shall package each unit of Product according                to the standard NICE packing procedure and specifications in                accordance with the PDM System, or, if not specified by NICE,                according to good commercial standards. Every shipment to a NICE                Customer must include a Packing List issued by the Contractor,                attached to the packed Product. The Packing List is derived from                the Purchase Order and includes all the packed items in the                carton and all software licenses associated with the Product.\n\n          6.2. PREPARATION OF EXPORT SHIPMENTS. Contractor will be responsible                for preparing the shipment of the final Product to the Customer                by arranging the pallets and packing them according to NICE'                instructions as set forth in the PDM System.\n\n          6.3. DELIVERY. Unless agreed otherwise in the future, Contractor will                deliver finished Products to NICE' designated freight forwarder,                at Contractor's premises.\n\n          6.4. SHIPMENT DATES. The following Shipment dates shall apply:                Shipment plans that Contractor receives until 13:00, will be                ready until the end of the same Day (except that on weekend days                prior coordination will be required); Shipment plans that                Contractor receives after 13:00, will be ready until the end of                the next Day (except that on weekend days prior coordination will                be required).\n\n               Contractor's performance regarding the Shipment Date shall                constitute a material obligation, and is an essential element in                this Agreement.\n\n          6.5. INSPECTION. Products will be subject to inspection by NICE, or by                certified NICE' distributors according to the following                provisions, both prior to the Shipment Date while they are in the                finished goods warehouse and after the Shipment Date. During the                inspection, NICE may open cartons and boxes and unpack the                contents for inspection. An inspection will be coordinated if                possible. NICE may inform the Contractor if there is any mismatch                in Product quantities or if any damage was caused to the shipment                prior to delivery to NICE' freight forwarder in Contractor's                facility. In case of a quantity mismatch between the quantity                recorded on the packing documents and the actual quantity                received, NICE will notify Contractor\n\n                                       22\n\n               of the mismatch, and, subject to verification by Contractor,                Contractor will complete the missing quantity. In case where a                shipment is found damaged prior to delivery to NICE' freight                forwarder at Contractor's facility, the Contractor will replace                or repair the Product and deliver it back to such NICE' freight                forwarder at Contractor's facility, at Contractor's expense. If                there was no mismatch in quantities or no damage to the shipment                (as applicable), NICE will bear all risk and costs associated                with the delivery of shipment to Contractor and back.\n\n7.   [DELETED]\n\n8.   PAYMENTS\n\n          8.1. Initial prices as proposed in the Proposal are set out in                APPENDIX C. Within one month from signature of this Agreement,                the parties will amend the initial APPENDIX C according to                components purchase prices and supplier agreements obtained by                Contractor, but in no event will the relevant data exceed the                data included in the initial APPENDIX C, except with respect to                components sold to Contractor by NICE according to APPENDIX F and                Section 2.7, or further to changes in APPENDIX C made pursuant to                NICE' instructions under Sections 2.2, 2.3 or 2.4 of this                Agreement. Contractor will use reasonable commercial efforts to                improve the particulars in APPENDIX C and, amongst others,                shorten Liability. In the event of lack of agreement on the                amended APPENDIX C within one month from the signature date, the                initial Appendix C shall continue to apply until agreed                otherwise. It is clarified that labor prices in APPENDIX C will                not be amended as aforementioned regarding components. Contractor                hereby declares and undertakes that the details included in                APPENDIX C(as amended from time to time according to the                provisions of this Agreement) shall be the accurate details from                all of the relevant purchase agreements of Contractor with its                suppliers and components and sub assembly prices in APPENDIX C                shall be net purchase prices by Contractor without any overhead                or uplift. Thereafter, prices may be decreased or increased                according to the formula and at the timetables detailed herein                below.\n\n          8.2. COST ADJUSTMENTS. Product pricing shall remain firm for Products                for each Quarter, except as follows or as set forth in Sections,                2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.5, 3.8, 3.11, 8.1, 8.3, and hereunder in the                various subsections of Section 8.2:\n\n               8.2.1. The quoted cost of all components and sub-assemblies in                     each Product subject to this Agreement is or will be set                     forth in APPENDIX C or an agreed written amendment thereto.\n\n               8.2.2. NICE and Contractor shall continually work to introduce\n\n\n\n\n\n                    new cost reduction methods.\n\n                                       23\n\n                    Contractor shall make its best reasonable commercial efforts                     to reduce the cost of manufacturing Products, by methods                     such as elimination of components, obtaining alternate                     sources of materials, redefinition of specifications, and                     improved assembly or test methods, subject to NICE' written                     approval. Upon implementation of such methods initiated by                     Contractor, Contractor will enjoy one hundred percent (100%)                     of the cost reduction during the first Quarter and                     thereafter will reduce the price accordingly so that NICE                     will enjoy one hundred percent (100%) of the cost reduction.                     NICE will immediately enjoy one hundred percent (100%) of                     the cost reduction upon implementation of such methods                     initiated by NICE.\n\n               8.2.3. In the event there is a decrease in the cost of a                     component or sub-assembly purchased by Contractor for the                     purposes hereof, which affects the purchase price of such                     Product, Contractor shall document such decrease in costs                     and provide such information to NICE in writing, in                     reasonable detail, within three (3) Business Days of                     Contractor becoming aware of such decrease.\n\n               8.2.4. In case of a decrease as aforementioned, the purchase                     prices in APPENDIX C for units of the affected Product shall                     be adjusted accordingly.\n\n               8.2.5. In the event there is an increase in the cost of a                     Permitted Component purchased/to be purchased by Contractor                     for the purposes hereof, which affects the purchase price of                     such Product, Contractor shall provide NICE with copies of                     letters as elaborated below, together with a request for a                     \"price increase\" within one (1) Business Days of Contractor                     becoming aware of such increase. Contractor shall not                     purchase any such component until NICE approves it in                     writing. NICE shall approve/disapprove on the same Business                     Day it was notified by Contractor provided notice was                     received by 12:00. However, NICE may only reject a price                     increase if it can show that the Permitted Component is                     available at the a lower price. There are two permitted                     types of price increases:\n\n                    (i)  TEMPORARY PRICE INCREASE designated to meet the                          requested Due Date, in the event of receiving a                          Purchase Order/Forecast for which the Purchase Lead                          Time is shorter than the normal Purchase Lead Time of                          the relevant components detailed in APPENDIX C or due                          to an Engineering Change Order which affects the Due                          Date. Contractor shall provide NICE with copies of                          letters of approach to at least 3 suppliers that are                          known in the market and accepted commonly (if 3                          suppliers exist for such component) and their response.                          In such event, NICE will pay Contractor the difference                          between the original price and the actual price for                          those components purchased after the increase.\n\n                                       24\n\n                    (ii) CONSTANT PRICE INCREASE caused by a change in the                          market trend. Market trend increase requests will be                          explained by providing NICE with copies of letters of                          approach to at least 3 suppliers that are known in the                          market and accepted commonly (if 3 suppliers exist),                          and their response. NICE will pay Contractor the                          difference between the original price and the actual                          price for those components purchased after the increase                          within the Quarter, and thereafter APPENDIX C shall be                          updated accordingly.\n\n          8.3. COST REVIEW. During each calendar Quarter, no later than the                third week of the Quarter, the parties will jointly review the                costs, costs reduction, volume performance of Contractor and                NICE, respectively, and other performance parameters to be                mutually agreed upon by the parties. The pricing and other                details referenced in APPENDIX C shall be jointly reviewed by the                parties at an agreed upon frequency and may be modified with the                mutual written agreement of the parties.\n\n          8.4.

Contractor hereby warrants to NICE that it has the full corporate                power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform                its obligations hereunder; that no impediment exists to                Contractor entering into this Agreement, and no other agreement                has been or will be made with any third party which will have a                detrimental effect on Contractor's ability to fulfill its                obligations under this Agreement.\n\n          9.2. Contractor hereby warrants to NICE that it has ascertained the                nature of the Manufacturing Outsourcing Services and its own                ability to perform such Manufacturing Outsourcing Services, and                that all Manufacturing Outsourcing Services provided by                Contractor hereunder will be performed in a professional and                workmanlike manner by a sufficient number of individuals with                appropriate skills and training for the applicable task using                systems and processes which are sufficient to accomplish the                Contractor performance\n\n                                       26\n\n               obligations under this Agreement. In addition, without derogating                from any undertaking, warranty or representation of NICE included                in the Agreement, Contractor acknowledges and agrees that prior                to the entering into this Agreement it has had the ability to                perform a due diligence investigation into the manufacturing,                production, testing and delivery as performed by NICE up to and                including the date hereof, that it has in fact performed such an                investigation and that based upon the outcome thereof, it                believes that it has the professional and other capabilities to                perform the Manufacturing Outsourcing Services as set forth                herein in a professional and workmanlike manner.\n\n          9.3. Contractor further warrants that it is duly licensed, authorized,                or qualified to do business and in good standing in every                jurisdiction in which a license, authorization, or qualification                is required for the ownership or leasing of its assets, of the                transactions of business of the character transacted by it except                where the failure to be so licensed, authorized, or qualified                would not have a material adverse effect on Contractor's ability                to fulfill is obligations under this Agreement.\n\n          9.4. PRODUCT WARRANTY. Contractor warrants to NICE that each of the                Products manufactured, configured or tested by Contractor will                have been manufactured, configured and tested in conformance with                the Specifications therefor as provided by NICE and be free from                defects in workmanship or material for the Warranty Period. It is\n\n\n\n\n\n               clarified for the avoidance of doubt, that the aforesaid warranty                of Contractor for the Products applies to the entire Product,                including components and workmanship, except when the defect or                malfunction results from the design, NICE Software or the Nice                Components supplied by NICE under this Agreement if Contractor                cannot obtain warranty service for same from the supplier (and                Contractor shall notify NICE accordingly), for which NICE shall                be responsible.\n\n          9.5. Contractor shall be responsible for procurement of components as                set forth herein, inspection of components, and safe handling of                the components while in-house at Contractor's premises.\n\n          9.6. RMA. Should a Product fail to be in conformity with the above                warranties during the Warranty Period, NICE shall deliver the                Product to Contractor at its expense, Contractor shall repair or                replace the Product at no charge (as set forth in Section 9.7                below), and will cover all shipment and delivery costs of                therepaired or replaced Product from Contractor's facility to                NICE' Customer location (whether in Israel or abroad). In the                case that the determination according to Section 9.9 below, is                that Contractor's warranty hereunder does not apply, NICE will                bare all shipment and delivery costs of the Product/s and their                return, and of any repair/replacement costs if requested by NICE,                according to APPENDIX C. Detailed procedures to be executed by                Contractor concerning the repair of defective/malfunctioning                Products subject to the warranty hereunder are included in                APPENDIX N - Return Material Authorization (\"RMA\").\n\n                                       27\n\n          9.7. WARRANTY SERVICE. Contractor shall replace any such Product with                a new Product except when the defect is in the NICE proprietary                boards, in which case Contractor may repair the Product.                Contractor will deliver the repaired or replacement unit to NICE,                within seven (7) Days of Contractor's receipt of such Product or                parts thereof. NICE may require a shorter repair and replacement                time for up to ten percent (10%) of the returned Products for                warranty service, and Contractor shall use its best reasonable                commercial efforts to accommodate same.\n\n               NICE shall provide Contractor a spares forecast for warranty                requirements for the period up and until July 1, 2002. If during                such period, the spare parts required for warranty service alone                exceed the spares forecast provided by NICE, NICE shall sell                Contractor the missing spares at the prices specified in APPENDIX                C. Nevertheless, NICE shall have no liability in the event the                spares forecast exceeds the actual spares used during that                period. As of July 1, 2002 purchasing of spares in order to                comply with the warranty obligations shall be the sole                responsibility of Contractor and no forecast shall be provided.\n\n               On or about July 1, 2002 the parties will review the said 7 days                timetable, and any changes in such timetable shall need to be                agreed in advance in writing, both Parties acting reasonably and                in good faith. Nothing contained in the foregoing shall obligate                NICE to change such warranty timetable since its Customer                obligations are dependent on it.\n\n               The units of Products for which action may be required under this                warranty shall be returned to Contractor's manufacturing                facility, at NICE' expense, with an accompanying Contractor                supplied RMA and correction / replacement time shall commence                upon return of the defective Product to Contractor's facility.                The RMA will include a packing slip only and will not include an                invoice.\n\n          9.8. ADVANCED RMA. From time to time, NICE may request that the                Contractor supply RMA to NICE Customers prior to receipt by                Contractor of the failed Products. In such event, replacement                time shall be 7 Days of receipt of the RMA and NICE will be                responsible for the return of the failed Product or parts                thereof, respectively, to the Contractor within sixty (60) Days                from the delivery of the said RMA. If the failed Product is not                returned within same period, Contractor shall invoice NICE for                the replaced Product supplied.\n\n          9.9. DETERMINING DEFECT SOURCE. NICE and Contractor will use their                best commercial efforts to determine whether a defect in a unit                of Product exists and the reason for such defect. In the event of                dispute\n\n                                       28\n\n               whether the source of a defect is subject to Contractor's                warranty as detailed in Section 9.4, the parties will assign a                joint MRB (Material Review Board) team to determine the source of                defect, whose decisions must be mutually agreed to by both                parties. NICE shall perform any investigation/examination                reasonably requested by Contractor. In the event that the joint                MRB team can not reach a mutually agreed decision, Contractor                shall be deemed responsible for the warranty repair or                replacement, unless Contractor proves otherwise, and NICE shall                supply Contractor with all necessary information to assist in\n\n\n\n\n\n               such determination. It is clarified that in the event of a                dispute as aforementioned regarding the source of a defect,                Contractor shall, nevertheless, continue its warranty obligations                in a timely manner and will not withhold delivery of repaired and                replaced Products, but may demand further investigation by the                MRB team as above.\n\n          9.10. WARRANTIES PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES. If and to the extent                warranties provided by third parties for components or                sub-assemblies (forming an integral part of the defective Product                sold to NICE hereunder) that Contractor/anyone on its behalf                purchases under this Agreement, exceed the Warranty Period                hereunder, Contractor shall ensure that NICE will benefit from                such warranties included in agreements with suppliers as detailed                in Section 2.2 above and use its best reasonable commercial                efforts so that NICE may benefit from such warranties included in                agreements with suppliers as detailed in Section 2 above, at                Contractors' expense. Contractor will cooperate with NICE in its                efforts to exercise its rights under such warranties for their                entire duration. The aforementioned shall apply both during and                after the term of this Agreement.\n\n          9.11 POST-WARRANTY RMA. Contractor shall provide post-Warranty RMA                services to NICE in accordance with the procedures in APPENDIX N                and the prices in APPENDIX C.\n\n9A.  NICE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES\n\n     9A.1. NICE hereby warrants to Contractor that it has the full corporate           power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform its           obligations hereunder; that no impediment exists to NICE entering into           this Agreement, and no other agreement has been or will be made with           any third party which will have a detrimental effect on NICE' ability           to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n     9A.2 NICE hereby warrants to Contractor that it has the financial ability           to perform its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n                                       29\n\n10.  AUDIT AND ACCESS\n\n     10.1. REPORTS. Contractor shall provide to NICE periodical reports in the           format acceptable by NICE and agreed by Contractor, which shall be           submitted each week, unless agreed otherwise in writing. In addition,           NICE may request other reports pertaining to the Outsourcing           Manufacturing Services and Contractor will promptly comply with such           requests, to the extent reasonable.\n\n     10.2. GENERAL. NICE shall have the rights to conduct audits of the           Manufacturing Outsourcing Services and related facilities, systems,           and records as set forth in this Section 10 for the purpose of           auditing Contractor's compliance with the provisions of this           Agreement, all subject to the limitations below. The audits shall           include the physical equipment designated for the Manufacturing           Outsourcing Services provided hereunder, the facility at Contractors'           premises designated for the Manufacturing Outsourcing Services           including the finished goods warehouse, the inventory designated for           the Manufacturing Outsourcing Services provided hereunder and any           records, supporting documentation, equipment and information           pertaining solely to NICE and this Agreement, provided that with           regard to records pertaining to inventory/components, in addition to           the particulars detailed in Sections 2.2 and 2.3, NICE will have           access to the ERP system at Contractor's facility only (including for           the avoidance of doubt, the modules of the ERP system dealing with           invoices and invoicing). No documents or data of any kind, or any           copies, may be removed from Contractor's facility and all audits shall           be performed within such facility only.\n\n     10.3. Such audits are expected to occur frequently given the significant           security and business practices concerns inherent in the Manufacturing           Outsourcing Services and NICE shall have the sole discretion, not to           be unreasonably applied, to determine the frequency. NICE agrees to           conduct the audits in a reasonable manner so as not to cause undue           disruption to Contractor's provision of the Manufacturing Outsourcing           Services and such audits shall be conducted during business hours, and           shall be coordinated with Contractor. In the course of such audits           Contractor shall provide, and shall cause its Permitted Subcontractors           to provide, such auditors any reasonable assistance that they may           require. Such reasonable assistance shall be provided as part of the           Manufacturing Outsourcing Services.\n\n     10.4. If any audit by an auditor designated by NICE results in Contractor           being notified that it or its Permitted Subcontractors are not in           compliance with any law or regulation, Contractor shall, and shall           cause its Permitted Subcontractors to, take actions to comply with           such law or regulation, at Contractor's or its Permitted           Subcontractor's expense.\n\n                                       30\n\n     10.5. RESULTS OF AUDITS. If, as a result of an audit, NICE determines that           Contractor has undercharged or overcharged NICE, NICE shall notify           Contractor in writing of the amount of such undercharge or overcharge,\n\n\n\n\n\n          and shall specify the relevant data and the reasoning for its           determination. If Contractor agrees in writing, an appropriate           adjustment shall promptly be paid to NICE or Contractor. In the event           Contractor believes that it has complied with the relevant law,           regulation or this Agreement, and has not overcharged or undercharged           NICE, it shall so notify NICE in writing upon receipt of NICE' audit           results shall specify the relevant data and the reasoning for its           determination and the parties will attempt to determine the issue in           mutual consent.\n\n     10.6. CONTRACTOR RECORD RETENTION AND ACCESS. As part of the Manufacturing           Outsourcing Services, Contractor shall (1) retain records and           supporting documentation detailed in Section 10.2 above if and to the           extent such record retention is required by tax or similar           authorities, and/or exists in the ERP system, and/or is common           practice in the industry, including but not limited to - production           files for the following periods: 7 years for records required by tax           or similar authorities and ERP data, 3 years for production files,           otherwise as required by law or as is the common practice, and (2)           upon notice of no less than five (5) Days from NICE, provide NICE and           its designees with reasonable access to such records and documentation           for the purpose of conducting NICE' business and reporting. Such           access shall only be provided to audit personnel who have signed           towards Contractor a non-disclosure undertaking incorporating terms           which are substantially the same as those in APPENDIX E.\n\n     10.7 All audits of all kind by NICE shall be subject to the confidentiality           obligations of NICE to Contractor detailed in this Agreement.\n\n11.  SAFETY AND SECURITY, FACILITIES, NON-GENERIC EQUIPMENT\n\n     11.1. SAFETY AND SECURITY.

APPROVAL OF LOCATION. NICE shall have the right to approve or           disqualify each location at which Contractor is providing any of its           services hereunder. Contractor agrees that the Manufacturing           Outsourcing Services will be performed in a dedicated space in           Contractor's facility in which no production of competing products           will be conducted. Access to the NICE production lines will be limited           only to Contractor's employees performing the Manufacturing           Outsourcing Services and NICE representatives.\n\n     11.5. NON GENERIC EQUIPMENT. During the term of this Agreement, the Non           Generic Equipment shall be furnished to Contractor (without charge)           and used in Contractor's premises for purposes of performing its           various obligations under this Agreement, according to the terms           hereof. Such Non Generic Equipment shall:\n\n          (1)  Be clearly marked and identified as NICE' property.\n\n          (2)  Be safely stored, adequately maintained and insured against loss                or damage under Contractor's existing policies detailed in                APPENDIX D. In the event such Non Generic Equipment is damaged,                lost or destroyed, Contractor shall be liable towards NICE to                repair or replace such equipment (at Contractor's choice).\n\n          (3)  Remain the sole property of NICE, and therefore shall be kept                free of liens and encumbrances imposed on Contractor's property.\n\n          (4)  Be returned to NICE upon request, or upon termination of this                Agreement, at the same condition as originally furnished to                Contractor except for normal wear and tear. Notwithstanding                anything to contrary, if NICE requests to have the Non Generic                Equipment returned thereto prior to the termination of the                relevant services hereunder, Contractor shall have no liability                or obligation for the performance of any obligations hereunder                for which such Non Generic Equipment is reasonably required.                Contractor shall notify NICE in writing in detail of the                aforementioned, promptly upon NICE' request to receive the Non                Generic Equipment.\n\n          (5)  Be used according to NICE' written instructions and information                concerning such Non Generic Equipment.\n\n          (6)  Shall not be used by Contractor for any other purpose except for                NICE' needs and shall be dedicated for performance of this                Agreement.\n\n          (7)  Nevertheless, NICE may request Contractor to purchase some Non                Generic Equipment by itself and in such event Contractor shall\n\n\n\n\n\n               invoice NICE for the purchase price. Such equipment shall be                deemed for all purposes as part of the \"Non Generic Equipment\"                and shall be sold to NICE upon termination of this Agreement for                any reason, at a total sale price of 1$.\n\n                                       32\n\n12.

Contractor shall use the same           degree of care with respect to NICE Proprietary Information as it uses           in protecting its own proprietary information and trade secrets.\n\n          Without derogating from the aforementioned, Contractor shall not, in           any way or manner, directly or indirectly, engineer, reverse engineer,           compile, decompile or reverse assemble the NICE Software, or analyze           or otherwise examine the NICE Software for the purpose of reverse           engineering.\n\n     12.3. In addition, Contractor shall not disclose the NICE Proprietary           Information to any Personnel, except on a need to know basis as           required in order to implement this Agreement. Contractor undertakes           to procure that its Personnel and Permitted Subcontractors engaged in           performance of this Agreement (except subcontractor's employees who do           not have access to the NICE production lines at Contractor's           premises), and reasonably designated by NICE in advance in writing,           have signed a non-disclosure agreement in the form of APPENDIX E,           prior to receipt of any NICE Proprietary Information.\n\n                                       33\n\n          12.3A Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Contractor shall have                no liability with respect to disclosure of NICE Proprietary                Information if such information came into the possession of the                Contractor independently of this Agreement, through a breach of                obligation of secrecy of a third party to NICE, of which                Contractor was not aware and should not have been aware if                Contractor had exercised due care.\n\n     12.4. CONFIDENTIALITY BY NICE. NICE shall not: transfer to others, copy or           duplicate, sub-license sell, publish, display or otherwise make           available in any form or disclose, the Contractor's Proprietary           Information, to any third party, except for the purpose of performing           this Agreement. NICE shall use the same degree of care with respect to           such Contractor's Proprietary Information as it uses in protecting its           own proprietary information and trade secrets. All rights in           Contractor's Proprietary Information, shall remain solely with           Contractor. Notwithstanding the aforesaid, it is agreed that any           manufacturing methods applied by Contractor, which are Contractor's           Proprietary Information, may be used by NICE itself (including its           Affiliates) (but may not be transferred/disclosed to any third party)           and by signing this Agreement Contractor hereby grants NICE a           personal, non exclusive, non transferable, perpetual license to use           such manufacturing methods.\n\n          12.4A Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, NICE shall have no                liability with respect to disclosure of Contractor Proprietary                Information if such information came into the possession of NICE                independently of this Agreement, through a breach of obligation                of secrecy of a third party to Contractor, of which NICE was not                aware and should not have been aware if NICE had exercised due                care.\n\n     12.5. LEGAL OBLIGATION TO DISCLOSE. In the event a party is required to           disclose Proprietary Information of the other party, by applicable law\n\n\n\n\n\n          or by any government in the exercise of its lawful authority, the           party so required shall (i) promptly notify the other party in           writing, and, at the other party's expense: (ii) use reasonable and           lawful efforts to resist making any disclosure of Proprietary           Information not approved by the other party, (iii) use reasonable and           lawful efforts to limit the amount of Proprietary Information to be           disclosed pursuant to any such disclosure, and (iv) cooperate with the           other party to obtain a protective order or other appropriate relief           to minimize the further dissemination of any Proprietary Information           to be disclosed pursuant to any such disclosure.\n\n     12.6. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNIFICATION BY CONTRACTOR. Contractor shall           indemnify, hold harmless and defend NICE from and against any and all           damages (including all damages awarded to a third party and payable by           NICE), costs, losses, and expenses (including settlement awards and           reasonable attorney's fees) arising from any claim or suit made           against NICE or a third party which NICE is obligated to indemnify, by           a third party based on the allegation that the Products infringe or           violate any Intellectual Property right due to the components and/or           sub assemblies supplied by Contractor hereunder and/or the           manufacturing processes and methods as performed by Contractor           hereunder. Contractor shall include in all its agreements with           suppliers/ manufacturers provisions regarding Intellectual Property           indemnification substantially similar to those included in this           Agreement, providing inter alia that they are freely assignable to           NICE without any modification or consent.\n\n                                       34\n\n          Nevertheless, in the event NICE designates specific components to be           purchased by Contractor hereunder and the manufacturer/supplier of           such NICE designated components refuses to grant Contractor           indemnification for infringement of Intellectual Property rights,           despite Contractor performing its best reasonable commercial efforts           to obtain such indemnification (which Contractor shall prove to NICE           by submission of copies of its correspondence with the manufacturer           including the manufacturer's response), then if NICE approves purchase           of such components, Contractor shall not be responsible for           Intellectual Property indemnification due to those specific           components.\n\n          For the removal of doubt, Contractor shall not be liable for any           infringement of an Intellectual Property right due to any NICE           Proprietary Information, NICE Intellectual Property, NICE Software,           Non Generic Equipment (if used in accordance with the instructions           provided by NICE), and due to performance as is of NICE written           instructions including specifications and design.\n\n               Contractor's indemnification as provided under this Section shall                apply only if: Contractor is notified promptly in writing of any                notice of a claim or of a threatened or actual suit; and is given                control of the defense thereof and all related settlement                negotiations; and, NICE provides, at Contractor's request and                expense, all reasonable cooperation and assistance for the                defense and negotiations of the claim. Nevertheless, in the event                the claim or suit is based on the allegation that the Products                infringe or violate any Intellectual Property right due to the                components and/or sub assemblies supplied by Contractor hereunder                which were designated by Nice as aforementioned, and the supplier                / manufacturer of the infringing component has an indemnity                undertaking as above towards Contractor; (i) which is assignable                to NICE and Contractor promptly assigns to NICE such                indemnification undertaking from its supplier / manufacturer;                (ii) which is unassignable to NICE but Contractor notifies NICE                promptly in writing of any notice of the claim or of a threatened                or actual suit; and gives NICE on behalf of Contractor and NICE'                chosen counsel control of the defense thereof and all related                settlement negotiations; then in both such instances Contractor                shall not be responsible for Intellectual Property                indemnification with respect thereto. In all other events,                Contractor shall conduct the litigation as aforementioned.\n\n     12.7. Following establishment of infringement of Intellectual Property by a           competent authority including at interlocutory proceedings, whether           Contractor is responsible therefor or not, NICE may issue an ECR and           Contractor will handle such ECR and the corresponding ECO promptly in           accordance with Sections 3.10, 3.11.\n\n     12.8. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNIFICATION BY NICE. NICE shall indemnify,\n\n                                       35\n\n          hold harmless and defend Contractor from and against any and all           damages (including all damages awarded to a third party and payable by           Contractor), costs, losses, and expenses (including settlement awards           and reasonable attorney's fees) arising from or in connection with any           claim or suit made against Contractor or a third party which           Contractor is obligated to indemnify, by a third party based on an           allegation that the Products and/or the NICE Software infringe or           violate any Intellectual Property right, including due to the use of           any NICE Proprietary Information, NICE Intellectual Property, NICE           Software, Non Generic Equipment (if used in accordance with the           instructions provided by NICE), or due to performance as is of any           NICE written instructions including specifications and design, but\n\n\n\n\n\n          excluding any allegation that the Products infringe or violate any           Intellectual Property right due to the components and/or sub           assemblies supplied by Contractor hereunder and/or the manufacturing           processes and methods as performed by Contractor hereunder for which           Contractor is liable as per Section 12.6. above.\n\n          NICE' indemnification as provided under this Agreement shall apply           only if: NICE is notified promptly in writing of any notice of a claim           or of a threatened or actual suit; and is given control of the defense           thereof and all related settlement negotiations; and, Contractor           provides, at NICE' request and expense, all reasonable cooperation and           assistance for the defense and negotiations of the claim.\n\n     12.9. EMPLOYEE AND CONTRACTOR INDEMNIFICATION. Each of the parties agrees           that it will indemnify the other party against any and all claims           hereafter brought or asserted by any person against the other party           relating to any alleged or actual action or omission to act by the           indemnifying party arising from, or in connection with, such person's           status as an employee or independent Contractor of the indemnifying           person or the termination of such status.\n\n     12.10. PUBLICITY. Except with the express written consent of NICE,           Contractor shall not make any press announcement or publicize this           Agreement or any matters relating to any of the transactions           contemplated hereby or use NICE' name or trademark in any way           whatsoever, except to the extent required to comply with applicable           laws or governmental regulations, provided that Contractor acts           according to Section 12.5.\n\n13.  INSURANCE\n\n     13.1. Contractor shall be liable for the total or partial loss of or damage           to the components and/or the Products in so far as such loss or damage           has occurred while in Contractor's possession and until delivery of           the Products to NICE' freight forwarder at Contractor's facility.\n\n                                       36\n\n     13.2. Without limiting any of the obligations or liabilities of Contractor,           whether under this Agreement or by law, subject to any limitations           hereunder, Contractor shall maintain, and shall cause any           subcontractors engaged by Contractor to provide services under this           Agreement to maintain, at Contractor's own expense, as long as this           Agreement is in effect, insurance policies of the kind and limits as           set forth in APPENDIX D to this Agreement. The expense of such           insurance shall be borne by Contractor. The Contractor shall keep in           force the policies specified in sections 1 and 3 to the Insurance           Certificate valid as long as Contractor's legal liability EXISTS IN           CONNECTION WITH OPERATIONS ACCORDING TO THE AGREEMENT.\n\n          It is Contractor's responsibility to ensure that the insurance           requirements set forth in APPENDIX D to this Agreement remain in           effect for the term of this Agreement.\n\n     13.3. Within ten (10) Days of the execution of this Agreement, Contractor           shall furnish to NICE certificates of insurance evidencing full           compliance with the insurance requirements as set forth in APPENDIX D           to this Agreement. Certificates of Insurance shall be kept current           throughout the entire term of this Agreement.\n\n     13.4. The carrying of any insurance required hereunder shall not be           interpreted as relieving Contractor of any responsibility and/or           undertaking to NICE according to the provisions of this Agreement or           by law. Contractor shall give prompt notice of all losses or claims of           which Contractor has knowledge which may be in any way related to this           Agreement and Contractor shall assist and cooperate with any insurance           company in the adjustment or litigation of all claims arising under           this Agreement or by law and indemnifiable by Contractor under this           Agreement or by law.\n\n     13.5. NICE shall include in its property policies a waiver of subrogation           clause against the Contractor, its directors and any one on its           behalf, provided that such waiver will not be valid towards a person           which caused malicious damage.\n\n14.

Except as provided in Sections 15.2 and 15.3, any breach by any Party           of this Agreement which was not remedied within forty-five (45) Days           from the date of notice, shall be regarded as a fundamental breach.\n\n     15.2. Notwithstanding the aforementioned in Section 15.1, any delay in the           Due Date and/or Shipment Date, which was not remedied within thirty           (30) Days from the date of notice for the first delay, and any           subsequent delay upon notice (i.e. any second delay, even if the first           one was less then 30 days) shall be regarded as a fundamental breach.\n\n                                       37\n\n     15.3.

Contractor will use reasonable commercial efforts to return unused           inventory and to cancel pending orders for such inventory, and to           otherwise mitigate the amounts payable by NICE hereunder.\n\n     16.8. Upon termination of this Agreement by NICE due to breach by           Contractor, NICE shall be obligated to pay Contractor as follows: (i)           100% of the contract price for all finished Products in Contractor's           possession for which the Due Date has occurred and which have been           supplied to NICE' freight forwarder, which are subject to a Purchase           Order in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; (ii) 100% of the           cost in APPENDIX C of all inventory of Permitted Components in           Contractor's possession, which are not returnable to the vendor /           supplier according to APPENDIX C or usable for other customers (as           determined by Contractor in its sole discretion); provided however           that in the event Contractor fails to supply the Products and/or           Permitted Components to NICE, for any reason whatsoever, within 14           days after receipt of NICE' request, NICE shall be released from the           obligation to pay for the Products and /or Permitted Components as           provided for above. (iii) 100% of the cost in Appendix C of all           inventory and inventory on order of Permitted Components, which is not           cancelable according to Appendix C.

ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement, Schedules, Exhibits and Appendices           constitute the entire agreement between the parties in connection with           its subject matter and supersede all prior communications and           agreements between the parties relating to its subject matter.           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no documents, procedures,           methods or policies shall bind the Parties unless they are in writing           and signed by both parties, except that all the technical           documentation included in the PDM System may be changed as provided in           Section A (xxxii). Any change in NICE' procedures or policies, shall           bind Contractor after it is notified of same, unless the change is           material, in which case Contractor can object to the change on           reasonable grounds detailed in writing.\n\n     17.2. AMENDMENT. This Agreement may only be amended, varied or modified by           the prior agreement in writing of NICE and Contractor. Any such           amendment, variation or modification shall be binding upon the parties           and upon their successors and assigns. Work procedures and technical           documents may be signed by any representative on behalf of each of the           parties and need not be signed by authorized signatories of the           parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n     17.3. ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the           benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted           assigns. Neither party shall in any way sell, transfer, assign,           sub-contract or otherwise dispose of any of the rights, privileges,           duties and obligations granted or imposed upon it under this           Agreement. However, NICE may, at its discretion, transfer and/or           assign any of its rights, privileges, duties and obligations granted           or imposed upon it under this Agreement to any NICE Affiliate,           provided that NICE remains responsible towards Contractor, jointly and           severally with the Affiliate, for all of its obligations hereunder so           assigned, and provided further that the assignee signs this Agreement.\n\n                                       41\n\n          It is further clarified that NICE may choose, by written notice to           Contractor, to enable any NICE Affiliate to act on NICE' behalf and in           its name under this Agreement directly VIS-A-VIS Contractor, without           relieving NICE as the sole contractual party from responsibility for           performance of the Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Upon           NICE' prior written approval and upon the terms and limitations of           such approval, Contractor may sub-contract some of its obligations           (\"PERMITTED SUBCONTRACTORS\"), provided, however, that Contractor shall           remain obligated under this Agreement. Contractor shall provide to           NICE material qualifications and identification details of such           Permitted Subcontractors. Contractor shall at all times remain fully           responsible for the performance of all obligations of Contractor           hereunder, jointly and severally with the Permitted Subcontractors. In           selecting subcontractors to assist Contractor in the performance of           this Agreement, Contractor shall comply with all reasonable NICE           vendor screening requirements which are provided to it, and Contractor           shall also comply with its own vendor screening requirements.\n\n     17.4. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid,           illegal or unenforceable for any reason by any court of competent           jurisdiction, such provision shall be separable from the remainder of           the provisions hereof which shall continue in full force and effect as           if this Agreement had been executed with the invalid provisions           eliminated.\n\n     17.5. FORCE MAJEURE.\n\n          17.5.1. Neither party shall be liable to the other for any delay in                performance or failure to perform, in whole or in part, due to                war or act of war (whether an actual declaration is made or not),                riot, civil commotion, act of public enemy, fire, flood, or other                act of God, act of any governmental authority, or similar causes                beyond the reasonable control of such party which could not have                been foreseen or prevented. If any event of force majeure occurs,                the Party affected by such event shall promptly notify the other                Party of such event in writing and take all reasonable actions to                avoid the effect of such event.\n\n          17.5.2. Nevertheless, if any event of force majeure occurs for a                consecutive period of fourteen (14) Days preventing Contractor                from performing the Manufacturing Outsourcing Services, and                Contractor has not managed to set up the Manufacturing                Outsourcing Services at the Backup Site, NICE may, at its                discretion, elect to perform the Manufacturing Outsourcing                Services or any part thereof by itself and/or through others,                without derogating from its other rights and remedies, if                applicable. In such event: (a) Contractor shall assist NICE by                putting at its use, at NICE' request, Contractor Personnel who                are involved in the performance of this Agreement, to the extent                possible, at a charge to be agreed based on the labor rates in                APPENDIX C; (b) without derogating from any other obligations of                NICE hereunder as at such date to purchase Permitted Components,                NICE shall purchase from Contractor the additional Permitted                Components in Contractor's inventory, which are required, at                NICE' discretion, for manufacturing during the force majeure                period. The price and payment terms for purchase of such                Permitted Components shall be according to the provisions of                Section 3.4(A) above, which shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n\n                                       42\n\n          17.5.3. If the event of force majeure exists for more than 90 days,                each party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and                the provisions of Sections 16.2. and 16.3. regarding the notice                period required shall apply mutatis mutandis, and thereafter                Section 16 regarding effects of termination shall apply.\n\n     17.6. RELATIONSHIP. NICE and Contractor acknowledge and agree that this           Agreement shall not constitute, create or give effect to a joint           venture, pooling arrangement, principal/agency relationship,           partnership relationship or formal business organization of any kind           and neither Contractor and/or NICE shall have the right to bind the           other without the other's express prior written consent. Contractor           will render the Manufacturing Outsourcing Services as an independent           contractor and no employee - employer relationship shall exist between           Contractor and/or the Personnel and/or anyone on its behalf and NICE.\n\n     17.7. MANAGEMENT CHANGES. Contractor shall notify NICE immediately upon the           occurrence of any material change in the conduct of business of           Contractor or in the composition of its management, which has a\n\n\n\n\n\n          material adverse affect on Contractor's ability to perform this           Agreement.\n\n     17.8. WAIVER. The failure of either party to insist upon strict performance           of any provision of this Agreement, or the failure of either party to           exercise any right or remedy to which it is entitled hereunder, shall           not constitute a waiver thereof and shall not cause a diminution of           the obligations established by this Agreement. A waiver of any default           shall not constitute a waiver of any subsequent default. No waiver of           any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be effective unless it           is expressly stated to be a waiver and communicated to the other party           in writing in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.\n\n     17.9. DISPUTE RESOLUTION. Any dispute arising out of or relating to this           Agreement or the breach, termination or validity thereof shall be           settled in accordance with one of the following procedures. Contractor           and NICE shall use the procedures in the following order of priority.\n\n                                       43\n\n          17.9.1. In the event of any dispute, controversy or claim of any kind                or nature arising under or in connection with this Agreement                (including but not limited to disputes as to the creation,                validity, interpretation, breach or termination of this                Agreement) (a \"DISPUTE\"), then upon the written notice of either                Party, the Dispute will be submitted to the project manager on                behalf of each party to be escalated, in case the parties are                unable to resolve such Dispute, to the parties C.E.O.'s\n\n          17.9.2. Any dispute that the parties are unable to resolve pursuant to                Section 17.9.1. within 30 Days, will be submitted exclusively to                the competent courts in the Tel-Aviv-Jaffa District in Israel.\n\n          17.9.3. Without derogating from rights of termination as detailed in                this Agreement, it is clarified that Contractor will continue to                provide the Manufacturing Outsourcing Services and NICE shall                continue to perform its obligations hereunder during any                litigation, mediation or legal proceedings commenced pursuant to                this Section 17.9. above and the existence of a Dispute shall not                enable Contractor to stop work or services or otherwise not                timely perform its obligations or enable NICE to stop payments or                otherwise not timely perform its obligations.\n\n          17.9.4. The foregoing shall not affect the right of the parties to                seek injunctions before the competent Court.\n\n     17.10. Wherever in this Agreement it is provided that the Parties agree to           negotiate/review/change any term hereof (including prices), the           parties will usetheir best commercial efforts and negotiate in good           faith in order to reach such agreement. If the parties fail to agree,           no change will be made to the last agreed terms and they shall           continue to apply, except as otherwise specifically and explicitly           provided herein, and except that the provisions of Section 8.2. and           all its subsections will apply with regard to details included in           APPENDIX C.\n\n     17.11. LAW AND JURISDICTION. This Agreement shall be governed by and           construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Israel, without           giving effect to choice of law rules.\n\n                                       44\n\n     17.12.

The party requesting such relief shall simultaneously file a demand for arbitration of the dispute, and shall request that the AAA proceed under its rules for an expedited hearing.\n\n6.4. COSTS. Unless the arbitrator, if any, determines otherwise, each party will bear its own attorneys' fees and other costs associated with the negotiation and arbitration provided for by this Article 6  [DISPUTE RESOLUTION], except that costs and expenses regarding the arbitrators shall be shared equally. If court proceedings to stay litigation or compel arbitration are necessary, the party who unsuccessfully opposes such proceedings will pay all associated costs, expenses and attorneys' fees that are reasonably incurred by the other party. To the extent that any claim in arbitration relates to the collection of amounts owed under Article 4  [THE COMMERCIAL TERMS], the party entitled to collect such amounts shall be entitled to recover all reasonable costs of collection, including expenses and attorneys' fees that are incurred.\n\n6.5. TWO YEAR LIMITATION. Except for claims under Sections 9.4  [INDEMNIFICATION BY IMPRESSE] and 9.5  [INDEMNIFICATION BY VERTICALNET]\n\nSource: IMPRESSE CORP, S-1/A, 3/22/2000\n\n\n\n\n\nhereof, neither party may bring a claim or action regardless of form, arising out of or related to this Agreement, including any claim of fraud or misrepresentation, more than two years after the cause of action accrues or becomes known, whichever is later.\n\n6.6.

In addition, the non-breaching party shall take reasonable steps to mitigate damages arising out of such breach.\n\n7.   CONFIDENTIALITY\n\n7.1. CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS.

INJUNCTION. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Article 7  [CONFIDENTIALITY] are reasonable and necessary to protect the other party's interests in its Confidential Information, that any breach of the provisions of this Article 7  [CONFIDENTIALITY] may result in irreparable harm to such other party, and that the remedy at law for such breach may be inadequate. Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Article 7  [CONFIDENTIALITY] by a party hereto, the other party, in addition to any other relief available to it at law, in equity or otherwise, shall be entitled to seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief restraining the breaching party from engaging in and/or continuing any conduct that would constitute a breach of this Article 7  [CONFIDENTIALITY], without posting a bond or other security.\n\n7.5.

The parties will come to agreement with respect to Exhibit A as to whether prior written approval is needed in every instance or whether it is not needed after the first instance has been approved in writing (e.g., given exigencies in television production business, it is reasonable that Zynga would approve the use of its brand conceptually in elements of an episode but not need to re-approve the use in a similar manner for every episode the brand is used in; and similarly, given exigencies in the social gaming business, it is reasonable that WPT would approve use of its brand conceptually in elements of the Zynga platform but not need to re-approve the use in a similar manner for every poker tournament the brand is used in). i. Licensee may use textual and/or pictorial matter pertaining to the Licensed Property on such promotional, display and advertising material as may, in Licensee's reasonable judgment, promote the awareness, consumption and sale of the Licensed Property.

All press releases respecting this Agreement or the relationship of the parties herein shall require prior written approval by the other party. ii. Licensor will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide approval and/or feedback within five (5) business days after its receipt of a creative submission, or re-submission, with respect to the Licensed Property or marketing materials; provided that: (a) if Licensor declines to approve any submission or re-submission, then it shall provide reasonably detailed feedback in order to enable Licensee to modify the Licensed Property or marketing material accordingly in order to address Licensor's concerns and obtain Licensor's approval, and (b) if Licensor fails to (1) approve or (2) disapprove and provide feedback within such timeframe, then such submission or re-submission is deemed to have been approved. No approval may be unreasonably withdrawn by Licensor once delivered. iii. Zynga shall advise WPT to Zynga's knowledge as to which jurisdictions where it may be illegal to advertise Zynga's Licensed Property (if any) given local laws or regulations. iv. WPT or its affiliates shall not authorize a Zynga Competitor to commercially exploit the Licensed Property in connection with social poker gaming via a license similar to the license granted herein for the Term.

PAYMENT a. Annual Minimum Guarantee. Zynga will pay to WPT the Annual Minimum Guarantee as set forth in the Basic Provisions. The Annual Minimum Guarantee shall be recoupable from such Royalties as are, or have become, paid to WPT.

The Royalties to be paid by Zynga to WPT is the percentage of Net Revenue as set forth in Section 5 of the Basic Provisions. \"Net Revenue(s)\" shall be defined as one hundred percent (100%) of gross revenues and all other receivables of any kind whatsoever received by Zynga or any of Zynga's affiliates attributable to the use of Paid Currency or in connection with the sale of Virtual Digital Goods derived from use of the WPT-brand on the Zynga platform, less the following actual and verifiable \"Allowable Deductions\": (i) out-of-pocket, third-party payment processing and currency system fees, commissions, and platform distribution fees (e.g., Apple, Google or Facebook platform fees); (ii) any governmental taxes (e.g., VAT, excise or sales or use tax, etc.) arising in connection with related receipts, but excluding any taxes on Licensee's net income; and (iii) charge- backs/refunds/cancellations/fraud. \"Paid Currency\" means virtual currency purchased using real money. \"Virtual Digital Goods\" means any virtual, digital representation of any actual or fictional thing or item within Zynga Poker, which is capable of being made available for distribution, placement, download or other display by electronic means. Any other deductions must be mutually agreed upon in advance and in writing by the parties.\n\n5\n\nSource: ALLIED ESPORTS ENTERTAINMENT, INC., 8-K, 8/15/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nc. Payment.

Zynga shall pay all amounts accruing under this Agreement for any reporting period to WPT by check or wire transfer to the account specified by WPT in writing, concurrently with Zynga's delivery of the applicable report under Section 3(d), provided that payments will only be paid if the amount owed to WPT for any reporting period is greater than five hundred dollars ($500.00). An amount due of less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) will be accumulated to the next payment and will be included in the amount to be paid to WPT on the next payment date, again provided that the amount owed to WPT in the subsequent month exceeds five hundred dollars ($500.00).

Subcontractor and Manufacturer may also be referred to herein individually as \"Party\" or collectively as the \"Parties\". RECITALS WHEREAS, Subcontractor currently is the registered manufacturer of hearing aids and related components and accessories (the \"Zounds Products\") that are sold under the Subcontractor's brand names through various marketing and distribution channels. WHEREAS the Parties desire to enter an agreement whereby the Subcontractor as the Manufacturer's subcontractor will provide design, technology, manufacturing and supply chain services to the Manufacturer to enable the Manufacturer to manufacture comparable hearing aids and related components and accessories to be sold under Manufacturer's exclusive brand names (the \"Manufacturer's Products\") through the Manufacturer's various marketing and distribution channels. WHEREAS, the Parties also desire to enter into a lease agreement of Subcontractor's current Chandler, Arizona facility that provides the Manufacturer an FDA medical device facility for the Manufacturer's Products. WHEREAS, the Parties also desire to enter into an agreement that provides for the joint marketing and sale of each other's products. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and covenants contained herein, the Parties hereby agree as follows: 1. Term. Subject to earlier termination as provided in this Agreement, the initial term of this Agreement shall be for a period beginning on the Effective Date and ending ten (10) years thereafter unless this Agreement is terminated earlier as provided herein. This Agreement will renew automatically thereafter for successive one-year terms unless and until one Party gives notification of termination with at least sixty (60) days written notice. All orders placed under this Agreement must be placed prior to the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n2. Technology Access Fee. Manufacturer will pay Subcontractor One Million and No/100 USD ($1,000,000) (the \"Technology Access Fee\"). The Technology Access Fee will be paid in two equal installments of $500,000 each. The first installment will be due thirty (30) days following the Effective Date and the second installment will be due sixty (60) days following the Effective Date.\n\n3. Orders for Manufacturer's Products to be Manufactured by Subcontractor\n\n3.1 Purchase Orders: Excess Inventory. Manufacturer shall provide to Subcontractor a purchase order setting forth the proposed quantity of Manufacturer's Products to be purchased by Manufacturer and delivery dates, which purchase order will be subject to written acceptance by Subcontractor. All purchase orders are non-cancellable, and the Manufacturer shall pay for the purchaser orders as follows: (i) for purchase orders for less than or equal to a total of five hundred (500) units in any given calendar month, payment of fifty percent (50%) of Product Cost (as defined below) shall be made in full at the time the order is placed and the remaining balance paid in full before the Manufacturer's Products are shipped; and (ii) for purchase orders for more than five hundred (500) units in any given calendar month, payment of one hundred percent (100%) of Product Cost shall be made in full at the time the order is placed. Manufacturer's purchase orders accepted by Subcontractor and any forecast provided to Subcontractor by Manufacturer will constitute authorization for Subcontractor to procure product components to manufacture the Manufacturer's Products covered by such purchase orders based on their lead times. Subcontractor will advise Manufacturer of the lead time of components contained within their order and any forecast and Manufacturer will pay for the components prior to the Subcontractor placing orders for the components.\n\n3.2 Contract Formation: Acceptance and Entire Agreement. Each time Manufacturer submits an order for Manufacturer's Products and Subcontractor accepts the order or ships the ordered Manufacturer's Products to Manufacturer, a new contract is formed consisting of this Agreement, the quantities and delivery dates specified in the order and the prices then offered by Subcontractor. ACCEPTANCE OF MANUFACTURER'S ORDER IS EXPRESSLY LIMITED TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY ORAL OR WRITTEN STATEMENT MADE BY MANUFACTURER, AND DOES NOT IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE OF MANUFACTURER'S TERMS AND CONDITIONS EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. NO TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN ANY PURCHASE ORDER FORM, WHETHER PROVIDED BY MANUFACTURER OR SUBCONTRACTOR, WILL BECOME A PART OF THE CONTRACT AND THIS CONTRACT WILL GOVERN ALL PURCHASES. Manufacturer's acceptance of or payment for Manufacturer's Products that Manufacturer has not ordered creates a contract comprised of this Agreement, the quantities of Manufacturer's Products accepted or paid for, and the prices then offered by Subcontractor. This Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement with respect to any contract formed and shall not be altered, amended, supplemented or canceled without the express written agreement of both Manufacturer and Subcontractor.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Product Prices. Pricing shall be the actual cost of the manufacturing of each Manufacturer's Product plus the proportional allocation of the costs of Subcontractor's manufacturing, engineering, and supply chain overhead, as mutually agreed by the Parties (the \"Product Cost\"). Title of the product will transfer to the Manufacturer at the shipping dock of the manufacturing facility. Manufacturer will be responsible for shipping costs. Manufacturer shall pay any taxes incurred in the manufacture of Manufacturer's Products, including any taxes incurred as a result of purchasing components or maintaining inventory. In addition to the Royalties paid under this Agreement to the Subcontractor, Manufacturer shall pay any other third-party royalties for technology that are required to manufacture the Manufacturer's Products for their intended purpose. As of the date of this Agreement neither Party is aware of any third-party royalties for technology that Manufacturer would be liable to pay. Subcontractor will provide Manufacturer with documentation substantiating any Product Cost variance upon request.\n\n3.4 Cost Reductions. Potential Product Cost reductions as a result of materials pricing will be reviewed and implemented periodically as mutually agreed and passed on to the Manufacturer. Product Cost reductions resulting from engineering changes or other changes, initiated by Manufacturer, that would impact either Product Costs or process changes at Subcontractor will be implemented at an agreed upon time. Manufacturer will be responsible for their proportionate share of any Product Cost reduction that is a result of engineering investment by the Subcontractor. If the Manufacturer does not pay its proportionate share, the Manufacturer will pay the Product Cost as if the cost reduction had not been made (i.e., the Product Cost prior to the cost reduction as if the cost reduction were not made). The Subcontractor will list the new Product Cost and a line item for engineering investment that accounts for the difference.\n\n3.5 Royalties. In addition to paying the Product Costs of Manufacturer's Products, Manufacturer shall also pay to Subcontractor the following royalty payments (each a \"Royalty\" and collectively the \"Royalties\") for each of Manufacturer's Product purchased under this Agreement. Royalties shall be paid 50% at time of shipping and the remaining balance of 50% due in 15-days after the Manufacturer's Products have shipped from the manufacturing facility. a) Non-Rechargeable Products. For Manufacturer's Products that are non-rechargeable, Manufacturer shall pay Subcontractor a Royalty equal to the higher of (i) eighty percent (80.0%) of the Product Cost; and (ii) $80 per unit. b) Rechargeable Products. For Manufacturer's Products that are rechargeable, Manufacturer shall pay Subcontractor a Royalty equal to the higher of (i) one hundred percent (100.0%) of the Product Cost; and (ii) $100 per unit. 3.6 Zounds' Products and Manufacturers Products Built to Manufacturer's Specifications. Subject to Section 7 below, Subcontractor agrees to manufacture Manufacturer's Products (i) that are identical to Zounds' Products allowing Manufacturer to utilize Subcontractor's existing product designs and features and/ or (ii) to specifications provided by Manufacturer from time to time with approval of such changes by Subcontractor. Any advice given by Subcontractor to Manufacturer before or after delivery of Products built to Manufacturer's specifications is based solely upon the information available to Subcontractor, and the use of such advice by Manufacturer is solely and entirely at Manufacturer's own risk. Manufacturer represents and warrants that it has independently determined the fitness, need, usefulness, and applicability of the Manufacturer's Products built to Manufacturer's specifications it has ordered and does not rely on any representation of Subcontractor in that regard.\n\n3.7 Engineering Services and Design Changes. Manufacturer may elect to utilize Subcontractor's design engineering resources (the \"Engineering and Design Services\") to further customize Manufacturer's Products. The cost of Engineering and Design Services to be paid by Manufacturer will be agreed to in a written document setting forth the scope, timing and other terms of such Engineering and Design Services executed by the Parties prior to any services being provided by Subcontractor. Subject to the written agreement of the parties with respect to any resulting change in price, delivery schedule and other terms, Subcontractor will accept design changes (i.e., Engineering Change Orders or \"ECO's\") according to Manufacturer's instructions.\n\n3.8 Tooling, Setup and Non-Recurring Engineering (\"NRE\") Charges. Subcontractor agrees to provide Manufacturer with a quote for any one-time tooling, setup or NRE charges payable by Manufacturer as a result of a change in design requested by Manufacturer, change in minimum quantity requirements by Manufacturer as originally quoted by Subcontractor, or an addition to the Manufacturer's Products purchased under this Agreement requested by Manufacturer. If Manufacturer elects to proceed with the design change, minimum quantity requirements change or addition as specified in Subcontractor's quote, Manufacturer will provide Subcontractor with written acceptance of Subcontractor's quoted terms.\n\n3.9 Inventory Reports. Subcontractor agrees to report its inventory position to Manufacturer on a monthly basis, including the following information: quantity of raw material, work in process and any open orders that cannot be cancelled to the supplier lead time. The report will specifically identify any material on hand or on order where the quantity exceeds the agreed three (3) month forward looking forecast plus safety stock as agreed upon by Subcontractor and Manufacturer. The Subcontractor and Manufacturer will review inventory levels and safety stocks quarterly.\n\n4. Delivery and Shipping. The agreed upon delivery dates are based on the Subcontractor's projected lead time, current inventory, commitments and Subcontractor's advice. Manufacturer agrees and acknowledges that all shipment dates are firm delivery dates. All shipments shall be F.O.B. the manufacturing facility unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing. The method and route of shipment shall be at Subcontractor's discretion, unless Manufacturer supplies instructions in writing at least five days prior to shipment. In addition to the purchase price, Manufacturer shall pay any and all transportation charges (including insurance). The risk of loss of and title to the Manufacturer's Products pass to Manufacturer upon the receipt of the Manufacturer's Products by the carrier. Subcontractor is not responsible for any installation of Manufacturer's Products sold\n\n\n\n\n\nhereunder or delays caused by Manufacturer-specified suppliers.\n\n5. Leased Space Agreement.

If Subcontractor determines that the Manufacturer's Products are nonconforming under the Standards, Subcontractor, shall work with their vendors to rework the Manufacturer's Products or otherwise replace the Manufacturer's Products. Manufacturer shall be liable for the cost of rework or replacement and all associated costs therewith including, without limitation, transportation charges and inspection fees.

Servicing Duties of the Servicer.\n\n(a) The Owner authorizes Curo Management, LLC, to act, and Curo Management, LLC, agrees to act, as an independent contractor, as the Servicer effective upon the date hereof.\n\n(b) From and after the date on which a Receivable or Participation Interest, as applicable, is sold to the Owner, the Servicer shall service and administer each related Serviced Asset for the benefit of the Owner and shall extend, amend or otherwise modify such Serviced Asset, by complying in all material respects with the following (collectively, the \"Servicing Standard\"): (A) reasonable care, using that degree of skill and attention that the Servicer exercises with respect to comparable receivables that it services for itself or others, and (B) Applicable Law.\n\n(c) The Servicer shall have full power and authority, acting alone or through any party properly designated by it hereunder,\n\n\n\n\n\nincluding any Sub-Servicer, to do any and all things in connection with such servicing and administration which it may deem necessary or desirable, consistent with the terms of this Servicing Agreement and the Servicing Standard. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless such power is revoked by the Owner on account of the occurrence of a Servicer Default, the Servicer shall have full power and authority (i) to make withdrawals from the applicable servicer collection account permitted by the terms of this Servicing Agreement, the Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document and (ii) to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Owner, any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release or discharge, and all other comparable instruments, with respect to the Receivables and, after the delinquency of any Receivable and to the extent permitted under and in compliance with applicable Servicing Standard and the Loan Agreement, to commence collection proceedings with respect to such Receivables. The Owner shall furnish the Servicer with any documents reasonably requested by the Servicer, including powers of attorney, as necessary or appropriate to enable the Servicer (or any Sub-Servicer on its behalf) to carry out its servicing and administrative duties hereunder.\n\n(d) The Servicer shall collect and process all collections on the Serviced Assets in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in Section 2.3 of the Loan Agreement and the Servicing Multi-Party Agreement.\n\nSection 2.

The indemnities contained in this Section 2(c) shall survive the resignation and removal of the Servicer or the termination of this Agreement.\n\n(d) Subject to Sections 4 and 5, the Servicer shall administer, perform or supervise the performance of such other activities in connection with the Serviced Assets (including the Loan Documents) as are not covered by any of the foregoing provisions and are reasonably within the capability of the Servicer. In no case may Servicer use any identifiable information, including consumers' nonpublic personal information and related account performance and status information, for any purpose other than as provided in this Agreement; provided, however, that Servicer is permitted to use nonidentifiable, aggregated consumer information obtained in connection with its activities undertaken pursuant to this Agreement.\n\n(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Servicer shall not be obligated to, and shall not, take any action that the Owner directs the Servicer not to take or which could reasonably be expected to result in a violation or breach of the Owner's covenants, agreements or obligations under any of the Loan Documents.\n\n(f) The Servicer shall maintain appropriate books of account and records relating to services performed hereunder, which books of account and records shall be accessible for inspection by the Owner at any time during normal business hours.\n\nSection 3. Reports and Information.\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) At the times and in the manner required by Section 6.1 of the Loan Agreement, the Servicer shall deliver to the Owner and the Agent the reports described therein.\n\n(b) The Servicer shall furnish in writing to the Owner and the Agent from time to time such additional information regarding the Serviced Assets as the Owner or the Agent shall reasonably request.\n\nSection 4. Independence of the Servicer. For all purposes of this Agreement, the Servicer shall be an independent contractor and shall not be subject to the supervision of the Owner with respect to the manner in which it accomplishes the performance of its obligations hereunder; provided, however, Servicer shall be subject to the Owner's third-party vendor management program. Unless expressly authorized by the Owner in this Agreement or otherwise, the Servicer shall have no authority to act for or represent the Owner in any way and shall not otherwise be deemed an agent of the Owner.\n\nSection 5. No Joint Venture. Nothing contained in this Agreement (i) shall constitute the Servicer and the Owner as members of any partnership, joint venture, association, syndicate, unincorporated business or other separate entity, (ii) shall be construed to impose any liability as such on any of them or (iii) shall be deemed to confer on any of them any express, implied or apparent authority to incur any obligation or liability on behalf of the others.\n\nSection 6. Other Activities of Servicer. Nothing herein shall prevent the Servicer or its respective Affiliates from engaging in other businesses or, in its sole discretion, from acting in a similar capacity for any other person or entity even though such person or entity may engage in business activities similar to those of the Owner.\n\nSection 7. Term of Agreement; Resignation and Removal of Servicer.\n\n(a) This Agreement shall continue in force until the earlier to occur of (i) the Owner no longer owns any Receivables or Participation Interests, and (ii) subject to Section 7(d), the delivery of written notice of termination by the Owner to the Servicer pursuant to Section 7(c), in each case upon which event this Agreement shall automatically terminate unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Servicer and the Owner.\n\n(b) Subject to Section 7(d), the Servicer may resign its duties hereunder by providing the Owner with at least 60 days' prior written notice.\n\n(c) Subject to Section 7(d), and subject to the prior written consent of the Agent so long as the Loan Agreement remains outstanding, the Owner may remove the Servicer immediately upon written notice of termination from the Owner to the Servicer if any of the following events shall occur (each, a \"Servicer Termination Right - Owner\"):\n\n(i) the Servicer shall default in the performance of any of its duties under this Agreement and, after notice of such default, shall not cure such default within 30 days (or, if such default cannot be cured in such time, shall not give within 30 days such assurance of cure as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Owner); or\n\n(ii) the Servicer files or consents to the filing of any petition, either voluntary or involuntary, to take advantage of any applicable insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization statute, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or\n\n(iii) the Servicer fails to maintain, in any material respect, all necessary licenses and approvals in each jurisdiction in which it is performing the primary servicing function for any of the Serviced Assets under this Agreement.\n\nThe Servicer agrees that if any of the events specified in clause (ii) of this Section 7(c) shall occur, it shall give written notice thereof to the Owner within seven (7) days after the occurrence of such event.\n\n(d) No termination, resignation or removal of the Servicer pursuant to this Section shall be effective until (i) a successor Servicer shall have been appointed by or on behalf of the Owner with the prior written consent of the Agent so long as the Loan Agreement remains outstanding, and (ii) such successor Servicer shall have agreed in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement in the same manner as the Servicer is bound hereunder.\n\n(e) Agent may terminate this Agreement upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default under the Loan Agreement by delivery of written notice of termination from Agent to Owner and Servicer (a \"Servicer Termination Right - Agent\" and, together with the Servicer Termination Right - Owner, each a \"Servicer Termination Right\"):\n\nIf a successor Servicer does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Servicer resigns or is removed, the resigning or removed Servicer or the Owner may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Servicer.\n\nIn the event that the Servicer resigns or is terminated hereunder, the Servicer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to and shall cooperate with the Owner and take other reasonable steps requested by the Owner to assist in the orderly and efficient transfer of the administration of the Serviced Assets to the successor Servicer.\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 8. Action upon Termination, Resignation or Removal of the Servicer. Promptly upon the effective date of termination of this Agreement or the resignation or removal of the Servicer pursuant to Section 7, the Servicer shall be entitled to be paid all fees and reimbursable expenses, including any reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys' fees, accruing to it to the date of such termination, resignation or removal. The Servicer shall forthwith upon such termination pursuant to Section 7 deliver to the successor Servicer all property and documents of or relating to the Serviced Assets then in the custody of the Servicer, or if this Agreement has been terminated, to the Owner. In the event of the resignation or removal of the Servicer pursuant to Section 7, the Servicer shall cooperate with the Owner and take all reasonable steps requested to assist the Owner in making an orderly transfer of the duties of the Servicer.\n\nSection 9. Compensation. The Servicer will be entitled to receive the Servicing Fee for the performance of the duties and provision of the services called for in this Agreement in accordance with, and subject to, the Loan Agreement. The Servicing Fee shall be payable on each Payment Date for the immediately prior Servicing Period in accordance with Section 2.4 of the Loan Agreement. Any opinion, filing or other services performed by the Servicer hereunder that generates additional costs shall be at the expense of the Owner.\n\nSection 10. Sub-Servicers; Collection Agents.\n\n(a) The Servicer may appoint one or more Persons (including any Affiliate) as a sub-servicer (each a \"Sub-Servicer\") with respect to some or all of the Serviced Assets to perform any of the Servicer's obligations hereunder from time to time in its sole discretion; provided, however, that such servicing arrangement and the term of the related subservicing agreement (if any) must provide for the servicing of the Serviced Assets in a manner equivalent or greater than the Servicing Standard; provided, further, that the Servicer shall remain obligated and be liable to the Owner for the servicing and administering of the Serviced Assets in accordance with the provisions hereof without diminution of such obligation and liability by virtue of the appointment of such Sub-Servicer and to the same extent and under the same terms and conditions as if the Servicer alone were servicing and administering the Serviced Assets.\n\n(b) The Servicer shall be entitled to terminate the subservicing of the Serviced Assets by any Sub-Servicer so appointed at any time in its sole discretion, provided, that any subservicing agreement entered into by Servicer with any such Sub-Servicer shall terminate by its terms no later than thirty (30) days after the Servicer is terminated as the servicer under this Agreement.\n\n(c) Each Sub-Servicer shall be entitled to compensation for its services as a Sub-Servicer as agreed to by the Servicer and such Sub-Servicer provided that any sub-servicing fees payable to the Sub-Servicer in respect of its servicing activities shall be payable out of the Servicing Fee.\n\n(d) Any subservicing arrangement that may be entered into and any other transactions or services relating to the Serviced Assets involving a Sub-Servicer in its capacity as such shall be deemed to be solely between the Sub-Servicer and the Servicer alone, and the Owner shall not be deemed party thereto and shall have no claims, rights, obligations, duties, or liabilities with respect to the Sub-Servicer in such capacity.\n\n(e) The Owner may, from time to time, enter into Collection Agency Agreements with Collection Agents for the collection of delinquent or defaulted accounts. Any such Collection Agent shall not be deemed a \"Sub-Servicer\" hereunder and the Servicer shall have no liability with respect to the acts or omissions of any such Collection Agent. Any Collection Fees shall be paid directly by the Owner in accordance with the Loan Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer shall cooperate with the Owner and provide such assistance as is reasonably necessary to transfer servicing of applicable Serviced Assets to the related Collection Agent.\n\nSection 11. Representations and Warranties of the Servicer.

Object of the Affiliate Program/ Affiliate Management Program for Software Publishers\n\nThe object of the Affiliate Program provided by element 5 (hereafter, \"Program\") is to publish electronic advertisements on the Web site of the Affiliate for selected software products offered by element 5 Software Publishers. Instead of fixed compensation, the Affiliate receives result- dependent Advertising Cost Compensation (also known in the element 5 Control Panel as \"Commission\") in exchange for publishing the advertisements. The Advertising Cost Compensation depends on the actual sales generated by end users referred via the electronic advertisement (the Affiliate's link).\n\nWithin the context of sales processed from this Program, element 5 acts (to the end user) as a service provider for Software Publisher and handles the sales process by proxy of Software Publisher in accordance with underlying share-it! Developer Agreement. element 5 receives an additional service fee from the participating Publishers for this Affiliate Management.\n\nUnder the terms of this Affiliate Management, \"Software Publisher's Control Panel\" shall mean the password protected secure interface on element 5's Web servers that allows the Software Publisher to gain access to Sales data and End User data through a secure online connection and change Software Publisher related settings, e.g. the commission of the Affiliate and activation and deactivation of the Affiliate.\n\n\"Affiliate's Control Panel\" shall mean the password protected secure interface on element 5's Web servers that allows the Affiliate to (i) gain access to referred sales through a secure online connection and (ii) change Affiliate related settings, e.g. input or alteration of personal data, definition of default style within the context of the given technical limitations, and requests for new partnerships with Software Publishers or termination of existing partnerships.\n\nSource: SOUTHERN STAR ENERGY INC., SB-2/A, 12/2/2005\n\n\n\n\n\nII. Affiliate Program\n\n\u00a7 1 Affiliate Participation\n\nParticipation of an individual Affiliate in the Program is dependent on activation by the Software Publisher. Once the Affiliate has registered, element 5 will send an e-mail to Software Publisher with a request to activate the Affiliate. Once the Affiliate is activated by the Software Publisher, the Affiliate is considered to be a participant in this program and is bound by these General Terms and Conditions.\n\n\u00a7 2 Products under the Agreement\n\n(1) The Products under the Agreement are software products designated by the respective Software Publisher for this purpose and which can be selected by the Affiliate from a product catalog in the Affiliate Control Panel. (2) Following initial activation of a product under the agreement, the Affiliate has the opportunity to choose further software products (including those from other Software Publishers), found in the Affiliate's Control Panel, and offer them on the Affiliate's Web site under these General Terms and Conditions. However, the offering of these new products is dependent on the Software Publisher activating the Affiliate for the respective software.\n\n\u00a7 3 Control Panel\n\n(1) After successfully completing the registration process for participation in the Program, the Affiliate will be sent a user ID and a password to access to the \"Affiliate Control Panel\". With the user ID and password, the \"Affiliate Control Panel\" provides the Affiliate access, via a secure online connection, to a secure area on element 5's Web server so that the Affiliate may, at any time, view the number of software sales the Affiliate has referred, as well as change other settings. (2) When using the user ID and password, the Affiliate shall observe the following obligations and precautions: (i) Only the Affiliate may use the user ID and password. (ii) The password shall be kept strictly confidential. The Affiliate shall take due care to ensure that no unauthorized parties learn the password. (iii) If the Affiliate loses its password or if there is a possibility that an unauthorized party has learned the user ID and password, the Affiliate shall immediately report this to element 5, which can then block access by the Affiliate to the Control Panel. All actions carried out with the user ID and password will be attributed to the Affiliate.\n\n\u00a7 4 Integration of the Link\n\n(1) The Affiliate shall integrate the product under the agreement using the appropriate link on its Web site; the link points to the order form operated by element 5. This link is generated by a Link Generator for the respective product under the agreement. The Link\n\nSource: SOUTHERN STAR ENERGY INC., SB-2/A, 12/2/2005\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerator is located in the secure area of element 5's Web site in the \"Affiliate Control Panel\". The link that is generated contains an individualized affiliate user ID by means of which any sales can be attributed to the Affiliate. Proper technical integration of the link is the responsibility of the Affiliate. If the links do not function, no Advertising Cost Compensation will be paid. (2) The Affiliate shall indicate on its Web site that (i) the Affiliate is acting as an independent partner of the respective Software Publisher by participation in the Affiliate Program provided by element 5 and (ii) The Software Publisher is the seller of the product and the payment process is administered by element 5. (3) The Affiliate shall produce a brief description for each activated product on its Web site. The Affiliate is responsible for the content, the style and the layout of this information. The Software Publisher can provide the Affiliate with graphics and text in an electronic format for use in describing the product, which the Affiliate shall use for the purpose of advertising the Products under the Agreement and links according to the instructions of the Software Publisher. The Affiliate should be aware that the product prices and availability may change at any time. It is not recommended that the price be listed on the Web site of the Affiliate. Maintenance of these product prices is possible only on the Web sites of the Software Publisher and the Publisher's corresponding site operated by element 5.\n\n\u00a7 5 Order Processing\n\n(1) element 5 shall be responsible for the entire order processing for the referred end user according to the terms and conditions of the underlying share-it! Developer Agreement between the Software Publisher and element 5. element 5 shall provide the order forms for the order processing on its Web server; receive payments from the referred end users and forward these payments, less the agreed Advertising Cost Compensation, the service fees and relevant value added tax (VAT) to the Software Publisher; handle refunds and returns according to the provisions of the underlying share-it! Developer Agreement; and provide end user service relating to the administration of the order. The Software Publisher shall provide technical end-user service. (2) element 5 reserves the right to reject queries and orders which do not meet its requirements; including, in particular, orders by referred end users who do not meet credit requirements, who do not authorize direct debiting from their bank account, or who do not present a valid credit card. (3) An agreement by the Software Publisher with the referred end user does not exist until either a written or electronic order confirmation arrives from element 5 in the name of the Software Publisher or when element 5 begins to fulfill the agreement in the name of the Software Publisher. Typographical, printing and computation errors on the Web site of the Affiliate shall be charged to said Affiliate.\n\n\u00a7 6 Advertising Cost Compensation\n\n(1) element 5 will pay Affiliate its advertising costs (including Vat, if any, on presentation of a valid VAT invoice) if an end user arrives via the link integrated in Affiliate's Web site at the order page hosted by element 5 for the respective Software\n\nSource: SOUTHERN STAR ENERGY INC., SB-2/A, 12/2/2005\n\n\n\n\n\nPublisher's Product under this Agreement and end user uses the automatic ordering system that carries out the registration and payment processing, so that the Affiliate's link is deemed to be directly causative for the entry of the End User into the agreement with the Software Publisher and End User's payment, proving that all requirements are irrevocably met (\"agreements arising in a qualified manner\"). Affiliate is only eligible to earn the Advertising Cost Compensation on sales occurring during the term of this Agreement and fees earned up to the date termination will remain payable only if the related orders are not cancelled or returned. (2) Insofar as the referred end user accepts cookies when clicking on Affiliate's link, proceeds from orders will be taken into account which do arise within the lifespan (of max. 180 days) of the cookie(s) used and/ or possibly within the lifespan of a special action of the Software Publisher via integrated link. (3) element 5 shall record and compute on a monthly basis the amount of said Advertising Cost Compensation for the Affiliate. (4) The computation basis for determining the value of the Advertising Cost Compensation is calculated by the gross sales price (including taxes, shipping and handling, etc.) actually invoiced to the referred end user. The percentage of the respective Advertising Cost Compensation shall be stipulated by the Software Publisher, but shall not exceed 50% of the effective gross sales price of the software. (5) The Advertising Cost Compensation shall not be paid if and insofar as it is determined that the end user will not meet its payment obligations or will meet them only partially, or if for any other reason the invoice to the end user was cancelled (e.g. in cases where a charge back of a credit card charge, a debit advice or other return or refund of the software product occurs). If the Advertising Cost Compensation was previously paid by element 5, it can be offset or invoiced to Affiliate at element 5's own discretion. (6) The payment of the Advertising Cost Compensation shall occur monthly insofar as the sum due exceeds a value of 100 EUR / 100 USD. If this is not the case, the sum due can be retained until a total value of at least 100 EUR / 100 USD is reached, at the latest, upon termination of the Affiliate's participation in the Program. (7) The payment can be made by wire transfer, Direct Deposit (US only) or check, as chosen by the Affiliate. (8) The invoicing is deemed to be approved if the Affiliate does not object in writing, including a statement of reasons, within four weeks.\n\nIII. Affiliate Management for Software Publishers\n\n\u00a7 1 Participation by the Software Publisher\n\n(1) Software Publisher's participation in Affiliate Management indicates that the Software Publisher agrees to these General Terms and Conditions, and that the Software Publisher shall integrate the Affiliate Program into the Web site using a corresponding link. (2) To generate revenue through this Program by means of sales referred by the Affiliate, the Affiliate, after completion of registration, must be activated by the Software Publisher in the Control Panel. The Software Publisher will be informed of the Affiliate's\n\nSource: SOUTHERN STAR ENERGY INC., SB-2/A, 12/2/2005\n\n\n\n\n\nregistration per e-mail with a request for the Affiliate's activation from element 5. (3) By configuring the settings in the Control Panel, the Software Publisher determines the amount of the success-based Advertising Cost Compensation. If the Publisher does not configure any settings, then it will accept the default settings proposed by element 5 when activating the Affiliate. Prior to making changes in the Control Panel regarding the amount of the Advertising Cost Compensation, written notification must be given to element 5 and the Affiliate.\n\n\u00a7 2 Integration of the link\n\n(1) element 5 shall make a hyperlink available to the Software Publisher that links to the appropriate registration form for the Affiliate Program. The link can be accessed in the secure \"Software Publisher Control Panel\" on element 5's Web site under \"Affiliate Management\". (2) Every Affiliate must complete the registration form once prior to participating in the Program and agree to these General Terms and Conditions by checking the Online checkbox. Afterwards, the Affiliate can also advertise other Products under this Agreement (see above \u00a7 3) after activation by the respective Software Publisher.\n\n\u00a7 3 element 5's Service Fee\n\nFor each sale administered by element 5 of the Software under this Agreement, element 5 shall receive an additional service fee of 2% of the gross sales price (including taxes, shipping and handling, etc.) as well as the Advertising Cost Compensation defined in II. \u00a7 6 (4) and in addition to VAT or sales tax (where applicable). element 5 will pay the Affiliate the Advertising Cost Compensation as defined in II. \u00a7 6 . Further invoicing terms are obtained from the existing business relationship, defined in the respective share-it! Developer Agreement between Software Publisher and element 5.\n\nIV. General terms\n\n\u00a7 1 License\n\nUpon activation of the Affiliate, the Software Publisher grants the Affiliate a non-exclusive, revocable right to use provided advertising material, notices and all further presentations (insofar as available - also known hereafter as \"Material\") only for the purpose of designating its Web site as a \"partner Web site\" and presenting the designated advertising Material. Under no circumstances may the transferred Material be edited or modified without prior written permission of the Software Publisher. element 5 and the Software Publisher retain all rights with regard to their logos, their trade name or their trademarks and other commercial protection rights. The Software Publisher and element 5 are authorized to revoke the license granted to the Affiliate at any time by written notice.\n\nSource: SOUTHERN STAR ENERGY INC., SB-2/A, 12/2/2005\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 2 Changes to these provisions\n\nelement 5 RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MODIFY AND TO SUPPLEMENT THESE GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS AT ANY TIME. THE CURRENT VERSION WILL BE MAINTAINED FOR VIEWING AS A HYPERLINK ON element 5's WEB SITE IN THE CONTROL PANEL. MOREOVER, element 5 WILL ANNOUNNOUNCE ANY CHANGES TO THESE TERMS VIA E- MAIL. WHITHIN 14 DAYS OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF CHANGED PARTICIPATION TERMS, AFFILIATE AND SOFTWARE PUBLISHER MAY OBJECT TO SUCH CHANGES. IF NO OBJECTION IS RECEIVED DURING THIS TIME, THE PARTICIPANT IS DEEMED TO HAVE ACCEPTED THE CHANGES AND THEY WILL BECOME PART OF THE EXISTING RELATIONS UNDER THE AGREEMENT.\n\n\u00a7 3 Correspondenceont>\n\nCorrespondence shall take place preferably via e-mail, which is accorded the same status as postal mail. Qualifying dates are always agreed as \"Receipt by Recipient\", unless otherwise noted. For e-mail, the receipt of the message on the destination mail server is deemed to be the time of reception.\n\n\u00a7 4 Independence of Relations under the Agreement\n\nThe parties to the contract shall operate their Web sites independently of one another and are solely responsible for the content, technology used, and design. This agreement may not be construed as establishing between the parties a company or an association, nor does it establish an employment relationship or a commercial agent agreement. The parties to this agreement are not authorized to act in the name of the other party and / or to accept offers or make any statements on behalf of the other party. As an exception to the previous sentence, element 5 is authorized to make statements on behalf of the Software Publisher pursuant to these T&C and the element 5 vendor agreement (formerly known as e-sales contract).\n\n\u00a7 5 Guarantee by the Party to the Agreement for its Web site\n\n(1) The Affiliate shall be responsible for the entire content of its Web site. The Affiliate guarantees in particular that (i) It will integrate advertising Material according to the provisions and instructions of the Software Publisher into that Affiliate's Web site insofar as said Material was transferred to the Affiliate; (ii) The material used the Affiliate's Web site will not contain any representations of violence, sexually related contents or discriminatory statements or representations with regard to race, sex, religion, nationality, handicap, sexual preference and orientation, or age, nor will said Material be unlawful in any way; (iii) The Material used on the Affiliate's homepage will not infringe upon the rights of third parties, particularly patents, copyrights, trademarks or other commercial protection rights as well as general personality rights and cannot be mistaken for the products of the Software Publisher and/or element 5 or a Web site operated by the Software Publisher and/or element 5; (iv) It will not send any e-mail without the express\n\nSource: SOUTHERN STAR ENERGY INC., SB-2/A, 12/2/2005\n\n\n\n\n\nconsent of the receiver(s) (no spam e-mails). (2) The Affiliate shall guarantee the above named properties of its Web sites and will pay defense costs and indemnify and keep fully indemnified the Software Publisher and element 5, its subsidiaries and its and their directors, officers, employees and agents upon demand from any and all claims, demands, costs, liabilities, losses, expenses, and damages (including reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and expert witnesses' fees) arising out of or in connection with any breach by Affiliate of its warranty set out in this clause.\n\n\u00a7 6 Limitation of liability\n\n(1) The parties exclude mutual liability for slightly negligent violation of obligations in connection with this agreement, with the exception of \u00a7 16 and \u00a7 5 (3) of this agreement. This includes in particular the liability exclusion for lost profit, the loss of data or interruption to or errors in the operation of the Web site of the Affiliate. The above liability exclusion also applies to the personal liability of employees, representatives and persons employed to perform the obligations of the parties to the agreement. The limitation of liability does not apply to claims arising through initial incapacity or in case of justifiable impossibility. (2) Any possible product liability claims are unaffected by the above limitations. Insofar as element 5 or the Software Publisher violates an essential obligation under the agreement, the obligation to pay restitution is limited to the damages that typically arise. (3) element 5 makes no guarantees in regard to the Software Publisher's software products offered via its Web site. Moreover, element 5 does not guarantee the Affiliate that the operation of its Web sites will be maintained without interruptions and without errors. Liability is expressly excluded for the consequences of such interruptions or errors.\n\n\u00a7 7 Agreement period / Cancellation\n\nThe term of this Agreement will begin upon acceptance of Affiliate's Program application and will end when terminated by either party of this Agreement. This Agreement is entered into for an unlimited period of time.

(3) element 5 is authorized to retain final payment for a reasonable time, minimum for 30 days after the end of the respective quarter, to ensure that the correct amount is paid.\n\nSource: SOUTHERN STAR ENERGY INC., SB-2/A, 12/2/2005\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiliate is only eligible to earn the Advertising Cost Compensation on sales of Software Publishers Products occurring during the term of this Agreement and fees earned up to the date termination will remain payable only if the related orders are not cancelled or returned.

To the extent working with Agents or other Third Parties is permitted under the R&D Work   Plan, should a Party wish to engage an Agent or any other Third Party in connection with the R&D Work Plan or any other work   under this Agreement, such Party must obtain in advance a written agreement by such Agent or other Third Party (i) to assign to   the Party all Inventions conceived, created or generated by the Agent or other Third Party, and (ii) to maintain all Confidential   Information in confidence as set forth in Section 5.2.

Each Deliverable shall be deemed to be completed once such   Deliverable has been Accepted (as defined below).   3.2 Free from Infringement. Without the consent of Stryker, Conformis shall not introduce any structure or   methodology in the Deliverables (including a Deliverable within a Product or a Stryker Product) that (1) raise a colorable   argument of patent infringement in the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale or importation of the Deliverable as such Deliverable   8   Source: CONFORMIS INC, 10-Q, 11/1/2019\n\n\n\nis intended to be exploited under the Other Agreements, (2) misappropriate any Confidential Information of any Third Party, or   (3) otherwise violate any Intellectual Property rights of any Third Party. For clarity, disclosure of a matter on the Disclosure   Schedules to the Asset Purchase Agreement shall not be deemed consent by Stryker under this Section 3.2.   3.3 Completion. After a Deliverable has been furnished to Stryker, Stryker (or its Agent designee) will be entitled to   analyze and test the Deliverable to determine if it operates in accordance with and otherwise conforms to the applicable   Acceptance Criteria set forth in R&D Work Plan. Conformis shall provide such assistance as Stryker may reasonably request in   such determination. Stryker shall have [**] (\"Acceptance Notification Period\") following the date the Deliverable is received by   Stryker to Accept or reject the Deliverable as described in Section 3.4.   3.4 Acceptance or Rejection. Respecting any Deliverable for Milestone #1 or Milestone #2, as set forth below, if   Stryker determines that a Deliverable operates in accordance with and otherwise conforms to the applicable Acceptance Criteria   pursuant to the R&D Work Plan, then Stryker will notify Conformis in writing that Stryker Accepts such Deliverable. If Stryker   reasonably determines that a Deliverable does not operate in accordance with or otherwise conform to the applicable Acceptance   Criteria, then Stryker will provide Conformis with a written notice of rejection within the Acceptance Notification Period   describing the defect in view of the relevant Acceptance Criteria and including sufficient detail with respect to such Stryker testing   and testing results as Conformis reasonably requests (\"Failure Notice\"). Conformis shall have [**] (or such longer period of time   as may be agreed between the parties in good faith should the scope and complexity of the applicable Deliverable warrant some   longer period of time) (\"Redelivery Period\") following the date it receives the Failure Notice to correct and redeliver the   Deliverable. If Conformis timely delivers a corrected version of the Deliverable within the Redelivery Period, then Stryker will be   9   Source: CONFORMIS INC, 10-Q, 11/1/2019\n\n\n\nentitled to repeat its acceptance analysis and testing process for the purposes of determining Acceptance as set forth in the R&D   Work Plan until such Deliverable operates in accordance with or otherwise conforms to the applicable Acceptance Criteria;   provided, however, that if Stryker properly rejects a particular Deliverable three (3) or more times in accordance with this Article   III, or if Conformis fails to deliver a version or corrected version, as the case may be, of the Deliverable within any respective [**]   period, Stryker may, terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.2(c) (in the event of such three (3) rejections, Stryker   \"Finally Rejects\" the Deliverable). Such termination, together with the provisions of Section 5.2 of the License Agreement,   constitutes as Stryker's sole remedy and Conformis' exclusive liability in the event of any such rejection or failure by Conformis to   deliver materially conforming Deliverables hereunder so long as such rejection or failure does not arise from Conformis' fraud,   willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith. Stryker shall be deemed to have accepted a Deliverable timely furnished to it   unless (a) the Deliverable fails to operate in accordance with and otherwise conform the applicable Acceptance Criteria, and (b)   Stryker provides Conformis a written Failure Notice within the Acceptance Notification Period in accordance with this Section   3.4 (any acceptance or deemed acceptance, described in this Section 3.4, \"Acceptance\" or \"Accept\"). Acceptance of a   Deliverable shall not constitute a waiver of any rights Stryker may have based on Conformis' warranties set forth in this   Agreement.   3.5 Payment for Milestones. Stryker shall pay to Conformis the following milestone payments for the development   work to be conducted hereunder if and when the following milestones are met, as follows:   (a) Milestone #1 - Within thirty (30) days following the date on which Stryker receives the first prototype of the Patient-   Specific Instrumentation delivered to it by Conformis in accordance with the R&D Work Plan, Stryker shall pay to Conformis a   total of two million U.S. dollars ($2,000,000); and   10   Source: CONFORMIS INC, 10-Q, 11/1/2019\n\n\n\n(b) Milestone #2 - Within thirty (30) days following the date on which there is a design freeze of the Patient-Specific   Instrumentation for the KIB Product in accordance with the R&D Work Plan, Stryker shall pay to Conformis a total of three   million U.S dollars ($3,000,000).   3.6 Payment. Stryker shall make all payments to Conformis required herein by wire transfer in accordance with the Wire   Instructions. Such payments are non-refundable and non-creditable except as set forth in the Other Agreements.   ARTICLE IV   RESTRICTIVE COVENANT   4.1 Exclusivity. Except as specifically provided in the Distribution Agreement, Conformis shall be prohibited from   developing or assisting another in developing, or causing another to develop, Patient-Specific Instrumentation for Off-The-Shelf   Knee Implants for any Third Party in the field of orthopedics until January 1, 2032 (or earlier, to the extent set forth in Section   2.3.3.4 or Section 2.3.5 of the Distribution Agreement), with the exception that Conformis (including any entity involved in a   Change of Control of Conformis, any such entity an \"Acquirer\"), may develop Patient-Specific Instrumentation for any Off-The-   Shelf Implants of Conformis, an Acquirer or any of their Affiliates. For purposes of clarity, the foregoing does not prevent   Conformis from granting any license, release, covenant not to sue or other immunity to any third party under any Patents, including   any such immunity that would authorize manufacture, use or sale of Patient-Specific Instrumentation for Off-The-Shelf Knee   Implants outside the Buyer Field.   ARTICLE V   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY   5.1 Inventions.   (a) Inventorship of all Inventions developed by either Party, or both Parties, in the performance of the R&D Program, shall   be determined in accordance with the inventorship laws of the United States, even to the extent such Invention is not pursued in   patent applications.

Conformis agrees   to assign and hereby assigns to Stryker all right, title and interest in and to all Improved Stryker Background IP in which ownership   in same has vested in   11   Source: CONFORMIS INC, 10-Q, 11/1/2019\n\n\n\nConformis by operation of law or by assignment by its employees or consultants; and to facilitate such assignment to Stryker,   Conformis agrees (i) to regularly ensure that its employees and consultants timely make any appropriate assignments to it of that   which constitutes Improved Stryker Background IP, and (ii) at Stryker's reasonable request, to execute and have its employees   and consultants execute, as necessary, all assignments and any other documentation necessary to perfect title in Stryker of such   Improved Stryker Background IP.   (c) All right, title and interest in and to the Improved Conformis Background IP and KIB Product IP (\"Joint IP\") shall be   owned jointly by the Parties. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Joint IP may be used freely by either Party or   its Affiliates and licensed to Third Parties by Conformis and its Affiliates, on the one hand, outside of the Buyer Field or by Stryker   and its Affiliates, on the other hand, within the Buyer Field, in each case, without the consent of, or duty to account to or notify, the   other Party, but, except with respect to external licenses of the Improved Conformis Background IP by Conformis or its Affiliates   to Third Parties, any external Third Party license shall be governed in accordance with the last sentence of Section 4.3(c) of the   APA. Each Party to whom ownership is to vest in Joint IP by operation of law or by assignment by its employees or Agents agrees   to assign and hereby assigns to the other Party an undivided one-half right, title and interest in and to all Joint IP; and to facilitate   such assignment, the Party possessing such ownership agrees (i) to regularly ensure that its employees and consultants timely make   any appropriate assignments to it; and (ii) at the other Party's reasonable request, to execute and have its employees and   consultants execute, as necessary, all assignments and any other documentation to perfect the undivided one-half right, title and   interest in and to the other Party of such Joint IP.   (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the foregoing does not constitute either (1) the grant by Conformis to Stryker   of any license or immunity of any kind with respect to the Conformis Background IP or Conformis Foreground IP, regardless of   the extent to which the Joint IP constitutes improvements to the Conformis Background IP or Conformis Foreground IP, (2) the   grant by Stryker to Conformis of any license or immunity of any kind with respect to the Stryker Background IP, or (3) the grant   by either Party of any license or immunity of any kind under any Intellectual Property rights owned by such Party, regardless of   whether the exploitation of the Joint IP would infringe such Intellectual Property rights. Neither Party shall assign a partial interest in   12   Source: CONFORMIS INC, 10-Q, 11/1/2019\n\n\n\nthe Joint IP or Joint IP Rights to any Affiliate or Third Party (i.e., neither Party shall create any additional joint owners of the Joint   IP), but each Party may assign all of its right, title and interest in and to the Joint IP and Joint IP Rights to an Affiliate or Third Party   pursuant to and in accordance with Section 10.2.   (e) Conformis shall promptly disclose to Stryker all (i) Improved Stryker Background IP, and (ii) Joint IP. Stryker shall   promptly disclose to Conformis all Joint IP.   (f) To the extent required and for the avoidance of doubt, Stryker hereby grants Conformis, and Conformis hereby   accepts, a non-exclusive license to the Stryker Background IP and Improved Stryker Background IP solely for purposes of   performing any obligations under this Agreement and the Distribution Agreement.   5.2 Confidential Information.
