These requirements may include those defined by the U.S. FDA's regulations At 21CFR314.80 (Post-marketing reporting of adverse drug experiences for drugs), 21CFR312.32 (IND safety reporting) 21CFR600.80 (Post marketing reporting of adverse experiences for biologics) 21CFR Parts 210 and 211 (\"current Good Manufacturing Practices\" or \"cGMPs\") with particular interest in 21CFR211.1.42 (Warehousing), 21CFR211.150 (Distribution), 21CFR211.204 (Returned drug) and 21CFR211.208 (Drug product salvaging), ICH Guidance for Industry: E6 Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guidance and/or others that may be appropriate for the particular project.   3. Scope   This Quality Agreement is to be applied to the activities performed by SCIEN, for HEMISPHERX as specifically defined by the Sales, Marketing, Distribution, and Supply Agreement January ___, 2016 (\"Agreement\") to which this Quality Agreement is an integral Exhibit. In the event of a conflict between the terms of the Agreement and this Quality Agreement, the terms of the Agreement shall control. Unless otherwise stated in these documents, SCIEN shall follow its Standard Operating Procedures (\"SOPs\") with respect to the activities it shall carry out in accordance with the Agreement. Copies of all relevant SOPs shall be provided to HEMISPHERX for review during audits.   4. Confidentiality   The information and procedures contained in this Quality Agreement are confidential and subject to the terms and conditions of the confidentiality provisions as set forth in the Confidential Disclosure Agreement September 22, 2014 (\"CDA\") executed by HEMISPHERX and SCIEN.   5. Terms   This Agreement between HEMISPHERX and SCIEN shall be in effect beginning the last date of execution set forth on the signature page to the Agreement (the \"Effective Date\") to which this Quality Agreement is Exhibit 2 and remain in effect until HEMISPHERX and SCIEN terminate the Agreement or it is superseded by a revised Quality Agreement executed by both parties.

Page 17 of 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  HEMISPHERX may perform audits for initial qualification of SCIEN as well as periodic audits and \"for cause\" audits. At mutually agreed upon times, HEMISPHERX may review standard operating and other quality control procedures and records and the records of SCIEN relating to the Agreement. Such routine and general oversight review is to be requested at least twenty (20) business days in advance, limited to two (2) persons, completed within one (1) to two (2) business days and shall be offered to HEMISPHERX one (1) time each calendar year. SCIEN will make every reasonable effort to accommodate the special circumstances that may arise pursuant to \"for cause\" audits. The following applies to all audits:   \u00b7 Prior to an audit HEMISPHERX will communicate to SCIEN the scope of the audit. \u00b7 HEMISPHERX will prepare a written report of the results of the audit and forward a copy to SCIEN.   SCIEN will provide a written response to HEMISPHERX's written audit report within twenty (20) business days of receipt of such report setting forth the corrective actions to be taken by SCIEN, if any, and a timeline for such implementation.   In the event of an inspection by any governmental or regulatory authority concerning the activities carried out under the Agreement, SCIEN shall notify HEMISPHERX promptly upon learning of such an inspection, shall supply HEMISPHERX with copies of any correspondence or portions of correspondence relating to HEMISPHERX's materials and shall inform HEMISPHERX of the general findings and outcomes of such inspections.   SCIEN and HEMISPHERX shall cooperate with each other during any such inspection, investigation or other inquiry, including applying reasonable effort, as might be practical, at allowing, upon reasonable request, a representative of HEMISPHERX to be on site during such inspection, investigation or other inquiry, and providing copies of all documents related to the inspection. Each party acknowledges that it may not direct the manner in which the other party fulfills its obligations to permit inspection by governmental entities   6. Dispute Resolution   If a dispute arises between the parties under this Agreement, the parties agree that, prior to either pursuing other available remedies, decision- making individuals from each party will promptly meet, either in person or by telephone, to attempt in good faith to negotiate a resolution of the dispute. If, within sixty days after such meeting, the parties are unable to resolve the dispute (or such longer time as the parties may agree) either party is free to pursue its legal remedies.   7. Definitions   Adverse experience: Any adverse event associated with the use of a biological or drug product in humans, whether or not considered product related, including the following: an adverse event occurring in the course of the use of a biological or drug product in professional practice; an adverse event occurring from overdose of the product whether accidental or intentional; an adverse event occurring from abuse of the product; an adverse event occurring from withdrawal of the product; and any failure of expected pharmacological action.   Disability: A substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions.   Life-threatening adverse experience: Any adverse experience that places the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as it occurred, i.e., it does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.   Labeled event: An adverse experience that is listed on the product insert as having been observed in patients who are receiving the drug product.\n\n{***} Confidential portions of this exhibit have been redacted and filed separately with the Commission pursuant to a confidential treatment request in accordance with Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.   Page 18 of 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Drug Product: A finished dosage form, for example, tablet, capsule, or solution that contains an active ingredient generally, but not necessarily, in association with inactive ingredients   Serious adverse experience: Any adverse experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-threatening adverse experience, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.   Unexpected adverse experience: Any adverse experience that is not listed in the current labelling for the biological or drug product. This includes events that may be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an event listed in the labelling, but differ from the event because of greater severity or specificity.   For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the labeling only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the labeling only listed cerebral vascular accidents. \"Unexpected,\" as used in this definition, refers to an adverse experience that has not been previously observed (i.e., included in the labeling) rather than from the perspective of such experience not being anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the pharmaceutical product.   Call report: A list of all questions, requests for circulars, and physician/patient complaints received by SCIEN's Clinical Support Department is prepared monthly by SCIEN staff and is forwarded to HEMISPHERX RA/QA Department.   Audit: A systematic examination of processes, controls and systems, operating procedures, reports, records and/or data to assess SCIEN's compliance with standards, regulatory submissions, SOPs; applicable laws, regulations, directives, standards and guidelines; the terms of this Agreement and other contracts in place defining the services being provided and to verify data integrity.   Good Clinical Practices (\"GCPs\"): Good clinical practice (GCP) is an international ethical and scientific quality standard for designing, conducting, recording, and reporting trials that involve the participation of human subjects. Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety, and wellbeing of trial subjects are protected, consistent with the principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, and that the clinical trial data are credible. ICH Guidance for Industry: E6 Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guidance.   Good Manufacturing Practices (\"GMPs\"): The recognized pharmaceutical regulations and requirements of regulatory authorities such as those defined by the U.S. FDA's regulations at 21CFR Parts 210 and 211.   Key Contacts: Persons at SCIEN and HEMISPHERX assigned to assure proper communication and follow-up in a timely manner within both parties' organizations. Names, titles and full contact information for Key Contacts shall be appended to this Agreement as Attachment 1 and should be maintained up-to-date during the course of the project.   Observation: A statement of fact made during an audit that is substantiated by objective evidence. HEMISPHERX categorizes observations as follows:   o Critical: May pose risk to patient or consumer or otherwise compromise the integrity or quality of the material, product, process, or service being provided. Other instances that could be defined as a critical observation include: A practice that poses an immediate safety risk to personnel; Quality System(s) missing or not in compliance with regulations, guidelines, or corporate policies.\n\n{***} Confidential portions of this exhibit have been redacted and filed separately with the Commission pursuant to a confidential treatment request in accordance with Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.   Page 19 of 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  o Major: Does not fully comply with regulations, guidelines or corporate policies and may pose unnecessary risks to the integrity or quality of material, product, process or service being provided. Other instances that could be defined as a major observation include: Likely or probable safety risk to personnel; Quality System(s) weak or needing improvement; repeated Minor deficiencies of a similar nature that indicate a systemic problem and therefore may be classified as Major. o Minor: Does not comply with regulations, guidelines, or corporate policies but does not directly impact the integrity or quality of the material, product, process, or service being provided. o Comment: Compliant with regulations, guidelines and/or corporate policies; however, the auditor comment serves as a recommendation relative to maintaining or improving a specific condition noted.   Out-of-Specification / Out-of-Trend (\"OOS / \"OOT\"): A result that is not within the established specifications or trend, whether these are qualitative or quantitative.   Standard Operating Procedures (\"SOPs\"): Procedures in effect at SCIEN that define the processes and controls by and under which activities are to be conducted to assure compliance with the appropriate Code of Federal Regulations.   7. Communications   To assure proper communication, notification and follow-up in a timely manner by both parties, \"Key\" contacts are listed in Attachment 1 of this Agreement. Key contacts shall have access to project managers and technical staff and, upon reasonable notice and as required, facilitate resolution of any issues. Every effort will be made by SCIEN to accommodate timely communications, including face-to-face meetings, with HEMISPHERX.   8. Change of Control   SCIEN will maintain and follow change control SOP(s) to ensure that changes to equipment, procedures, processes, etc. occur in a controlled manner and in compliance with requirements e defined by the U.S. FDA's regulations (see Section 2).

SCIEN agrees to keep HEMISPHERX fully informed of any and all communications with regulatory agencies that may affect the services being provided to HEMISPHERX by SCIEN.   This Agreement is not meant to supersede or replace controlled documents typically used to define and record the work to be conducted by SCIEN for HEMISPHERX. Specific requirements of this Agreement and/or any service contracts shall be articulated within SCIEN's current operating procedures and documentation systems.   9.

All payments shall be paid in Euros, and in the event revenue is earned by a Party (or its associated third parties set forth above) in currencies other than in Euros, then such Party shall convert said amounts each month into Euros based upon the exchange rate published by the Wall Street Journal as of the fifteenth day of such month or if such day shall fall on a non-business day then as of the first business day following said fifteenth day.   15\n\nSource: TOM ONLINE INC, 20-F, 5/1/2006\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Interest shall be payable on any amounts paid later than the date due hereunder at the prime rate as reported by the New York edition of the Wall Street Journal on the day the amount is due calculated from the date any amount is due until the date of receipt of the relevant sum by the applicable Party.\n\n5.3.3 The Parties agree to provide such further information relating to Adjusted Net Revenue as may be reasonably available and as may be reasonably requested by the other Parties by giving 14 days' prior written notice to the relevant Party from time to time.\n\n5.3.4 All sums payable to a Party under this Agreement shall be made to such Party by bank wire transfer to the account set forth in accordance with details given by such Party from time to time and shall only be treated as received when credited to such Party's account by its bank.\n\n5.3.5 All payments will be made without deduction, withholding, counterclaim or set-off of any kind or nature.

This Agreement, including the Exhibits attached hereto, and the Deed, constitute the entire Agreement and understanding between the parties to this Agreement and integrates and supersedes all prior discussions, agreements or arrangements between them related to its subject matter. No modification of any of the terms of this Agreement shall be valid unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative of each party to this Agreement. Upon execution of this Agreement by all parties to this Agreement, the Memorandum shall be deemed terminated and cancelled. Each party acknowledges that in entering into this Agreement, it does not rely on, has not relied on, and shall have no remedy in respect of, any statement, representation, warranty or other provision (in any case whether oral or written, express or implied and whether negligently or innocently made) of any Person (whether a party to this Agreement or not) which is not expressly set out in this Agreement and the only remedy available in respect of any misrepresentation or untrue statement made to such party shall be a claim for breach of contract under this Agreement except to the extent that the misrepresentation or untrue statement is repeated in this Agreement in which case any remedies for misrepresentation shall be unaffected and nothing in this clause shall operate to limit or exclude any liability arising from any fraudulent or dishonest statement, act or omission.\n\n14.4 Assignment.

A failure to exercise or delay in exercising any right, remedy or power provided under this Agreement or by law does not constitute a waiver of the right, remedy or power or a waiver of any other right, remedy or power. No single or partial exercise of any right, remedy or power prevents any further exercise of it or the exercise of any other right, remedy or power.

In the event any provision of this Agreement is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.\n\n14.11 Counterparts.

In the event that mPhase's use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo, in the          sole judgment of Lucent, may adversely affect Lucent's rights to the          mark shown on Schedule A or the marks and names LUCENT, LUCENT          TECHNOLOGIES or LUCENT INNOVATION RING DESIGN, Lucent may upon written          notification to mPhase, terminate this Agreement.\n\n4.       mPhase agrees that it acquires no rights to the Lucent Co-Branding Logo          nor to the marks LUCENT, LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES or LUCENT INNOVATION RING          DESIGN, by its use and that any use of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo by          mPhase inures to the benefit of Lucent.\n\n5.       mPhase agrees not to adopt any designation which is confusingly similar          to the Lucent Co-Branding Logo or Lucent's marks LUCENT, LUCENT          TECHNOLOGIES or LUCENT INNOVATION RING DESIGN. Any attempt to do so          shall be a breach of this Agreement and Lucent may terminate this          Agreement without notice in the event of such a breach.\n\n6.       This Agreement shall terminate in the event of a significant change in          the management or ownership of mPhase or in the event mPhase is the          subject of any bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n7.       Lucent is generally aware of the current quality of mPhase's Goods.          mPhase agrees to maintain the quality of its Goods associated with the          Lucent Co-Branding Logo to a level of quality comparable to the current          quality of their Goods.\n\n8.

In the event that mPhase becomes aware of any unauthorized use of the          Lucent Co-Branding Logo or other Lucent marks by third parties, mPhase          agrees to promptly notify Lucent and to cooperate fully, at Lucent's          expense, in any enforcement of Lucent's rights against such third\n\nSource: MPHASE TECHNOLOGIES INC, 10-K, 9/11/2003\n\n\n\n\n\nparties.

The Term of this Agreement will commence on the date above, and shall          continue for a term of one (1) year. mPhase shall have the right to          annually renew this agreement for a period of one year upon each annual          expiration with the written consent of Lucent, which written consent          shall not be unreasonably withheld. Either party wishing to terminate          the Agreement must give written notice to the other party at least          thirty (30) days prior to the desired date of termination.\n\n12.      Upon termination of this Agreement, mPhase shall immediately cease use          of the Lucent Co-Branding Logo, provided, however, that mPhase shall          have no obligation to remove such Co-Branding Logo from any Goods sold          prior to the date of such termination.\n\n-2-\n\n13.

CERES and IGER aim  to develop commercial biomass crops from leading Miscanthus lines via a collaboration with 2 major foci: I) propagation; and II) breeding. These  are described in turn below.\n\nI. Propagation.\n\nThe major barrier to profitable Miscanthus cropping is efficient and inexpensive propagation. In the UK, subsidy support makes [***] of  Miscanthus x giganteus an economically viable planting method. This is not the case in [***], where there is no government support for the crop  and initial [***] from which to generate planting material is extremely limited.\n\nIt is not commercially feasible to produce Miscanthus on a large scale in [***] from traditional [***] schemes. Success of Miscanthus crops for  large markets will be determined by development of\n\nCERES-IGER SCHEDULE 1\n\nPage 1 of 10\n\nConfidential Treatment Requested and the Redacted Material has been separately filed with the Commission\n\n      BETWEEN   CERES, INC. (\"CERES\"), a Delaware corporation, having its principal place of business at 1535 Rancho Conejo Blvd., Thousand  Oaks, CA 91320, United States of America, and\n\n\n\nINSTITUTE OF GRASSLAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH (\"IGER\"), a company limited by guarantee, registered in  England No. 473456 and a registered Charity No. 272150, having an office at Plas Gogerddan, Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, SY23 3EB,  United Kingdom\n\nA.   Unless otherwise specified herein, the terms of the CA shall apply to this SCHEDULE.\n\nB.   In the event of any difference between the terms of this SCHEDULE and the CA, then the terms of this SCHEDULE shall prevail.\n\nI.A.  Rationale:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncost-effective propagation technology, and the magnitude of success depends on the speed with which this technology can be developed.\n\nAll other lines of crop development research in this collaboration will be dependent on success with propagation.\n\nTo be successful, Miscanthus must be planted from small, homogenous propagules that can be cheaply and rapidly produced, flow-ably  transported, stored for months and consistently emerge after planting. In theory, the best propagule for Miscanthus production is seed. However,  propagation of Miscanthus from seed is complicated and difficult. Development of [***] Miscanthus varieties will be a [***] of the [***] of this  collaboration.\n\nAn alternative approach to seed in the short term is to [***] Miscanthus from [***] as is common in [***]. [***] is more feasible with decreasing  [***] and has not been thoroughly explored in Europe. The potential of [***] should be investigated from both an applied and basic perspective.  It was agreed that while the approach is more likely to work in [***], it should also include x [***] and at least initially [***].\n\nDevelopment of [***] and [***] techniques for [***] Miscanthus cropping systems will utilize a combination of theoretical and applied methods  in the lab, glasshouse and field.\n\nCERES-IGER SCHEDULE 1\n\nPage 2 of 10\n\nConfidential Treatment Requested and the Redacted Material has been separately filed with the Commission\n\nI.B.  Goal: Applied methods for effective [***] of Miscanthus hybrids.\n\n      I.B.i. Objective 1: Identify [***] techniques and optimize them with existing hybrids.\n\n      Methods: Screen [***], x [***] and other species at least initially for [***] ability with multiple techniques in a broad range of factorial field  and glasshouse experiments. Glasshouse experiments can be conducted year-round at IGER and at CERES in Thousand Oaks, CA.  Additional experiments may be conducted at other CERES locations added at a later date. Field experiments will be conducted [***] at IGER  and begin in multiple locations in [***] during the three (3) year period of this SCHEDULE.\n\n      I.B.ii. Objective 2: More basic genetic and physiological work aimed at characterising and understanding [***].\n\n      Methods: A series of experiments into the [***] of [***] with a focus on inducing plant growth from [***] ([***] and [***]) [***]. Work  should explore [***] cues ([***], [***], [***]) as well as [***] ([***]). Explore [***] and score in [***] if possible, to locate [***].  Evaluate candidate [***] (from Arabidopsis, [***] if possible and other species) promoting [***] frequency.\n\nI.C.  Goal: Applied methods for effective [***] of Miscanthus hybrids.\n\n      I.C.i. Objective 1: Demonstrate potential of [***] and create protocols.\n\n      Methods: Check [***] of [***] and [***] of a wide range of [***] in response to [***] and [***] with a combination of [***], glasshouse  and finally field experiments. Interpret results in context of [***] range, genotype and [***] conditions under which the [***] was [***].  Produce guidelines for effective [***] and [***].\n\nI.D.  Goal: [***] based systems for rapid [***] of germplasm and plants to be used in [***].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nII. Breeding\n\nMiscanthus is an unimproved plant species with great potential as an energy crop. [***] has not yet been fully collected and characterized.  Miscanthus species are capable of crossing with [***] \u2014 a characteristic that has long been exploited in [***] where Miscanthus germplasm is  used to [***]. The use of Miscanthus for biomass is a relatively new area, thus initial collection and evaluation of germplasm may discover lines  already suited to the commercial market, and will certainly provide the base for the breeding needed to develop [***] into dedicated bioenergy  crops. This breeding programme will employ traditional methodology to [***] and [***] for traits of interest. Molecular markers will be developed  to assist identification of traits and expedite development of elite lines. Major traits of interest include increased biomass production, altered  composition for improved conversion to fuel, [***] tolerance and seed suitable to produce [***] ([***]) [***].\n\nAs lines with commercial potential are identified they will be selected for direct field trialing at IGER and/or at CERES locations in [***] to speed up  commercial variety development.\n\nCERES-IGER SCHEDULE 1\n\nPage 3 of 10\n\nConfidential Treatment Requested and the Redacted Material has been separately filed with the Commission\n\n      I.D.i. Objective 1: Provide plants for [***] based [***].\n\n      Methods: [***] plants using clean systems for shipment to [***] in accordance with international regulations.\n\n      I.D.ii. Objective 2: Investigate [***] in [***] of lines potentially useful in breeding, including hybrids.\n\n      Methods: Evaluate the [***] capacity of breeding line candidates in response to standard or improved [***] techniques.\n\n      I.D.iii. Objective 3: Develop estimates of time and cost required to [***] plants in [***] based systems.\n\n      Methods: Conduct a desk study to compare the costs/benefits and barriers associated with large scale [***] methodology including [***].\n\nI.E.  Goal: Proof of Concept field trials of research findings in target locations.\n\n      I.E.i. Objective 1: Evaluate and optimize propagation techniques under commercially relevant conditions.\n\n      Methods: Use IGER and CERES infrastructure for field trialing methods in the UK and at multiple locations in [***] and elsewhere. These  should expand on research performed at IGER and test genotype by environment interactions, with a focus on potentially commercial  genotypes.\n\n      I.E.ii. Objective 2: Evaluate and optimize germplasm performance in the UK and in multiple [***].\n\n      Methods: Use IGER and CERES infrastructure for field trialing at multiple locations in the UK, [***] and elsewhere. These should expand  on research performed at IGER and test genotype by environment interactions with a focus on potentially commercial genotypes.\n\nII.A.  Rationale:\n\nII.   B. Goal: A complete and documented Miscanthus [***].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCERES-IGER SCHEDULE 1\n\nPage 4 of 10\n\nConfidential Treatment Requested and the Redacted Material has been separately filed with the Commission\n\n      II.B.i. Objective 1: [***] to [***] in [***].\n\n      Methods: In accordance with international conventions, e.g., the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD), [***] Miscanthus [***] from the  [***] of [***]. Document the phenotype and growing [***], using [***] to accurately record the [***]. [***] to [***] for [***] and  subsequent phenotype documentation.\n\n      II B.ii. Objective 2: Characterize full [***].\n\n      Methods: Document the morphological, physiological and [***] of interest in the [***] using consistent phenotyping nomenclature and  [***] compositional analysis. Develop molecular markers associated with phenotypic traits.\n\n      II.B.iii. Objective 3: Assess relatedness of plants identified as useful parents for hybrids.\n\n      Methods: Use molecular markers developed for traits of interest in combination with germplasm characterization data, particularly [***], to  select parents with desired traits that are also likely to present [***].\n\n      II.B.iv. Objective 4: Develop a dynamic warehouse to store data and develop systems to analyse data and support multidisciplinary  collaborative research.\n\n      Methods: IGER and CERES to consider best options for developing the database. Populate the database with the [***] and [***]  information [***]. As germplasm is characterized, integrate phenotype and marker data and use to facilitate choice of promising [***] lines  as well as inform the preparation needed to ensure [***] (e.g. [***]). As data become available from other components of the collaborative  research, such as field trialing and conversion analysis, it will be added to the database to allow PIs to synergistically design next step  experiments.\n\nII.C.  Goal: Improved Miscanthus hybrids for commercial use.\n\n      II.C.i. Objective: Select improved parents.\n\n      Methods: [***] within [***] using information from molecular markers and composition analysis to shorten and streamline the selection of  parents. Cross between [***] and evaluate hybrids to identify improved parents.\n\n      II.C.ii. Objective: Make crosses of selected [***] lines.\n\n      Methods: Appropriate germplasm will be selected for crossing using the database decision tool. Plants will be [***] to [***] in  glasshouses and [***] made both in the glasshouse and outdoors at IGER, depending on time of year. Improve efficiency of [***] and, for  [***], [***]. Determine [***] \u2014 and [***]. Send seed of [***] candidates and [***] to CERES locations for trialing.\n\n      II.C. iii Objective: Selection of superior [***].\n\n      Methods: [***] will be transplanted to field. Important morpho-physiological traits will be recorded over [***] years after which the best  genotypes will be selected, [***] and [***] into rhizomes. The value of early prediction of traits will be assessed. A mass selection  reservoir (MSR) will be maintained as a safety net and to contain interesting genotypes that do not justify commercial development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCERES-IGER SCHEDULE 1\n\nPage 5 of 10\n\nConfidential Treatment Requested and the Redacted Material has been separately filed with the Commission\n\n      II.C.iv. Objective: Field evaluation of hybrids.\n\n      Methods: From rhizomes taken in iii, replicated trials will be established. After [***] (or [***]) years, the best genotypes will be provided to  CERES to test at diverse locations for commercially relevant evaluation.\n\n      II D. Goal: Improved Miscanthus Varieties.\n\n      II.D.i. Objective: Explore new methods of breeding.\n\n      Methods: Set up and test [***] in terms of [***] and [***].

agreed upon for contract years 1 through 3. A contract year (\"Year\") is April 1 \u2014 March 31, starting April 1, 2007. CERES agrees to  provide funding for IGER's RESEARCH PROJECT activities covered by this SCHEDULE in accordance with Article 1.8 of the CA as set forth in the  Budget in page 1 of this Attachment B, taking into account what is provided hereinafter. Pay Costs, Other Recurrent and Other Costs are as in the  Budget. Overhead Costs will be payable as follows:\n\nPage 2\n\nConfidential Treatment Requested and the Redacted Material has been separately filed with the Commission\n\n  -    Each contract year CERES will pay [***]% of the overheads asked, (e.g. of the [***] pounds in Year 1), for the expected reasonable  performance in the various aspects of the program Year by Year and especially for all the items listed in the attached document. This  [***]% amounts to [***] pounds in contract Year 1.\n\n  -    Furthermore, CERES will pay for Year 1 an additional [***]% of the asked overhead ( i.e.[***]% in total of the asked overhead) for full  completion of the Year 1 items A and B listed hereinafter. This additional [***]% equals [***] pounds.\n\n  -    For Year 2 CERES will pay an additional [***]% of the overhead costs asked for full and successful completion of Year 2 items A and C  hereinafter.\n\n  -    For Year 3 CERES will pay an additional [***]% of the overhead costs asked for full and successful completion of Year 3 items A, B, C  and D listed hereinafter.\n\n  -    The MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE will bring forth recommendations to the Parties at the beginning of each Year for the items that IGER  should satisfy to obtain extra overheads, outlined in the framework above.\n\n  -    Assessment on achievements of the nominated items will be made at the end of each Year by the MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE and  recommendations made to the Parties. Upon agreement, CERES will respond to an invoice from IGER as agreed. Should some items in a  section not be achieved then the amount paid will be reduced on a pro-rata basis on the number of items in the section.

Additionally, Rogers shall not be required to pay any License Fees for VOD exhibitions of any Licensed Program occurring on or off premises that are made for the purposes of quality assurance or testing.

Such Masters shall at all times remain the sole property of Licensor and, within fifteen (15) days following the termination or expiration of this Agreement, Rogers shall either return to Licensor all such Masters then in its possession, or issue a certificate of erasure.     (b) To the extent any Master delivered by Licensor hereunder is determined by Rogers, in its sole discretion, acting reasonably, to be defective: (i) Licensor shall forthwith provide Rogers with a replacement Master; and (ii) if Rogers is unable to distribute and/or exhibit the Licensed Program on the availability date as a result of the defectiveness of any such Master, the License Fee payable in respect of such Licensed Program shall be reduced by 10% for the balance of the License Period.     9.

Page 19 of 38 *Confidential Treatment Requested\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3. Intellectual Property Infringement.\n\n11.3.1. Subject to Section 11.4, Sonos shall defend, indemnify and/or settle and hold harmless IAC and its Affiliates, and their officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents, successors and assigns from and against any and all loss, damages, liabilities, settlements, costs and expenses (including reasonable legal expenses and the expenses of other necessary professionals) as incurred, resulting from or arising out of any third party claim, action, suit or proceeding (collectively and individually, a \"Claim\") alleging that the Product (excluding any IAC Property) infringes any third party Intellectual Property Right, and shall pay all damages or settlement amounts finally awarded to the extent based upon such a Claim.\n\n11.3.2. Subject to Section 11.4, IAC shall defend, indemnify and/or settle and hold harmless Sonos and its Affiliates, and their officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents, successors and assigns from and against any and all loss, damages, liabilities, settlements, costs and expenses (including reasonable legal expenses and the expenses of other necessary professionals) as incurred, resulting from or arising out of any Claim alleging that the IAC Property or use thereof infringe any third party Intellectual Property Right, and shall pay all damages or settlement amounts finally awarded to the extent based upon such a Claim.\n\n11.4.

Indemnitee shall have the right to participate, at its own expense, with counsel of its own choosing in the defense and/or settlement of such Claim. The indemnification obligations of the parties in this Section 11 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any Claim if such settlement is effected without the consent of Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The failure to deliver written notice to Indemnitor within a reasonable time after the commencement of any Claim, if prejudicial to its ability to defend such Claim, shall relieve Indemnitor of any liability to Indemnitee under this Section 11.\n\n11.5. Pass-Through of Indemnities. If a party becomes the subject of a Claim of infringement with respect to a Third Party Component, to the extent the other party has the right to pass through an indemnity with respect to such Third Party Component, such other party shall pass through the indemnity to the party that is the subject of the Claim.\n\n12.0 CONFIDENTIALITY.\n\n12.1. Definition. \"Confidential Information\" shall mean any information that is transmitted or otherwise provided by or on behalf of the disclosing party, whether orally or in writing, to the receiving party during the course of its performance under this Agreement which is identified as \"Confidential\" at the time of disclosure or that should reasonably have been understood by the receiving party because of legends or other markings, the circumstances of disclosure or the nature of the information itself, to be proprietary and/or confidential to the disclosing party. All IAC Property, Sonos Property and Future Products, and any information related to such Future Products, shall always be deemed to be Confidential Information of the respective party providing such information. Confidential Information may be disclosed in written or other tangible form or by oral, visual or other means, including Page 20 of 38\n\n\n\n\n\ndocuments, computer code, prototypes, samples, plans and equipment. Confidential Information may also include information of a third party that is in the possession of one of the parties and is disclosed to the other party under this Agreement. \"Confidential Information\" shall not, however, include any information that (i) was publicly known and made generally available in the public domain prior to the time of disclosure by the disclosing party through no faults of the receiving party; (ii) becomes publicly known and made generally available after disclosure by the disclosing party to the receiving party through no faults of the receiving party; (iii) is already in the possession of the receiving party at the time of disclosure by the disclosing party as shown by the receiving party's files and/or records; or (iv) is obtained by the receiving party from a third party lawfully in possession of such information and without a breach of such third party's obligations of confidentiality.\n\n12.2. Agreement as Confidential Information. The parties shall treat the terms and conditions and the existence of this Agreement as Confidential Information. Each party shall obtain the other's consent prior to any publication, presentation, public announcement or press release concerning the existence or terms and conditions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sonos may disclose that IAC is manufacturing its Products to potential investors, partners and customers. The Parties specifically acknowledge that disclosure of this Agreement or the relationship contemplated hereby, without the prior written consent of the other party, would have a material, adverse impact on the other party's relationship with its existing manufacturing partner.\n\n12.3. Non-use and Non-disclosure. Each party agrees not to use any Confidential Information of the other party for any purpose except as necessary to perform its obligations under this Agreement. Each party agrees not to disclose any Confidential Information of the other party to any third party, except that, a receiving party may disclose the other party's Confidential Information to those employees of the receiving party who are required to have the information in order to perform under this Agreement and who have agreed in writing to confidentiality obligations at least as protective of the disclosing party as those set forth herein. If a receiving party is required by a final authorized order from a recognized and applicable government body or from a court with competent jurisdiction to make any disclosure that is prohibited or otherwise constrained by this Agreement, the receiving party will provide the disclosing party with prompt written notice of such requirement so that the disclosing party may seek a protective order or other appropriate relief. Subject to the foregoing sentence, such receiving party may furnish that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Information that the receiving party is legally compelled or is otherwise legally required to disclose; provided, however, that the receiving party provides such assistance as the disclosing party may reasonably request in obtaining such order or other relief. Neither party shall reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile any prototypes, software or other tangible objects that embody the other party's Confidential Information and that are provided to the party under this Agreement.\n\n12.4. Maintenance of Confidentiality. Each party agrees that it shall take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of the other party. Without limiting the foregoing, each party shall take at least those measures that it takes to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no case less than reasonable care (including, without limitation, all precautions the receiving party employs with respect to its own confidential materials). No party shall make any copies of the other party's Confidential Information except upon the other party's prior written approval. Each party shall reproduce the other party's proprietary rights notices on any such authorized copies, in the same manner in which such notices were set forth in or on the original or otherwise that can clearly express the other party's proprietary rights. A party receiving Confidential Information shall promptly notify the party disclosing such Confidential Information of any use or disclosure of such Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement of which the receiving party becomes aware. Confidentiality shall be maintained for a period of [*] after expiration of this Agreement. Page 21 of 38 *Confidential Treatment Requested\n\n\n\n\n\n12.5. IAC's Manufacturing Lines Building Sonos Products. With the exception of authorized contractors approved by the Parties required to perform equipment maintenance or other required work on IAC's manufacturing lines that are assembling and testing Sonos Products, no third party personnel will be allowed access to (including a walk-through or tour) IAC's lines that are manufacturing Products.

Termination for Convenience. Either Party may terminate this Agreement hereunder for any reason at its convenience upon one hundred eighty (180) days prior written notice. In such case, Sonos' sole liability shall be limited to payment of the amount due under this Agreement, all the Component(s) procured by IAC, and any finished and work-in-process Products provided such Components and Products liabilities were incurred in compliance with this Agreement.\n\n15.4. Termination or Expiration of Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the termination or expiration of this Agreement shall be without prejudice to any rights or obligations which have already arisen under this Agreement, its Exhibits or any Purchase Order prior to such termination or expiration.\n\n15.5. Transfer. If a termination notice is delivered pursuant to 15.2, 15.3, 15.4 or if Sonos decides to transfer the manufacturing of a Product from IAC during the Term of the Agreement, IAC shall cooperate fully with Sonos to effect the transfer of the manufacturing of the Products (without any obligation that IAC transfers IAC Property from IAC to Sonos, or a third party designated by Sonos, in order to help minimize any potential disruption in the continuity of supply. In the event that such transfer is the result of a termination notice pursuant to 15.2, 15.3 or 15.4 and such transfer is not completed by the termination date pursuant to 15.2, 15.3 or 15.4, the parties shall, acting reasonably and in good faith, agree to continue to cooperate fully to effect the transfer and extend the Term of this Agreement on such appropriate terms as the parties may agree for one or more ninety (90) day periods (the succession of which must be notified to IAC in writing within thirty (30) days of the expiration of the first ninety (90) day period and within the same timeframe for each period thereafter), until such time as the transfer is completed.\n\n15.6. Survival of Rights and Obligations Upon Termination. Sections 1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 7.10, 9.2, 9.3, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.4, 15.5, 15.6, 16 and Exhibit E shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement.

The Parties agree that any principle of construction or rule of law that provides that an agreement shall be construed against the drafter of the agreement in the event of any inconsistency or ambiguity in such agreement shall not apply to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Titles and headings to articles and sections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to affect the interpretation or construction of this Agreement.

Page 34 of 38 *Confidential Treatment Requested\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit F\n\nSonos Supplier Performance Review F.1 Introduction.\n\nSonos supplier management strategy is based on developing strong working relationships with its suppliers. The results Sonos seek will not occur from random sourcing or selecting suppliers solely on competitive quotations. It will result from working closely with the best existing suppliers to improve quality, productivity, cost, and all other elements of supplier performance.\n\nThe basic strategy entails establishing mutual performance expectations and metrics, providing supplier performance feedback, initiating corrective actions to ensure continuous improvements, and rewarding the best suppliers with the opportunity for future new business. The Sonos Supplier Performance Review program provides a framework for effective communication between Sonos and its suppliers regarding the specific elements of supplier performance. The result of establishing our expectations and supplier performance feedback will ensure maximum customer satisfaction and increased profitability for all contributors to the system. To accomplish these objectives, Sonos aims to: \u2022 Establish and strengthen long-term partnerships that result in mutual success between the Parties \u2022 Set expectations and metrics that are aggressive yet realistic and achievable \u2022 Utilize a team approach to achieve performance improvements \u2022 Be open to 2-way feedback and commit ourselves to continuous improvement, just as we expect from our supply and manufacturing partners\n\nSuccessful supplier performance in the areas of Quality, Business, Engineering, Supply Chain & Operational Excellence is expected and necessary for both parties to achieve repeat business, increased sales and profitable growth. F.2 Supplier Performance Review Metrics.\n\nIAC must maintain a competitive advantage by providing products of the highest quality and a competitive total cost, with operations that demonstrate best in class manufacturing, quality, engineering and supply chain innovation and execution.

On or prior to one month following the FID, Vapotherm shall provide a forecast for the next [* * *] consecutive months beginning [* * *] months following the FID. On or prior to the first day of each subsequent month, Vapotherm shall deliver to Medica an update to its previously submitted forecast of its expected purchases of Cartridges (each forecast delivered pursuant to this Section 2.l(a), a \"Rolling Forecast\").

Every month there after, Vapotherm will placed a PO for the following month to maintain a rolling [* * *] month commitment.\n\n(b) The forecast for any month specified in any Rolling Forecast may not be less than the total number of Cartridges for which Vapotherm, prior to delivery of that Rolling Forecast to Medica in accordance with Section 2.l(a), has submitted purchase orders in accordance with Section 3.2 specifying a delivery date in that month.\n\n2.2 Inventory.\n\nDuring the Term, Medica shall at all times maintain as safety stock that quantity of Cartridges equal to one (1) times the monthly average number of Cartridges ordered by Vapotherm during the immediately preceding [* * *] months.\n\nARTICLE 3 ORDERS, SHIPMENT, AND PAYMENT\n\n3.1 Price. The price paid by Vapotherm for any given shipment of Cartridges during the Initial Term is as stated in Exhibit A-1. No later than [* * *] days prior to the end of the Initial Term and each Renewal Term, Medica shall provide Vapotherm with reasonable documentation of its actual and direct costs in manufacturing the Cartridges (the \"Costs\").

First Offer for Development Opportunities. During the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on December 31, 2018 (the \"Development Term\"), each Party (the \"Offering Party\") agrees to provide to the other Party (the \"Receiving Party\") a right of first offer with respect to any proposed offer or arrangement, which the Offering Party (or its affiliate) desires to accept, under which the Offering Party or one of its affiliates would acquire the ownership of real property in the Market Area (the \"Development Property\") on which a Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort would operate (a \"Development Opportunity\").\n\nIf the Offering Party is required to offer the Receiving Party a Development Opportunity pursuant to this Section 1, the Offering Party must deliver written notice to the Receiving Party, together with reasonable due diligence information in the Offering Party's possession to enable the Receiving Party to evaluate the Development Opportunity (collectively, the \"Offer Notice\"). The Receiving Party will have ten (10) business days after receiving the Offer Notice to notify the Offering Party whether the Receiving Party exercises its right of first offer for that Development Opportunity. If the Receiving Party and exercises its right of first offer hereunder, and:\n\n(a) if the Receiving Party is Playa, then Playa (or its affiliate) and Hyatt's affiliate shall negotiate in good faith the terms of a management agreement and related documents under which Playa (or its affiliate) would manage a Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort on the Development Property (subject to a franchise agreement between Hyatt and the affiliate of Hyatt that would own the Development Property), provided that Hyatt's affiliate acquires the Development Property on terms acceptable to it within sixty (60) days after delivery of the Offer Notice, and\n\n(b) if the Receiving Party is Hyatt, then Playa or its affiliate shall negotiate in good faith the terms of a franchise agreement and related documents for the operation (and, if applicable, development) of the Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort on the Development Property, provided that Playa's affiliate acquires the Development Property on terms acceptable to it within sixty (60) days after delivery of the Offer Notice.   2\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Receiving Party declines its right of first offer with respect to any Development Opportunity, or fails to notify the Offering Party of its decision within the ten (10) business-day period described above, or if Hyatt's affiliate or Playa's affiliate (as applicable) fails to acquire the Development Property within the sixty (60)-day period described above, then the right of first offer with respect to that Development Opportunity shall expire, and the Offering Party thereafter may acquire, develop and/or operate (and/or grant any other person or entity the right to acquire, develop and/or operate) an all-inclusive resort or other business on the Development Property without any restriction under this Agreement, subject to any restrictions under any Existing Franchise Agreement or other agreement between Hyatt (or its affiliate) and Playa (or its affiliate).\n\n2. Introduction to Other Opportunities. If a third party (who is not an affiliate of Hyatt) approaches Hyatt during the Development Term with a proposed offer or arrangement, which Hyatt desires to accept, under which the third party would operate a Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort in the Market Area, and if that third party has not then already designated a management company to operate that Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort, then Hyatt agrees to provide notice to Playa and introduce Playa to that third party for purposes of enabling Playa (at its option) to negotiate for the opportunity to manage that Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort for that third party. Similarly, if a third party (who is not an affiliate of Playa) approaches Playa during the Development Term with a proposed offer or arrangement, which Playa desires to accept, under which Playa or its affiliate would manage an all- inclusive resort in the Market Area for that third party, and if that third party has not then already designated a brand under which that all-inclusive resort would operate, then Playa agrees to provide notice to Hyatt and introduce Hyatt to that third party for purposes of enabling Hyatt (at its option) to negotiate for the opportunity to provide that third party franchise rights to brand that resort as a Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort.\n\n3.

Except to the extent governed by the Federal Arbitration Act or other federal law, this Agreement and all claims arising from the relationship between Hyatt (and/or any of its Affiliates) and Playa (and/or any of its Affiliates) under this Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois (U.S.A.), without regard to its conflict of laws rules, except that any Illinois law or any other law regulating the offer or sale of franchises, business opportunities, or similar interests, or governing the relationship between a franchisor and a franchisee or any similar relationship, will not apply unless its jurisdictional requirements are met independently without reference to this Section 4.\n\n5. Dispute Resolution.\n\n(a) All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall to the extent possible be settled amicably by negotiation between the Parties within fifteen (15) days from the date of written notice by either Party of the existence of such dispute, and, failing such amicable settlement, shall be finally settled by arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (\"Rules\"). To the extent there is any conflict between the Rules and the Federal Arbitration Act as it pertains to such arbitration, the Rules shall prevail.\n\n(b) The arbitration panel shall consist of:\n\n(i) one arbitrator in the event the aggregate damages sought by the claimant are stated to be less than Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars (US$500,000), and the aggregate damages sought by the counter-claimant are stated to be less than Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars (US$500,000); or   4\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) three arbitrators in the event the aggregate damages sought by the claimant are stated to be equal to or exceed Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars (US$500,000), or the aggregate damages sought by the counterclaimant are stated to be equal to or exceed Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars (US$500,000).\n\nEach arbitrator (1) shall have no fewer than ten (10) years' experience in the international hotel business, (2) shall be licensed to practice law in the United States, and (3) shall not be a person, or an affiliate of a person, who has any past, present or currently contemplated future business or personal relationship with either Playa, Hyatt or any of their respective affiliates.\n\n(c) The place of arbitration shall be New York, New York (USA).\n\n(d) The language to be used in the arbitration shall be English.\n\n(e) The arbitrator(s) shall have the power to grant any remedy or relief that they deem just and equitable, including injunctive relief, whether interim and/or final, and any provisional measures ordered by the arbitrator(s) may be specifically enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. Each Party hereto retains the right to seek interim measures from a judicial or other governmental authority, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with the agreement to arbitrate or a waiver of the right to arbitrate.\n\n(f) An arbitral tribunal constituted under this Agreement may, unless consolidation would prejudice the rights of any Party, consolidate an arbitration hereunder with an arbitration under any Franchise Agreement between Hyatt (or its affiliate) and Playa (or its affiliate), if the arbitration proceedings raise common questions of law or fact. If two or more arbitral tribunals under these agreements issue consolidation orders, the order issued first shall prevail.\n\n(g) The Parties agree that the award(s) shall be binding upon Hyatt and Playa and each Party's parent company or companies (and all other Affiliates), principals, successors, and assigns, and that judgment on the award(s) may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction, and the Parties waive any personal jurisdiction objections for the purpose of any enforcement proceedings under the 1958 United Nations Convention on the Recognition of Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. The arbitrator(s) may not award damages in excess of compensatory damages or otherwise in violation of the waiver in this Agreement.\n\n(h) Any award(s) shall be payable in U.S. Dollars. In the event that monetary damages are awarded, the award(s) shall include interest from the date of default to the date of payment of the award in full. The arbitrator(s) shall fix an appropriate rate of interest, compounded annually, which in no event shall be lower than the prime commercial lending rate charged by Hyatt's primary bank (as Hyatt may designate from time to time), to its most creditworthy commercial borrowers, averaged over the period from the date of the default to the date of the award.   5\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) Any award(s) rendered by the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding on the parties, and each party hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by law any right it may otherwise have under the laws of any jurisdiction to any form of appeal or collateral attack or to seek determination of a preliminary point of law by any courts (including any court within the Market Area or elsewhere).\n\n(j) The prevailing Party in any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be entitled to recover from the losing Party all reasonable fees, costs and expenses incurred by the prevailing Party in connection with such arbitration (including any actions to enforce any award(s) or any of the provisions of this Section 5). If a Party prevails on some, but not all, of its claims, such Party shall be entitled to recover an equitable amount of such fees, costs and expenses as determined by the arbitrator(s). All amounts recovered by the prevailing Party under this Subsection shall be separate from, and in addition to, any other amount included in any award(s) rendered in favor of such Party pursuant to this Section 5.\n\n(k) Except as may be required by law, neither a Party nor its representatives nor a witness nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration or amicable settlement under this Section 5 (collectively, \"Dispute Information\") without the prior written consent of both Parties. Each Party shall ensure that the Dispute Information is not disclosed to the press or to any other third person or entity without the prior consent of the other Party. The Parties shall coordinate with one another on all public statements, whether written or oral and no matter how disseminated, regarding the Dispute Information.\n\n6. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior understandings and writings between the Parties. No Party may rely on any alleged oral or written understandings, agreements, or representations not contained in this Agreement. Any policies that either Party adopts and implements from time to time to guide them in their decision-making are subject to change, are not a part of this Agreement, and are not binding on them.\n\n7. Representations and Warranties. Each Party represents and warrants that neither the execution of this Agreement nor the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will (a) violate any provision of applicable law or any judgment, writ, injunction, order or decree of any court or governmental authority having jurisdiction over it; (b) cause a breach or default under any indenture, contract, other commitment or restriction to which it is a party or by which it is bound; or (c) require any filing, consent, vote or approval which has not been taken, or at the time when the transaction involved shall not have been given or taken. Each Party represents and warrants that as of the date hereof it has the full company power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform its respective obligations under this Agreement, and that such Party's execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of such Party.\n\n8. Amendment. The provisions of this Agreement shall not be supplemented or amended except by an instrument in writing executed and delivered by both Parties.   6\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Waiver. Failure of either Party at any time to require the performance by the other Party of any provision hereof shall in no way affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter. Hyatt and Playa will not waive or impair any right, power, or option this Agreement reserves because of any custom or practice that varies from this Agreement's terms; Hyatt's or Playa's failure, refusal, or neglect to exercise any right under this Agreement or to insist upon the other's compliance with this Agreement; Hyatt's or Playa's waiver of or failure to exercise any right, power, or option, whether of the same, similar, or different nature, with other Hyatt All-Inclusive Resorts or any other agreements between the parties and/or their affiliates; or Hyatt's or Playa's acceptance of any payments due from the other Party after any breach of this Agreement (unless such payments are made within any applicable cure periods).\n\n10. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and bind the permitted assignees, successors and representatives of the Parties, except that no assignment, transfer, pledge, mortgage or lease by or through either Party in violation of the provisions of this Agreement shall vest any rights in the assignee, transferee, mortgagee, pledgee, or lessee, as the case may be.\n\n11. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be void, illegal, or unenforceable under the law, all other provisions of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. The Parties are, in this event, obligated to replace the void, illegal or unenforceable provision with a valid, legal and enforceable provision which corresponds as far as possible to the spirit and purpose of the void, illegal, or unenforceable provision.\n\n12. Language and Counterparts.

All royalties paid to Developer shall be based upon Developer's list prices in U.S. Dollars, except as otherwise agreed in writing by Developer.\n\n     Software license fees associated with Software license agreements in which the sales cycle begins on or after May 1, 1994 (hereinafter \"New Software license agreements\") for Product sites located in the Territory, shall be allocated and distributed as follows:\n\n              Gross Software Revenue Generated     % to Distributor                  --------------------------------     ----------------                  Per Annum July 1- June 30\n\n              US$O -- $999,999                          40%                  US$1,O00,000 +                            50%\n\n     On July 1 each year, the gross software revenue generated figure will be reset to zero and the accumulation of software revenues will restart.\n\n     However, the foregoing allocation of such fees associated with the New Software license agreements involving a headquarter Product or other site licenses situated outside of the Territory may be subject to reduced percentages to Distributor due to royalties owed to other Developer entities, affiliates, or distributors located outside the Territory, who may also have participated in the sale. Each such situation will be evaluated individually and a final decision on the royalty due will be based upon each party's relative contribution and will be made in Developer's sole discretion. The general guidelines for such cases are outlined in Appendix E (Bergamo Rules).\n\n     Installation, consulting, and training fees associated with the Products are due and payable to the party performing the services.\n\n                                    5    6\n\n     License Renewal and Maintenance Fees will be split evenIy with 50% distributed to Developer and 50% distributed to Distributor, also subject to paragraph 4 of this section 2.3.\n\n     Distributor will submit a monthly report to Developer which accurately identifies the Software license fees, maintenance fees, and any other fees set forth in this Agreement (repons outlined in Schedule D). This report is due at\n\n\n\n\n\nthe earliest possible time, but in no event later than ten (10) days following the end of each calendar month Payment by Distributor of the applicable royalty fees to Developer shall accompany the report; provided, however, that Developer shall have the reasonable fight to inspect Distributor's books from time to time during the term hereof and for a one (1) year period after the termination of this Agreement for purposes of verifying the royalties payable to Developer. In addition, Distributor shall report the acquisition of each new license  for the Software system to Developer and will provide either an English translation of the End-User License Agreement or a completed contract extract schedule in the form of Exhibit D (Contract Summary Form) within one (1) day of accepting the order.\n\n     24  Inspection and Acceptance.             -------------------------\n\n     Distributor shall inspect all Products immediately upon delivery and shall, within seven (7) calendar days, give written notice to the common cartier and Developer of any claim for damages or shortages. Distributor shall give written notice to Developer within thirty (30) calendar days of delivery in the event that any Product does not conform with the terms of this Agreement. If Distributor fails to give any such notice, the Products shall be deemed accepted for all purposes of this Agreement.\n\n     2.5    Taxes.                -----\n\n     In addition to the Prices and other fees payable hereunder, Distributor shall record and pay any federal, state, local or other duties, withholding and excise taxes, now or hereafter applied on the sale, transportation, import, export, licensing or use of the Products including sales tax, value added tax or similar tax. Any taxes imposed by federal, state or any local government or any amount in lieu thereof, including interest and penalties thereon, paid or payable at any time by Developer in connection with Developer's license to Distributor, exclusive of taxes based on Developer's net income, shall be borne by Distributor.\n\n     Distributor shall co-operate with and assist Developer, as reasonably necessary, to obtain United States tax credits for any duties or taxes described in this Section 2.5 which may be credited to and/or recovered by Developer and applied by Developer to reduce its United States tax liability. In the event Developer obtains any such tax credits, Developer shall notify Distributor of the amount thereof and Distributor shall be entitled to apply such amount against future amounts payable by Distributor to Developer hereunder.\n\n                                    6\n\n7\n\n3.  MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT.     -----------------------\n\n     3.1   Distributor Support               -------------------\n\n     Distributor shall remain solely responsible for all installation, maintenance, consulting and support services to the End-Users with regard to the Products. Developer agrees to deliver to Distributor together with the first Order delivered to Distributor a copy of the Product to be used solely by Distributor's personnel providing installation, maintenance, consulting or support services to End-Users and shall only be used at Distributor's site. Distributor's failure to maintain the confidentiality of the Products pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement. As mutually agreeable, Developer, Developer's affiliates, or Distributor may each provide local support to the sites of multi-location clients, each on behalf of the other where the provisions of such support will enhance the quality of support provided to the client. Such services will be provided at the local billing rate or such alternative billing rate as shall be agreed between the parties. The party providing the support shall receive all revenues arising therefrom unless otherwise agreed.

DESCRIPTION OF DESIGNATED AREA C.     LEASE ADDENDUM\n\n                                          i\n\n                            bw-3 FRANCHISE SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n                                FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n       This Franchise Agreement (\"Agreement\") made this _____ day of ________, 19____, by and between bw-3 FRANCHISE SYSTEMS, INC. an Ohio corporation which has its principal place of business at 1919 Interchange Tower, 600 South Highway 169, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55426 (\"we\" or \"us\"), and __________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ _______________ (\"you\").  If you are a corporation, partnership or limited liability company, certain provisions of the Agreement also apply to your owners and will be noted.\n\n                                    BACKGROUND:\n\n       A.   Our parent company has developed a unique system (\"System\") for establishing and operating restaurants which use the service mark \"BUFFALO WILD WINGS\" and which feature chicken wings, sandwiches, and other products and beverages, which are all prepared according to specified recipes and procedures (\"Menu Items\"), some of which use proprietary mixes (\"Trade Secret Food Products\"), and has granted to us the right to sublicense the System to others.\n\n       B.   The distinguishing characteristics of the System include, without limitation, distinctive exterior and interior layout, design and color scheme, signage, decorations, furnishings and materials, special recipes, formulae, menus and food and beverage designations, Confidential Manuals, food and beverage storage, preparation service and delivery procedures and techniques, operating procedures for sanitation and maintenance, and methods and techniques for inventory and cost controls, record keeping and reporting, purchasing, sales promotion and advertising, Trade Secret Food Products, all of which may be\n\n\n\n\n\nchanged, improved and further developed from time to time.\n\n       C.   Our parent company is the owner of the trade names, service marks and trademarks \"BUFFALO WILD WINGS\", \"bw-3\" and other logos and commercial symbols, and such other trade names, service marks, and trademarks as are now designated (and may later be designated by us in writing) as part of the System (\"Marks\").\n\n       D.   We grant franchises to qualified candidates for the operation of \"Buffalo Wild Wings\" Restaurants offering the Menu Items and utilizing the System and Marks.  You desire to operate a Buffalo Wild Wings Restaurant using the System and Marks and have applied for a franchise, which application has been approved by us in reliance upon all of the representations you have made.\n\n       E.   You understand and acknowledge the importance of our high and uniform standards of quality and service and the necessity of operating the Buffalo Wild Wings business in conformity with our standards and specifications.\n\n                                    AGREEMENTS:\n\n       We and you agree as follows:\n\nI.     APPOINTMENT AND FRANCHISE FEE\n\n       A.   Subject to the provisions stated below, we hereby grant you a license to use the \"Buffalo Wild Wings\" Marks and System, and you undertake the obligation to operate a Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant facility featuring the Menu Items and providing sit-down, carry-out and other restaurant services (\"Franchised\n\n                                          1\n\nRestaurant\"), and to use the Marks solely in connection with the System, as it is currently established, and as it may be changed, improved and further developed from time to time, at one (1) location only, such location to be: 1) ____________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________, or 2)  at a location to be designated, as provided in Paragraph III within the area described on EXHIBIT B.  When a location has been designated and approved by you and us, it will become part of Paragraph I.A.1., as if originally incorporated in that Paragraph.  You shall not relocate your Franchised Restaurant without our prior written approval.\n\n       B.   You receive a Designated Area within which we and our affiliates shall not operate or grant to anyone else a franchise to operate a Buffalo Wild Wings or bw-3 Restaurant so long as this Agreement is in force and effect.  The Designated Area is described in writing and on a map attached to the Agreement as EXHIBIT B and is made a part of the Agreement.  You do not have any right to sublicense or subfranchise others within or outside of the Designated Area and do not have the right to operate more than one (1) Franchised Restaurant within the Designated Area.\n\n       C.   You acknowledge and agree that we have the right, in our sole discretion, to grant other franchises outside of the Designated Area as we deem appropriate.  Although we will not operate a Buffalo Wild Wings or bw-3 business within the Designated Area, we reserve the right, both within and outside of the Designated Area, to offer and sell at special events (at our option, if you elect not to participate in such events) or at wholesale, through channels of distribution distinct from those of a Franchised Restaurant, products and services which comprise, or may in the future comprise a part of the System, which products may be resold at retail to the general public by such entities. Further, you acknowledge that certain locations within the Designated Area are by their nature unique and separate in character from sites generally developed as Franchised Restaurants.  As a result, you agree that the following locations (\"Special Sites\") are excluded from the Designated Area and we shall have the right to develop (by direct ownership or franchising) such locations: 1) public transportation facilities, including airports, train stations and bus stations; 2) military bases; 3) sports facilities, including race tracks; and 4) amusement and/or theme parks.\n\n       D.   We and our affiliated companies shall not engage in catering and delivery services and activities in the Designated Area.  You shall not engage in catering and delivery services and activities outside of the Designated Area. We shall have no obligation to enforce similar covenants against any other System franchisee.  Other System franchisees shall be deemed third party beneficiaries of such.  You shall not offer for sale any Menu Items or Proprietary Products by means of Internet/World Wide Web programming or advertising.  We reserve the right to market and sell Menu Items and Trade Secret Food Products on the Internet/World Wide Web.\n\n       E.   You pay us a nonrefundable Initial Franchise Fee of ________________ _______________________ Dollars ($________) which is payable in full on the date of this Agreement.  The Initial Franchise Fee has been fully earned upon receipt and is nonrefundable in consideration of the expenses incurred by us in granting this franchise and for the lost or deferred opportunity to franchise others.\n\n       F.   You acknowledge that because complete and detailed uniformity under many varying conditions may not be possible or practical, we specifically reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to vary standards for any System franchisee based upon the peculiarities of the particular site or circumstance, density of population, business potential, population of trade area, existing business practices or any other condition which we deem to be of importance to the successful operation of such franchisee's business.  You shall not be entitled to require us to grant to you a like or similar variation.\n\n\n\n\n\n       G.   In consideration of our agreement not to grant another franchise in the area described in Paragraph I.C., you at all times shall use your best efforts to promote and increase the sales and service of Menu\n\n                                          2\n\nItems and to effect the widest and best possible distribution throughout the Designated Area, soliciting and servicing all potential customers and accounts for Buffalo Wild Wings food products and services.\n\nII.    TERM AND RENEWAL\n\n       A.   The term of this Agreement is for ten (10) years commencing on the date of this Agreement, unless terminated as provided by this Agreement.\n\n       B.   You have the right to renew the franchise for two (2) successive terms equal to five (5) years each, providing you meet all of the following conditions:\n\n            1.    You have, during the entire term, complied with all the provisions of the Agreement;\n\n            2.    The premises of the Franchised Restaurant meet our then-current standards for Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants and you are able to maintain possession of the Franchised Restaurant.  Before the expiration date of this Agreement you must bring the Franchised Restaurant into full compliance with the specifications and standards then applicable for new or renewing Buffalo Wild Wings businesses and present us with evidence satisfactory that you have the right to remain in possession of the Franchised Restaurant premises for the duration of the renewal term.  In the event you are unable to maintain possession of the premises of the Franchised Restaurant or if the premises do not meet our then-current standards, you may secure substitute premises approved by us and provided that you have furnished, stocked and equipped such premises to bring the Franchised Restaurant at its substituted premises into full compliance with the then-current specifications and standards before the expiration date of this Agreement;\n\n            3.    You have given us written notice of your desire to renew at least six (6) months but not more than twelve (12) months prior to the end of the term;\n\n            4.    You have satisfied all of your monetary obligations to us and our affiliates and have timely met these obligations throughout the term of this Agreement;\n\n            5.    You have executed for the renewal term our then-current form of Franchise Agreement (with appropriate modifications to reflect the fact that the agreement relates to the grant of a renewal franchise), which shall supersede in all respects this Agreement, and the terms of which may differ from the terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation, a different percentage Continuing Fee and advertising contribution; provided, however, that the percentage Continuing Fee shall not exceed seven percent (7%) during any renewal period.  You will not be required to pay the then-current initial franchise fee or its equivalent;\n\n            6.    You have complied with our then-current qualification and training requirements; and\n\n            7.    You have executed a general release, in a form prescribed by us, of all claims against us and our affiliates, and respective officers, directors, agents, shareholders and employees.\n\n       C.   Within ninety (90) days of our receipt of your notice to renew, we will furnish you with written notice of:  (i) reasons which could cause us not to grant a renewal to you including but not limited to any deficiencies which require correction and a schedule for correction by you; and (ii) our then-current requirements relating to the image, appearance, decoration, furnishing, equipping and stocking of Buffalo Wild Wings businesses, and a schedule for effecting upgrading or modifications in order to bring the Franchised Restaurant in compliance, as a condition of renewal.  Renewal of the franchise shall be conditioned upon your compliance with such requirements and continued compliance with all the terms and conditions of this Agreement up to the date of termination of the initial term.\n\n                                          3\n\n       D.   We shall give you written notice of our election not to renew the franchise at least three (3) months prior to the expiration of the initial or first renewal term of this Agreement.\n\nIII.   RESTAURANT AND LOCATION\n\n       A.   You shall operate the Franchised Restaurant only at the location specified in Paragraph I of this Agreement.  If the lease for the site of the Franchised Restaurant expires or terminates for reasons other than your breach, or if the site is destroyed, condemned or otherwise rendered unusable, or as otherwise may be agreed upon in writing by us and you, we will grant permission for relocation of the Franchised Restaurant within your Designated Area at a location and site acceptable to us.  Any such relocation shall be at your sole expense and we shall have the right to charge you for any and all reasonable costs incurred by us, and a reasonable fee for our services, in connection with any such relocation of the Franchised Restaurant.\n\n\n\n\n\n       B.   You shall be responsible for purchasing or leasing a suitable site for the Franchised Restaurant.  Prior to the acquisition by lease or purchase of any site for the premises of the Franchised Restaurant, you shall submit a description of the proposed site to us, together with a letter of intent or other evidence satisfactory to us which confirms your favorable prospects for obtaining the proposed site.  We shall provide you written notice of approval or disapproval of the proposed site within fifteen (15) business days after receiving your written proposal.  Our approval is not a determination or warranty that the proposed site will be a profitable location for the Franchised Restaurant.\n\n       C.   After receiving our written approval of the location of the Franchised Restaurant as provided in Paragraph III.B. above, you shall, subject to our prior approval of terms, execute a lease (if the premises are to be leased) or a binding agreement to purchase the site.  All leases pertaining to the Franchised Restaurant premises must contain an Addendum in the form of EXHIBIT C attached hereto, or contain terms and conditions substantially similar to those contained in EXHIBIT C that we approve.  You shall provide us with a copy of the executed lease for the Franchised Restaurant within five (5) days of its execution, and prior to its execution, provide us with a copy for our approval.  A copy of the executed Addendum must also be provided to us.\n\n       D.   You shall promptly after obtaining possession of the site for the Franchised Restaurant: (i) retain the services of an architect and a contractor each of whom has been approved by us; (ii) have prepared and submitted for our approval a site survey and basic architectural plans and specifications (not for construction) consistent with our general atmosphere, image, color scheme and ambience requirements as set forth from time to time in the Manuals for a Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant (including requirements for dimensions, exterior design, materials, interior design and layout, equipment, fixtures, furniture, signs and decorating); (iii) obtain all required zoning changes, building, utility, health, sanitation, liquor and sign permits and licenses and any other required permits and licenses; (iv) purchase or lease equipment, fixtures, furniture and signs as provided herein; (v) complete the construction and/or remodeling, equipment, fixtures, furniture and sign installation and decorating of the Franchised Restaurant in full and strict compliance with plans and specifications therefore approved by us and all applicable ordinances, building codes and permit requirements; (vi) obtain all customary contractors' sworn statements and partial and final waivers of lien for construction, remodeling, decorating and installation services; and (vii) otherwise complete development of and have the Franchised Restaurant ready to open and commence the conduct of its business in accordance with Paragraph XII of this Agreement.  Our approval of your site survey and architectural plans is not a representation or warranty of any type.\n\n       E.   You shall be required to periodically make reasonable capital expenditures to remodel, modernize and redecorate the premises of the Franchised Restaurant so that the Franchised Restaurant will reflect the then-image intended to be portrayed by Buffalo Wild Wings businesses.  All remodeling, modernization, or redecoration of the premises of the Franchised Restaurant must be done in accordance with the standards and specifications as prescribed by us from time to time and with our prior written approval.  All replacements must\n\n                                          4\n\nconform to our then-current quality standards and specifications and must be approved in writing.  Your total expenditures during the term of the Franchise Agreement for such remodeling, modernizing and redecorating will not exceed ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND Dollars ($100,000.00) adjusted for inflation from the date of this Agreement.

At least three (3) persons designated by you and approved by us must attend and successfully complete the training to our satisfaction.  The training will be at least three (3) weeks in duration and will be conducted at either our Cincinnati, or Columbus, Ohio training facilities or at such other place as we may designate.  The training program covers material aspects of the operation of a Buffalo Wild Wings business, including financial controls, general bookkeeping procedures, food preparation, service and operational techniques, familiarization with recipes and cooking procedures, marketing and advertising techniques, sanitation and maintenance procedures, deployment of labor, and maintenance of quality standards.  We reserve the right to provide less training if you have one or more Franchised Restaurants in operation.  All expenses incurred by you and your employees in attending the program, including without limitation, travel costs, room and board expenses, and the employee compensation shall be your sole responsibility.\n\n       B.   We will, from time to time upon your written request, make available, at your expense, training for additional managers designated by you and approved by us.  Such training shall take place at our Cincinnati, or Columbus, Ohio training facilities or such other place as we may designate.  You acknowledge that the time period within which we provide additional training will be subject to available openings in our regular training program with preference being given to initial training for new franchisees.\n\n       C.   We will schedule the opening of your Franchised Restaurant.  For one (1) week prior to and one (1) week concurrent with the commencement of operations of the Franchised Restaurant, we will furnish to you, at your\n\n\n\n\n\nRestaurant and at our expense, one (1) or more of our representatives for the purpose of training your employees and management team in the operation of a Franchised Restaurant.  During this period, the representatives will assist in establishing and standardizing procedures and techniques essential to the operation of a Buffalo Wild Wings business.  If you request additional assistance from us in order to facilitate the opening of the Franchised Restaurant, and if, we, in our discretion, deem it necessary, feasible and appropriate to comply with the request, you will reimburse us for our expenses in providing such additional assistance, which may include our then-current service fee.  You agree that during the week preceding the opening, you will have four (4) full days during which the Restaurant is fully operational and will host two (2) opening parties.\n\n       D.   If we determine, in our sole discretion, that you or your manager is unable to satisfactorily complete the required training program, you will have thirty (30) days to provide an alternate person to complete the training program at your sole expense.  At least three (3) persons actively involved in the management and operation of the Franchised Restaurant must successfully complete the training program.  If you fail to provide three (3) persons who can complete the training program, we will have the right to terminate this Agreement and you will not be entitled to a refund of any portion of the franchise fees paid.\n\n       E.   From time to time we may provide and if we do, may require that previously-trained and experienced franchisees, their managers and/or employees attend and successfully complete refresher training programs or seminars to be conducted at our training facility or at such other place as we shall designate. Attendance at such refresher training programs or seminars will be at your sole expense, provided, however, that attendance will not be required at more than two (2) such programs in any calendar year.\n\n                                          5\n\nV.     PROPRIETARY MARKS\n\n       A.   You acknowledge that our parent company is the owner of all right, title and interest together with all the goodwill of the Marks and has licensed the use of such Marks to us with the right to sublicense others.  You further acknowledge that your right to use the Marks is derived solely from this Agreement and is limited to the conduct of business by you pursuant to and in compliance with this Agreement and all applicable standards, specifications, and operating procedures prescribed by us from time to time during the term of the Agreement.  Any unauthorized use of the Marks by you is a breach of this Agreement and an infringement of the rights of us in and to the Marks.  You acknowledge that your usage of the Marks and any goodwill established by your use of the Marks shall inure to the exclusive benefit of us and our affiliate, and that this Agreement does not confer any goodwill or other interests in the Marks upon you.  Any developments and improvements by you relating to the Marks or the System shall be our sole property.  You will not, at any time during the term of this Agreement or after its termination or expiration, contest the validity or ownership of any of the Marks or assist any other person in contesting the validity or ownership of the Marks.  All provisions of this Agreement applicable to the Marks apply to any and all additional trademarks, service marks, and commercial symbols authorized for use by and licensed to you by us after the date of this Agreement.\n\n       B.   You will not use any Mark or portion of any Mark as part of a corporate or trade name, or with any prefix, suffix, or other modifying words, terms, designs, or symbols, or in any modified form.  You will not use any Mark in connection with the sale of any unauthorized product or service or in any other manner not expressly authorized in writing by us.  You shall give such notices of trademark and service mark registrations as we specify and to obtain such fictitious or assumed name registrations as may be required under applicable law.  Your use of any of the Marks on the Internet/World Wide Web (including any Home Page) or any other medium must have our prior written approval.  We reserve the right to prohibit your use of the Marks on the Internet.\n\n       C.

You shall also notify us of any action, claim or demand against you relating to the Marks within ten (10) days after you receive notice of said action, claim or demand.  Upon receipt of timely notice of an action, claim or demand against you relating to the Marks, we and our affiliate shall have the sole right and duty to defend any such action.  We and our affiliate will have the exclusive right to contest or bring action against any third party regarding the third party's use of any of the Marks and will exercise such right in our and our affiliate's sole discretion.  In any defense or prosecution of any litigation relating to the Marks or components of the System undertaken by us, you shall cooperate in all respects with us and our affiliate and execute any and all documents and take all actions as may be desirable or necessary in the opinion of our counsel, to carry out such defense or prosecution.  Both parties shall make every effort consistent with the foregoing to protect, maintain, and promote the Marks as identifying the System and only the System.\n\n       D.   If, in our sole discretion, it becomes advisable at any time, for us to modify or discontinue use of any Mark, and/or use one or more additional or substitute trade names, trademarks, service marks, or other commercial symbols, either systemwide or with respect to use by any selected franchisee, you will comply with our directions within a reasonable time after notice to you.  We will have no liability or obligation whatsoever with respect to your modification or discontinuance of any Mark.\n\n       E.   In order to preserve the validity and integrity of the Marks and\n\n\n\n\n\ncopyrighted material licensed to you and to assure that you are properly employing the same in the operation of your Franchised Restaurant, we and our agents have the right of entry and inspection of your premises and operating procedures at all reasonable times.  We will have the right to observe the manner in which you are rendering your services and conducting your operations, to confer with your employees and customers, and to select Menu Items, ingredients, food and\n\n                                          6\n\nnon-food products, beverages, and other items, products, delivery vehicles, products and supplies for test of content and evaluation purposes to make certain that the Menu Items, ingredients, food and non-food products, beverages and other items, products, delivery vehicles, materials and supplies are satisfactory and meet our quality control provisions and performance standards.\n\nVI.    CONFIDENTIAL MANUALS\n\n       A.   We will loan to you during the term of the franchise one (1) copy of our Confidential Operations Manual and other confidential manuals and written materials (all of which are collectively referred to herein as the \"Manuals\") containing reasonable, mandatory and suggested specifications, standards, operating procedures and rules prescribed from time to time by us for Buffalo Wild Wings businesses and information relative to your other obligations.  You will not at any time, without our prior written consent, copy, duplicate, record or otherwise reproduce the Manuals in whole or in part or otherwise make the same available to any person.  Any authorized duplication or copying of any of the Manuals shall be performed by us at your expense.  We have the right to add to and otherwise modify, combine, or replace the Manuals from time to time to reflect changes in the specifications, standards, operating procedures and rules prescribed by us for Buffalo Wild Wings businesses, provided that no such addition or modification shall alter your fundamental status and rights under this Franchise Agreement.\n\n       B.   The Manuals shall at all times remain our sole property and shall promptly be returned upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n       C.   The Manuals contain our proprietary information which you shall keep confidential both during the term of the franchise and subsequent to the expiration and/or termination of the franchise.  You will at all times insure that your copy of the Manuals are available at the Franchised Restaurant premises in a current and up-to-date manner.  At all times that the Manuals are not in use by authorized personnel, you will maintain the Manuals in a locked receptacle at the premises of the Franchised Restaurant, and will only grant authorized personnel, as defined in the Manuals, access to the key or lock combination of such receptacle.  In the event of any dispute as to the contents of the Manuals, the terms of the master copy of the Manuals maintained by us at our home office will be controlling.\n\nVII.        CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\n\n       A.   You acknowledge that your entire knowledge of the operation of a Buffalo Wild Wings business, including, without limitation, the method of preparation of Menu Items and other food products, and other specifications, recipes, standards and operating procedures of a Buffalo Wild Wings business is derived from information disclosed to you by us and that such information is proprietary, confidential and our trade secret.  You will maintain the absolute confidentiality of all such information during and after the term of the franchise and you will not use any such information in any other business or in any manner not specifically authorized or approved in writing by us.\n\n       B.   You will divulge such confidential information only to the extent and only to such of your employees as must have access to it in order to operate the Franchised Restaurant.  Any and all information, knowledge and know-how, including, without limitation, drawings, materials, equipment, techniques, restaurant systems, product formulae, recipes and other data which we designate as confidential will be deemed confidential for purposes of this Agreement, except information: 1) which you can demonstrate lawfully came to your attention prior to disclosure thereof by us, or 2) which, at the time of disclosure by us to you, had lawfully become a part of the public domain, through publication or communication by others, or 3) which, after disclosure to you by us, lawfully becomes a part of the public domain, through publication or communication by others.\n\n                                          7\n\n       C.   Due to the special and unique nature of our confidential information, Marks and Manuals, you acknowledge that we will be entitled to immediate equitable remedies, including but not limited to, restraining orders and injunctive relief in order to safeguard our proprietary, confidential, unique, and special information and you acknowledge that money damages alone would be an insufficient remedy with which to compensate us for any breach of the terms of Paragraph V, VI and VII of this Agreement.  All of your employees having access to our confidential and proprietary information and all of your shareholders, directors, officers, partners and/or members will be required to execute non-disclosure agreements in the form acceptable to us.\n\nVIII.       MODIFICATION OF THE SYSTEM\n\n       You acknowledge that from time to time we may change or modify the System presently identified by the Marks, including, without limitation, the adoption and use of new or modified trade names, trademarks, service marks or copyrighted\n\n\n\n\n\nmaterials, new Menu Items, new products, new equipment or new techniques.  You will accept, use and display for the purpose of this Agreement any such changes in the System, as if they were part of this Agreement at the time of execution. You will make such expenditures as are reasonably required by such changes or modifications in the System.  Except as directed by us, you will not change, modify or alter the System in any way.\n\nIX.         ADVERTISING\n\n       Recognizing the value of advertising and the importance of the standardization of advertising and promotion to the furtherance of the goodwill and the public image of Buffalo Wild Wings businesses, you agree:\n\n       A.   Before using any promotional and advertising materials, you will submit to us or our designated agency, for our prior approval, all information pertaining to promotional materials and advertising initiated by you, including, but not limited to, newspapers, radio and television advertising, Internet or any other medium, specialty and novelty items, signs, boxes, napkins, bags and wrapping papers.  In the event written disapproval of any such advertising and promotional material has not been given by us to you within twenty (20) days from the date such information has been received by us, the materials will be deemed approved.  Your failure to conform with these provisions and subsequent nonaction by us to require you to cure or remedy any such failure and default will not be deemed a waiver of future or additional failures and defaults by you under this provision and/or any other provision of this Agreement.  The submission of advertising information to us for our approval will not affect your right to determine the prices at which you sell your products and/or services.\n\n       B.   You will contribute to the Buffalo Wild Wings Advertising and Development Fund (\"Fund\") (which may be one of several regional Funds, if we elect to establish separate Funds to serve various regions in which multiple franchisees are located) an amount equal to three percent (3%) of your Gross Sales, as defined in Paragraph X.  Your required payments to the Fund will be made on or before the fifteenth day of the month for the preceding month.  These contributions may be withdrawn from your bank account as provided in Paragraph X.  We will use such funds to conduct local, regional or national advertising. Such payments shall be made in addition to and exclusive of any sums that you may be required to spend on system or grand opening advertising and promotion. The Fund shall be maintained and administered by us or our designee, as follows:\n\n            1.    We will oversee all advertising programs and have sole discretion over the creative concepts, materials and media used in such programs including the placement and allocation.  We will use the Fund to conduct national advertising, and/or, if regional Funds are developed, to conduct regional or local advertising on your behalf, at our sole discretion.  We may also use such funds to conduct advertising in your local advertising market. However, we cannot and do not ensure that any particular franchisee will benefit directly or pro rata from the placement of advertising.\n\n                                          8\n\n            2.    For each of our company-owned and affiliate-owned Restaurants (except Special Sites identified in Paragraph I.C.) offering products and services similar to the Franchised Restaurant we will make contributions to the Fund or to regional Funds equivalent to the contributions required of Franchised Restaurants within the System or, if applicable, region in which the company-owned or affiliate-owned store is located.\n\n            3.    We will administer and control the Fund and we will have the absolute and unilateral right to determine how, when and where the monies in the Fund will be spent.  This includes the right to use Fund monies for (1) the creation, development and production of advertising and promotional materials, (2) any marketing or related research and development, and (3) advertising and marketing expenses, including without limitation, the absolute right to purchase and pay for product and food research and development, advertising materials, production costs, brochures, ad slicks, radio, film and television commercials, videotapes, newspaper, magazine and other print advertising, direct mail pieces, photographer costs, photographs, pictures, designs, services provided by advertising agencies, public relations firms or other marketing, research or consulting firms or agencies, market research and marketing surveys, menu design and graphics, customer incentive programs, sponsorships, marketing meetings and sales incentives, development of Home Pages on the Internet, Internet access provider costs, Internet/World Wide Web programming and advertising, subscriptions to industry newsletters or magazines, marketing or industry studies, books and research materials, administrative costs and salaries for marketing support personnel.  All sums paid by you to the Fund will be maintained in a separate account from our other funds and shall not be used to defray any of our general operating expenses, except for such reasonable administrative costs and overhead, if any, as we may incur in activities reasonably related to the administration or direction of the Fund and advertising programs including, without limitation, costs incurred in collecting and accounting for assessments for the Fund.\n\n            4.    It is our intent that all contributions to the Fund will be expended for advertising and promotional purposes during our fiscal year within which contributions are made.  Any monies not expended in the fiscal year in which they were contributed will be applied and used for Fund expenses in the following year.\n\n            5.    Although we intend the Fund to be of perpetual duration, we have the right to terminate the Fund.  We will not terminate the Fund, however, until all monies in the Fund have been expended for advertising and promotional purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n            6.    An unaudited accounting of Fund contributions and expenditures will be prepared annually and will be made available to you upon request.  At our option, any such annual accounting may include an audit of the contributions and expenditures of the Fund prepared by an independent certified public accountant selected by us and prepared at the expense of the Fund.\n\n            7.    Once you make contributions to the Fund, all such monies will be used as required by this Paragraph IX and will not be returned to you.        C.   In addition to your contributions to the Fund, you may be required to spend up to two percent (2%) of your Gross Sales on approved local advertising.  We may direct that your local advertising expenditures be made either individually or to a local advertising group as described below.\n\n            1.    We shall have the right to designate local advertising markets and you will participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs in your designated local advertising market as described in this Paragraph.  Each Buffalo Wild Wings and bw-3 Restaurant (except Special Sites identified in Paragraph I.C.) within the designated local advertising area shall be a member of the local advertising group and each member shall have one vote on all matters requiring a vote.  We reserve the right to designate the Bylaws which will govern the operation of local advertising groups.\n\n                                          9\n\n            2.    If we direct you to spend your advertising funds locally, all such expenditures will be made directly by you or the local advertising group, subject to approval and direction by us or our designated advertising agency. You acknowledge that we may direct local advertising to be spent according to a seasonally adjusted schedule; however, such expenditures shall not exceed two percent (2%) of your annual Gross Sales.  You shall furnish to us an accurate accounting of all expenditures on local advertising and promotion.\n\n            3.    You will submit documentation of your advertising expenditures at such times and in such form as we designate.  If you fail to make any required advertising expenditures, we have the right to require you to contribute the amount of any deficiency to the Fund to be used by us for general advertising and promotion.\n\n       D.   We may require you to expend up to FIVE THOUSAND Dollars ($5,000) on newspaper, direct mail or advertising through other media prior to your opening and during your initial ninety (90) days of operation of the Franchised Restaurant.  We retain the right to collect such funds directly from you and expend the funds on your behalf.  Such advertising and promotion will be designated as \"Grand Opening\" advertising and promotion and will be conducted in accordance with the specifications set forth in the Manuals.\n\n       E.   You must carry and offer for sale to your customers a representative supply of trademarked clothing.  We may, from time to time, develop and market special promotional items which will be made available to you at our cost plus a reasonable mark up and you will maintain a representative inventory of such promotional items to meet public demand.  You will have the right to purchase alternative promotional items provided that such alternative goods conform to the specifications and quality standards established by us.  You will, on an annual basis, participate in a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the promotional programs introduced by us from time to time.  You will participate in the specific promotional programs designated by us.\n\n       F.   You will maintain a business phone and advertise continuously in the classified or Yellow Pages of a local telephone directory approved by us or such other directories under the listing \"Restaurant\", or such other listings as deemed appropriate by us using mats of the type and size approved in advance by us.  We reserve the right to require you to advertise in more than one local telephone directory.  When more than one (1) Buffalo Wild Wings and/or bw-3 restaurant serves a metropolitan area, classified advertisements shall list all such restaurants operating within the distribution area of the classified directories, and you shall contribute your equal share in the cost of such advertisement.\n\n       G.   You will not use in advertising or any other form of promotion, or in any manner any of the marks without the appropriate -Registered Trademark- registration mark or the designations TM or SM where applicable.\n\nX.     CONTINUING FEE\n\n       A.   You will pay us without offset, credit or deduction of any nature, so long as this Agreement is in effect, a monthly Continuing Fee equal to five percent (5%) of the Gross Sales derived from the Franchised Restaurant.  The Continuing Fee will be paid monthly in the manner specified below or as otherwise prescribed in the Manuals.\n\n            1.    We must receive from you within five (5) days after the end of each month, a correct statement of your Gross Sales for the preceding fiscal month as determined by us on a form approved by us and signed by you.  Each monthly statement of Gross Sales shall be accompanied by the Continuing Fee payment based on the Gross Sales reported in the statement so submitted.  You will make available to us all original books and records that we may deem necessary to ascertain your Gross Sales for reasonable inspection at reasonable times.\n\n                                          10\n\n            2.    The term \"Gross Sales\", as used in this Agreement, means and\n\n\n\n\n\nincludes the total amount of all revenue from the sale of services, products and merchandise and all income of every kind and nature related to the Franchised Restaurant whether or not sold or performed at or from the Franchised Restaurant and the proceeds from all games, cover charges, service, license, use and similar fees collected by the Franchised Restaurant.  Gross sales do not include any sales tax, use tax, or service taxes collected and paid to the appropriate taxing authority.\n\n       B.   Prior to the opening of your Restaurant (and thereafter as requested by us), you shall execute and deliver to us, our bank(s) and your bank, as necessary, all forms and documents that we may request to permit us to debit your account, either by check, via electronic funds transfer or other means or such alternative methods as we may designate (\"Payment Methods\").  You must comply with all procedures specified by us from time to time to take such actions as we may request to assist in utilizing any of the Payment Methods.  We may use the Payment Methods to collect the amount of each month's Continuing Fee, Advertising Contributions, and any other amounts due to us or our affiliates under this Agreement or otherwise.  The Continuing Fee shall be withdrawn from your designated bank account by electronic fund transfer on the fifth of each month for the previous month, or if the fifth falls on a weekend or bank holiday, then on the next business day.  Advertising Contributions will be withdrawn on the fifteenth of each month or on the next business day. Payments for commissary purchases will be debited one business day after products are delivered to the Restaurant.  We will determine your Gross Sales by means of the approved information system, or if we are unable to do so, you shall report your Gross Sales in writing on or before the fifth day of the month for the preceding month.  You shall notify us at least twenty (20) days before closing or changing the account against which such debits are to be made.  If such account is closed or ceases to be used, you shall immediately provide all documents and information necessary to permit us to debit the amounts due from an alternative account.  You acknowledge that these requirements are only a method to facilitate prompt and timely payment of amounts due and shall not affect any obligation or liability for amounts owed.  If for any reason your account cannot be electronically debited, you shall submit payments by check (certified or cashier's check if requested by us) on or before the dates when due.  You shall indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against all claims, damages, losses, costs and expenses resulting from any dishonored debit against your account, regardless whether resulting from the act or omission of you or your bank; provided that you shall not be obligated to indemnify us for any dishonored debit caused by our negligence or mistake.\n\n       C.   All Continuing Fees, Advertising Contributions, amounts due for purchases by you from us and our affiliates, and other amounts which you owe us or our affiliates shall bear interest after due date at the highest applicable legal rate for open account business credit, not to exceed one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month.  You acknowledge that this Paragraph does not constitute agreement by us or our affiliates to accept such payments after same are due or a commitment by us to extend credit to, or otherwise finance your operation of, the Franchised Restaurant.  Further, you acknowledge that your failure to pay all amounts when due shall constitute grounds for termination of this Agreement, as provided in Paragraph XVI hereof, notwithstanding the provisions of this Paragraph.\n\n       D.   Notwithstanding any designation by you, we have the sole discretion to apply any payments by you to any past due indebtedness of yours for Continuing Fees, Advertising Contributions, purchases from us and our affiliates, interest or any other indebtedness.  Further, if you are delinquent in the payment of any fees or indebtedness we have the right to require you to prepay estimated Continuing Fees and Advertising Contributions.\n\nXI.    ACCOUNTING AND RECORDS\n\n       A.   You will maintain during the term of this Agreement, and preserve for the time period specified by us, full, complete, and accurate books, records, and accounts in accordance with the standard accounting\n\n                                          11\n\nsystem prescribed by us from time to time in writing.  You will retain for a period of three (3) years all books and records related to the Franchised Restaurant, including without limitation, sales checks, purchase orders, invoices, payroll records, customer lists, check stubs, sales tax records and returns, cash receipts and disbursement journals and general ledgers.  If a computerized accounting system is developed by us for use throughout the franchise System, you will at your expense implement and utilize such a system according to the standards and procedures established by us.\n\n       B.   You will supply to us on or before the twenty-eighth (28th) day after the end of each fiscal quarter, in the form approved by us, an activity report and a detailed profit and loss statement, balance sheet and statement of cash flow for the last preceding fiscal quarter.  Additionally, you will, at your expense, submit to us within ninety (90) days after the end of each fiscal year during the term of this Agreement, a detailed profit and loss statement and statement of cash flow for such fiscal year and a balance sheet as of the last day of such fiscal year, prepared on an accrual basis including all adjustments necessary for fair presentation of the financial statements.  Such financial statements must be certified to be true and correct by you and be reviewed by an independent certified public account.\n\n       C.   You will submit to us such other periodic reports, forms and records as specified, and in the manner and at the time as specified in the Manuals or as we otherwise require in writing from time to time.\n\n       D.   You will record all sales on electronic cash registers approved by\n\n\n\n\n\nus or on such other types of cash registers as may be designated by us in the Manuals or otherwise in writing.  We reserve the right to designate the information system used in your Franchised Restaurant including the computer hardware, software, other equipment and enhancements.  At such time as we designate the approved information system, you will have one hundred eighty (180) days in which to install and commence using the approved information system.  In connection with the approved information system, you agree to the following:\n\n            1.    You understand that you will be required to acquire the right to use the information system, obtain peripheral equipment and accessories and arrange for required maintenance and support services, all at your cost.\n\n            2.    We shall have the right at all times to access the information system and to retrieve, analyze, download and use all software, data and files stored or used on the information system.  We may access the information system in the Franchised Restaurant or from other locations.  You shall store all data and information on the information system that we designate from time to time.\n\n            3.    All modifications and enhancements made to the approved information system shall be our property (or the appropriate vendor if we so designate), without regard to the source of the modification or enhancement. You agree to execute any documents, in the form provided by us, that we determine are necessary to reflect such ownership.\n\n            4.    Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, you shall allow our employees or agents to remove the required software from the information system, shall immediately return to us the software, each component thereof, any data generated by the use thereof, all documentation for the software and other materials or information that relate to or reveal the software and its operation.  You shall immediately destroy any and all back-up or other copies of the software or parts thereof, and any data generated by the use of the software (other than financial information relating solely to you).\n\n            5.    You acknowledge and agree that there will be fees payable by you in connection with the installation, use, support, maintenance, and periodic enhancements of the approved information system.  These fees will include but are not necessarily limited to an on-site installation and support fee,\n\n                                          12\n\nsoftware support fees and software maintenance fees.  These fees will be payable to us or a vendor designated by us and may be increased from time to time.\n\n            6.    You will be required to execute a software license agreement setting forth in more detail your rights and obligations in connection with your use of the approved information system.\n\nYou agree that we have the right to use your data as part of our earnings claim in our Franchise Offering Circular.\n\n       E.   We or our designated agents have the right at all reasonable times to examine and copy, at our expense, your books, records, and tax returns.  We also have the right, at any time, to have an independent audit made of your books and records at our expense.  If an inspection reveals that any payments due to us have been understated in any report to us, then you will immediately pay to us the amount understated upon demand, in addition to interest from the date such amount was due until paid, at the maximum rate permitted by law not to exceed one and half percent (1.5%) per month.  If an inspection discloses an understatement in any report of two percent (2%) or more, you will also reimburse us for any and all costs and expenses connected with the inspection (including, without limitation, reasonable accounting and attorneys' fees), and we will thereafter have the right to require you to submit annual financial statements, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, audited by an independent certified public accountant.  The foregoing remedies shall be in addition to any other remedies we may have.\n\n       F.   You acknowledge that nothing contained in this Agreement constitutes our agreement to accept any payments after they are due or a commitment by us to extend credit to or otherwise finance your operation of the Franchised Restaurant.  Further, you acknowledge that your failure to pay all amounts when due constitutes a material default of, and grounds for, termination of this Agreement.\n\nXII.   STANDARDS OF QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE\n\n       In order to promote and protect the value of the Marks and the System, and to insure optimum quality control as to products and services provided and sold in Franchised Restaurants, you acknowledge and agree that substantial uniformity must be maintained in the quality, type and standard of Franchised Restaurant, and in their facilities, products, services and operations. Therefore, you will comply with all requirements described in this Agreement, the Manuals and other written policies supplied by us.  Mandatory specifications, standards, operating procedures and rules prescribed from time to time by us in the Manuals or otherwise communicated to you in writing, shall constitute provisions of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein.  All references herein to this Agreement shall include all such mandatory specifications, standards and operating procedures and rules.\n\n       A.   You will commence operation of your Franchised Restaurant within nine (9) months of the execution of this Agreement or as otherwise required or approved in writing by us.  Before opening, you will have procured all necessary licenses, permits, and approvals, including, but not limited to, liquor and construction permits; hired and trained personnel, made all leasehold\n\n\n\n\n\nimprovements, and acquired initial inventory.  At the time of opening you must have a minimum of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) in immediately accessible working capital funds to be used solely to defray the costs of operating the Restaurant for the initial several months.  If for any reason you fail to commence operation within the nine (9) month period, we may terminate this Agreement immediately upon delivery of written notice of termination to you.\n\nB.     You will maintain the condition and appearance of the premises of the Franchised Restaurant consistent with our quality controls and standards.  You will effect reasonable maintenance of the Franchised Restaurant as is from time to time required to maintain or improve the appearance and efficient operation of the Franchised Restaurant, including but not limited to replacement of worn out or obsolete fixtures and signs, repair of the exterior and interior of the premises of the Franchised Restaurant, and purchasing and installation of new or\n\n                                          13\n\nmodified equipment.  If at any time in our judgment the general state of repair or the appearance of the premises of the Franchised Restaurant or its equipment, fixtures, signs or decor does not meet our quality control and standards therefor, we will notify you, specifying the action to be taken by you to correct such deficiency.  If you fail or refuse to initiate a bona fide program to complete any required maintenance, within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, we will have the right, but not the obligation, in addition to all other remedies, to enter upon the premises of the Franchised Restaurant and effect such repairs, painting, maintenance or replacements of equipment, fixtures or signs on your behalf and you shall pay the entire costs thereof on demand.\n\n       C.   You will not make any material alterations to the premises of the Franchised Restaurant make any material replacements of or alterations to the equipment, fixtures or signs of the Franchised Restaurant without our prior written approval.\n\n       D.   The Franchised Restaurant may be used solely for the purpose of conducting a Buffalo Wild Wings Franchised Restaurant.  The operating entity (corporation, partnership or limited liability company) will be dedicated solely to the operation of your Franchised Restaurant(s) and will not hold any interest in, operate or manage any other business of any kind without our prior written approval.\n\n       E.   We have developed and own proprietary sauces for use in preparing chicken wings, the weck kaiser roll and other menu items and specially prepared pocket pizza mix and \"Buffalo Breath Chili\" mix (\"Trade Secret Food Products\"). In order to protect our trade secrets and to monitor the manufacture, packaging, processing and sale of Trade Secret Food Products, we will (i) manufacture, supply, and sell Trade Secret Food Products to our franchisees; (ii) disclose the formulae for and methods for preparation of the Trade Secret Food Products to a limited number of suppliers who may be authorized by us to manufacture Trade Secret Food Products to our precise specifications and sell Trade Secret Food Products to our franchisees; and/or (iii) disclose the formulae for and methods for preparation of the pocket pizza mix and the Buffalo Breath Chili mix to you who will be authorized by us to manufacture them to our precise specifications for sale only at the location of the Franchised Restaurant specified herein, unless otherwise approved by us.  Under no circumstances will we disclose the formulae for and methods of preparation of any of our proprietary sauces to you.  You acknowledge that you may be required to purchase Trade Secret Food Products (and other products whose consistency and quality is key to the success of the System) from us or a limited number of suppliers so authorized by us and will be required to use Trade Secret Food Products as designated by us.\n\n       F.   You will offer for sale and sell at the Franchised Restaurant all Menu Items, other food and beverage products and other products that we from time to time require and shall not offer for sale or sell at the Franchised Restaurant or the premises which you occupy any unapproved products or menu items or use such premises for any purpose other than the operation of a Franchised Restaurant in full compliance with this Agreement.  You will offer all Menu Items on a menu specified by us.\n\n       G.

You will, in the event you continue to operate or subsequently begin to operate any other business, not use any reproduction, counterfeit, copy or colorable imitation of the Marks either in connection with such other business or the promotion thereof, which is likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception, or which is likely to dilute our exclusive rights in and to the Marks\n\n\n\n\n\nand will not utilize any designation of origin or description or representation which falsely suggests or represents an association or connection with us so as to constitute unfair competition.  You will make such modifications or alterations to the premises of the Franchised Restaurant (including, without limitation, the changing of the telephone number) immediately upon termination or expiration of this Agreement as may be necessary to prevent any association between us or the System and any business thereon subsequently operated by you or others, and will make such specific additional changes thereto as we may reasonably request for that purpose, including, without limitation, removal of all distinctive physical and structural features identifying the System.  In the event you fail or refuse to comply with the requirements of this Paragraph XVII, we have the right to enter upon the premises where your Franchised Restaurant was conducted, without being guilty of trespass or any other tort, for the purpose of making or causing to be made such changes as may be required at your expense, which expense you will pay upon demand.\n\n       F.   You will promptly pay all sums owing to us and our affiliates.  In the event of termination for any default, such sums will include all damages, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by us as a result of the default.\n\n       G.   You will pay to us all damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by us in obtaining injunctive or other relief for the enforcement of any provisions of this Agreement.\n\n       H.

We will have the right, title and interest to any sign or sign faces bearing the Marks.  You hereby acknowledge our right to access the premises of the Franchised Restaurant if we elect to take possession of any sign or sign faces bearing the Marks.\n\n       J.   You hereby acknowledge that all telephone numbers used in the operation of the Franchised Restaurant constitute assets of the Franchised Restaurant; and upon termination or expiration of this Agreement  you will assign to us or our designee, all right, title, and interest in and to your telephone numbers and will notify the telephone company and all listing agencies of the termination or expiration of your right to use any telephone number and any regular, classified or other telephone directory listing associated with the Marks and to authorize a transfer of same to or at our direction.\n\n       K.   We will have the right (but not the duty), to be exercised by notice of intent to do so within sixty (60) days after termination or expiration, to purchase for cash any or all assets of the Franchised Restaurant, including leasehold improvements, equipment, supplies, and other inventory, advertising materials, and all items bearing the Marks, at your cost or fair market value, whichever is less.  You acknowledge that, pursuant to Paragraph XVII.I. of this Agreement, all signs and sign faces bearing the Marks are specifically excluded from this provision as such signs and sign faces are deemed to be our property. If the parties cannot agree on fair market value within a reasonable time, the determination of fair market value shall be determined by an appraiser selected by us and you.  If you and we cannot agree on a single appraiser, each party shall select one appraiser, who together will select a third appraiser and the fair market value will be the average of the three (3) independent appraisers. Each party will pay their own appraiser and the cost of the third appraiser will be shared equally by the parties.  If we elect to exercise any option to purchase as herein provided, we have the right to set off all amounts due from you under this Agreement, if any, against any payment therefor.\n\n       L.   You will comply with the covenants contained in Paragraph XV of this Agreement.\n\nXVIII. TRANSFERABILITY OF INTEREST\n\n       A.   This Agreement and all rights hereunder can be assigned and transferred by us and, if so, shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of our successors and assigns.\n\n       B.   This Agreement, and your rights and obligations under it, are and shall remain personal to you.  The term \"Transfer\" shall mean any sale, assignment, gift, pledge, mortgage or any other encumbrance, transfer by bankruptcy, transfer by judicial order, merger, consolidation, share exchange, transfer by operation of law or otherwise, whether direct or indirect, voluntary or involuntary, of this Agreement or any interest in it, or any rights or obligations arising under it, or of any material portion of your assets, or of any interest in you.  You (and your shareholders, partners and members) will not directly or indirectly make a Transfer without our prior written consent.  We will not withhold our consent to a Transfer, subject to all of the following conditions being satisfied:\n\n            1.    You are in full compliance with this Agreement, you have no uncured defaults, all your fees, debts and financial obligations to us, our affiliates and the Fund are current, and you are current in your required local advertising expenditures;\n\n            2.    You execute a written agreement in a form satisfactory to us in which you and your owners covenant to observe all applicable post-term obligations and covenants contained in this Agreement;\n\n\n\n\n\n            3.    The proposed transferee enters into a written agreement in a form satisfactory to us assuming and agreeing to discharge all of your obligations and covenants under this Agreement for the remainder of its term or, at our option, execute our then-current standard form of franchise agreement (which\n\n                                          24\n\nmay provide for different fees, advertising requirements, duration, and other rights and obligations from those provided in this Agreement);\n\n            4.    The proposed transferee agrees in writing to perform such maintenance, remodeling and re-equipping of the Restaurant that we determine necessary to bring the Restaurant in compliance with our then-current standards;\n\n            5.    Prior to the date of the proposed Transfer, the proposed transferee's management team successfully completes such training and instruction as we deem necessary;\n\n            6.    We are satisfied that the proposed transferee (and if the proposed transferee is an entity, all holders of any interest in such entity) meets all of the requirements for our new franchisees applicable on the date we receive notice of the proposed transfer and including, but not limited to, good reputation and character, business experience, restaurant management experience, and financial strength and liquidity;\n\n            7.    You and all holders of an interest in you execute a general release, in the form prescribed by us, releasing, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all claims that you or any of your investors may have against us and our affiliates, including our and their respective shareholders, officers, directors and employees, in both their individual and corporate capacities;\n\n            8.    You pay us a transfer fee equal to one-half (1/2) of the then-current Initial Franchise Fee; and\n\n            9.    We waive our right of first refusal under Paragraph XX.\n\n       C.   Application for our consent to a transfer and tender of the right of first refusal provided for in Paragraph XX, will be accompanied by the documents (including a copy of the proposed purchase or other transfer agreement) or other information required by us.  Any agreement used in connection with a transfer including a lease or management agreement, shall be subject to our prior written approval.\n\n       D.   In the event you are a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity, any transfer of stock (or other form of ownership interest) constituting a controlling interest in you will be subject to the consent, right of first refusal, transfer fee and all other applicable provisions of this Agreement.  For purposes of this Paragraph XVIII, any change in the percentage you owned, directly or indirectly, by any person or entity who directly or indirectly owns an interest in you (including any addition or deletion of any such person or entity) which results in a change in forty-nine percent (49%) or more of your ownership or any series of changes in the percentage you owned, directly or indirectly, by any such person or entity (including any addition or deletion of any such person or entity) which results within a period of three (3) years in any change in forty-nine percent (49%) or more of your ownership shall be deemed a transfer of a controlling interest in you.  Any individual transfer of an interest less than a controlling interest in you or the Franchised Restaurant must have our prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld, but will not be subject to our right of first refusal or the payment of the transfer fee.  You will however, reimburse us for its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in approving the transfers including our attorneys' fees.  Any person who acquires any interest in you, this Agreement or the Franchised Restaurant must execute the Owner Agreement attached as EXHIBIT A to this Agreement.\n\n       E.   You will not, without our prior written consent, place in, on or upon the location of the Franchised Restaurant, or in any communication media, any form of advertising, or list with any business, real estate broker, agent, or attorney any information relating to the sale of the Franchised Restaurant or the rights granted hereunder.\n\n                                          25\n\nXIX.

In the event of your death or incapacity, or the death or incapacity of any partner, any shareholder owning fifty percent (50%) or more of your capital stock, or any Member who owns a majority interest in a limited liability company, the heirs, beneficiaries, devisees, or legal representatives of said individual, partner or shareholders shall, within one hundred eighty (180) days of such event:\n\n            1.    Apply to us for the right to continue to operate the franchise for the duration of the term of this Agreement and any renewals hereof, which right shall be granted upon the fulfillment of all of the conditions set forth in Paragraph XVIII. of this Agreement (except that no transfer fee shall be required); or\n\n            2.    Sell, assign, transfer, or convey your interest in compliance with the provisions of Paragraphs XVIII and XX of this Agreement; provided,\n\n\n\n\n\nhowever, in the event a proper and timely application for the right to continue to operate has been made and rejected, the one hundred eighty (180) days to sell, assign, transfer or convey shall be computed from the date of said rejection.  For purposes of this Paragraph, our silence on an application made pursuant to Paragraph XIX.A.1. through the one hundred and eighty (180) days following the event of death or incapacity shall be deemed a rejection made on the last day of such period.\n\n       B.   In the event of the death or incapacity of an individual franchisee, or any partner or shareholder of you which is a partnership or corporation, where the aforesaid provisions of Paragraph XVIII have not been fulfilled within the time provided, all rights licensed to you under this Agreement shall, at our option, terminate forthwith and we will have the option to purchase the assets of the Franchised Restaurant in accordance with Paragraph XVII.K. herein.\n\nXX.    RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL\n\n       If you or your owners propose to sell the Franchised Restaurant (or its assets) or a controlling interest in the ownership of you as defined in Paragraph XVIII, you or your owners will obtain and deliver a bona fide, executed written offer to purchase same to us, which shall, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of delivery of such offer to us, have the right, exercisable by written notice to you or your owners, to purchase the Franchised Restaurant, (its assets) or an ownership interest in you for the price and on the terms and conditions contained in such offer, provided that we may substitute cash for any form of payment proposed in such offer.  If we do not exercise this right of first refusal, you may accept the offer, subject to our prior written approval, as provided in Paragraph XVIII hereof, provided that if such offer is not so accepted within six (6) months of the date thereof, we will again have the right of first refusal herein described.\n\nXXI.   OPERATION IN THE EVENT OF ABSENCE, DISABILITY OR DEATH\n\n       In order to prevent any interruption of the Franchised Restaurant which would cause harm to the Franchised Restaurant and thereby depreciate the value thereof, you authorize us, in the event that you are absent or incapacitated by reason of illness or death and are not, therefore, in our sole judgment, able to operate the Franchised Restaurant, to operate the Franchised Restaurant for so long as we deem necessary and practical, and without waiver of any other rights or remedies we may have under this Agreement.  Provided, however, that we shall not be obligated to so operate the Franchised Restaurant.  All monies from the operation of the business during such period of operation by us shall be kept in a separate account and the expenses of the Franchised Restaurant, including reasonable compensation and expenses for our representative, shall be charged to said account.  If, as herein provided, we temporarily operate for you the Franchised Restaurant, you will indemnify and hold us harmless and any representative of ours who may act hereunder, from any and all claims arising from\n\n                                          26\n\nthe operation of the Franchised Restaurant, including, without limitation, our acts and omissions and acts and omissions of our representatives.\n\nXXII.

You cannot represent to third parties that you are our agent and it is understood between the parties that you will be an independent contractor who is in no way authorized to make any contract, agreement, warranty or representation on our behalf, or to create any obligation, express or implied, on our behalf.  As an independent entrepreneur, you are solely responsible for the control,  management and day-to-day operation of the Franchised Restaurant, including but not limited to, such matters as determining the prices at which you will offer and sell approved products and services, hiring and discharging your employees and setting and paying wages and benefits of your employees and that we will have no power, responsibility or liability with respect to such pricing, hiring, discharging, setting and paying of wages or related matters.  All standards of quality and performance, including those listed in Paragraph XII, are established to promote and protect the value of the Marks and the System and to insure optimum quality control as to products and services.  You alone are responsible for the food production and preparation at the Franchised Restaurant.\n\n       B.   You will prominently display, by posting of a sign within public view, on or in the premises of the Franchised Restaurant, a statement that clearly indicates that the Franchised Restaurant is independently owned and operated by you as a franchisee and not as an agent.\n\n       C.   You agree to indemnify, defend and hold us and our affiliates harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, damages and liabilities, however caused, arising directly or indirectly from, as a result of, or in connection with, the use and operation of the Franchised Restaurant, as well as the costs, including attorneys' fees, of defending against them (hereinafter are \"Franchise Claims\").  Franchise Claims include, but are not limited to, those arising from any death, personal injury or property damage (whether caused wholly or in part through our active or passive negligence), latent, or other defects in the Franchised Restaurant, or your employment practices.  In the event a Franchise Claim is made against us, we reserve the right in our sole discretion to select our own legal counsel to represent our interests and you will reimburse us for our attorneys' fees immediately upon our request as they are incurred.\n\n\n\n\n\nXXIII. MISCELLANEOUS\n\n       A.   Our failure to exercise any power reserved to us hereunder, or to insist upon strict compliance by you with any obligation or condition hereunder, and any custom or practice of the parties in variance with the terms hereof, shall not constitute a waiver of our right to demand exact compliance with the terms hereof.  Our waiver of any default by you shall not be binding unless in writing and executed by us and shall not affect or impair our right with respect to any subsequent default of the same or of a different nature.\n\n       B.   Any and all notices required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be personally delivered, mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, or sent overnight courier to the respective parties at the following addresses unless and until a different address has been designated by written notice to the other party:\n\nNotices to Us:    bw-3 FRANCHISE SYSTEMS, INC.                   1919 Interchange Tower                   600 South Highway 169                   Minneapolis, Minnesota 55426\n\n                                          27\n\nCopy to           Mary Beth Brody, Esq.

Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor shall be deemed, to confer upon any person or legal entity other than you and us and such of their respective successors and assigns as may be contemplated by this Agreement, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.\n\nXXIV.

NO RIGHT OR REMEDY CONFERRED UPON OR RESERVED TO US OR YOU BY THIS AGREEMENT IS INTENDED TO BE, NOR SHALL BE DEEMED, EXCLUSIVE OF ANY OTHER RIGHT OR REMEDY HEREIN OR BY LAW OR EQUITY PROVIDED OR PERMITTED, BUT EACH SHALL BE CUMULATIVE OF EVERY OTHER RIGHT OR REMEDY.\n\n       D.   NOTHING HEREIN CONTAINED SHALL BAR OUR RIGHT TO OBTAIN INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AGAINST THREATENED CONDUCT THAT WILL CAUSE US LOSS OR DAMAGES, UNDER THE USUAL EQUITY RULES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABLE RULES FOR OBTAINING RESTRAINING ORDERS AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIONS.\n\nXXV.   DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n       A.   The parties have entered into this Agreement in good faith and in the belief that it is mutually advantageous to them.  It is with that same spirit of cooperation that they pledge to attempt to resolve any dispute amicably without the necessity of litigation.  Accordingly, they agree that except as set forth below, if any dispute arises between them relating to this Agreement that prior to the commencement of any legal action to interpret or enforce this Agreement, they will first use the procedures specified in this Section.\n\n       B.   The party seeking to initiate the procedure shall give written notice to the other party, describing in general terms the nature of the dispute, the claim for relief and identifying one or more individuals with authority to settle the dispute on such party's behalf.  The party receiving such notice shall have ten (10) business days within which to designate by written notice one or more individuals with authority to settle the dispute on such party's behalf.\n\n       C.   The authorized individuals shall be entitled to make such investigation of the dispute as they deem appropriate, but agree to meet promptly, and in no event later than thirty (30) days from the date of the initial written notice, to discuss resolution of the dispute.  The authorized individuals shall meet at such times and places and with such frequency as they may agree.  If the dispute has not been resolved within thirty (30) days from the date of their initial meeting, the parties shall cease direct negotiations and shall submit the dispute to mediation in accordance with the following procedure.\n\n       D.   The authorized individuals shall have five (5) business days from the date they cease direct negotiations to submit to each other a written list of acceptable qualified mediators not affiliated with any of the parties. Within five (5) days from the date of receipt of such list, the authorized individuals shall rank the mediators in numerical order of preference and exchange such rankings.  If one or more names are on both lists, the highest ranking person shall be designated as the mediator.  If no mediator has been selected under this procedure, the parties agree jointly to request the local administrative judge of the County in which our corporate headquarters are situated to supply within ten (10) business days a list of potential qualified mediators.  Within five (5) business days of receipt of the list, the parties shall again rank the proposed mediators in numerical order of preference and shall simultaneously exchange such lists and shall select as the mediator the individual\n\n                                          29\n\nreceiving the highest combined ranking.  If such mediator is not available to serve, they shall proceed to contact the mediator who was next highest in ranking until they are able to select a mediator.\n\n       E.   In consultation with the mediator selected, the parties shall promptly designate a mutually convenient time and place for the mediation, and unless circumstances require otherwise, such time is to be not later than forty-five (45) days after selection of the mediator.  In the event any party to this Agreement has substantial need for information in the possession of another party to this Agreement in order to prepare for the mediation, all parties shall attempt in good faith to agree on procedures for the expeditious exchange of such information, with the help of the mediator if required.  At least seven (7) days prior to the first scheduled session of the mediation, each party shall deliver to the mediator and to the other party a concise written summary of its views on the matter in dispute, and such other matters required by the mediator. The mediator may also request that a confidential issue paper be submitted to him by each party.\n\n       F.   In the mediation, each party shall be represented by an authorized individual and may be represented by counsel.  In addition, each party may, with permission of the mediator, bring such additional persons as are needed to respond to questions, contribute information and participate in the negotiations.\n\n       G.   The mediator shall determine the format for the meetings, designed to assure that both the mediator and the authorized individuals have an opportunity to hear an oral presentation of each party's views on the matter in dispute, and that the authorized parties attempt to negotiate a resolution of the matter in dispute, with or without the assistance of counsel or others, but with the assistance of the mediator.  To this end, the mediator is authorized to conduct both joint meetings and separate private caucuses with the parties.  The mediation session shall be private.  The mediator will keep confidential all information learned in private caucus with any party unless specifically\n\n\n\n\n\nauthorized by such party to make disclosure of the information to the other party.  The parties agree to sign a document agreeing that the mediator shall be governed by the provisions of the local Rules of Civil Procedure and such other rules as the mediator shall prescribe.  The parties commit to participate in the proceedings in good faith with the intention of resolving the dispute, if at all possible.\n\n       H.   The parties agree to participate in the mediation procedure to its conclusion.  The mediation shall be terminated (i) by the execution of a settlement agreement by the parties, (ii) by a declaration of the mediator that the mediation is terminated, or (iii) by a written declaration of a party to the effect that the mediation process is terminated at the conclusion of one full day's mediation session.  Even if the mediation is terminated without a resolution of the dispute, the parties agree not to terminate negotiations and not to commence any legal action or seek other remedies prior to the expiration of five (5) days following the mediation.  The fees and expenses of the mediator shall be shared equally by the parties.  The mediator shall be disqualified as a witness, consultant, expert or counsel for any party with respect to the dispute and any related matters.\n\n       I.   Mediation is a compromise negotiation for purposes of the Federal and State Rules of Evidence and constitutes privileged communication.  The entire mediation process is confidential, and no stenographic, visual or audio record shall be made.  All conduct, statements, promises, offers, views and opinions, whether oral or written, made in the course of the mediation by any party, by their agents, employees, representatives or other invitees and by the mediator are confidential and shall, in addition and where appropriate, be deemed to be privileged.  Such conduct, statements, promises, offers, views and opinions shall not be discoverable or admissible for any purposes, including impeachment, in any litigation or other proceeding involving the parties, and shall not be disclosed to anyone not an agent, employee, expert, witness, or representative of any of the parties;  provided however, that evidence otherwise discoverable or admissible is not excluded from discovery or admission as a result of its use in the mediation.\n\n                                          30\n\n       J.   Nothing herein contained shall bar our right to seek and obtain temporary injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law against any conduct or threatened conduct by you which could impair the goodwill associated with the Marks.\n\n       K.   The parties (and their respective owners) agree to waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the right to or claim for any punitive or exemplary damages against the other and agree that in the event of a dispute between them, each will be limited to the recovery of actual damages sustained.\n\nXXVI.

APPROPRIATION AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION.  Except as permitted under the Agreements, you will not at any time use, copy or duplicate the System or any aspect thereof, or any of our trade secrets, recipes, methods of operation, processes, formulas, advertising, marketing, designs, plans, software, programs, know-how or other proprietary ideas or information, nor will you convey, divulge, make available or communicate such information to any third party or assist others in using, copying or duplicating any of the foregoing.\n\n            D.    INFRINGEMENT; VALIDITY OF MARKS AND COPYRIGHTS; REGISTRATIONS. You will not at any time commit any act that would infringe upon or impair the value of the System or the Marks, nor will you engage in any business or market any product or service under a name, mark, or design that is confusingly or deceptively similar to any of the Marks.

The covenants and agreements contained in this Section 2 shall be construed as separate covenants and agreements, and if any court shall finally determine that the restraints provided for in any such covenants and agreements are too broad as to the area, activity or time covered, said area, activity or time covered may be reduced to whatever extent the court deems reasonable, and such covenants and agreements shall be enforced as to such reduced area, activity or time.  To the extent required by the laws of the state in which the Restaurant is located, the duration or the geographic areas included within the foregoing covenants, or both, shall be deemed amended in accordance with Section 2.\n\n                                          34\n\n       3.   GUARANTY.\n\n            A.    GUARANTY.  Each of you personally and unconditionally guaranty to us and to our parent and other affiliates, as well as any of their successors or assigns, the punctual payment when due of all sums, indebtedness and liabilities of every kind and nature that Franchisee may now or in the future owe to any of us (including interest, and all attorneys' fees, costs and expenses incurred by any of us in collection).\n\n\n\n\n\n            B.    COVENANTS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.  Each of you covenant and agree that: (1) liability under this guaranty shall be joint and several; (2) that this is a guaranty of payment and not of collection and you shall render any payment required under the Agreements or this guaranty upon demand; (3) this guaranty shall extend to all amounts you may now or in the future owe to any of us, whether pursuant to the Agreements, another agreement with us or otherwise; (4) your liability under this guaranty shall not be contingent or conditioned upon pursuit by us of any remedies against Franchisee or any of you; (5) your liability hereunder shall not be diminished, relieved, or otherwise affected by any extension of time, credit, or other indulgence or waiver that we may from time to time grant to Franchisee or to any of you, including, without limitation, the acceptance of partial payment or performance, the compromise or release of any claims, the release of any other guarantor, or our consent to any transfer or assignment of the franchise or any interest therein and expressly reserve all rights that we may have against you.\n\n            C.    TERM OF GUARANTY.  This guaranty and your obligations under it shall continue in effect so long as you operate any Buffalo Wild Wing Restaurant or hold any beneficial interest therein and for a one (1) year period thereafter.  Further, this guaranty shall be extended during any period in which (1) any of us is involved in any judicial or administrative process with Franchisee or any of you (i) to collect any amounts owed us by you, or (ii) to enforce the terms of this guaranty, or (2) any bankruptcy or similar proceeding involving Franchisee or any of you.  Your obligations under this guaranty shall remain in full force and effect without regard to, and shall not be released, discharged or in any way modified or affected by, any circumstance or condition of Franchisee (whether or not you shall have any knowledge or notice thereof), including, without limitation, bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, composition, liquidation or similar proceeding or any action taken by any trustee or receiver or by any court in any such proceeding.\n\n            D.    WAIVERS.  Each of you waives notice of demand, notice of protest, nonpayment or default, and all other notices to which Franchisee or you may be entitled, and all suretyship and guarantor's defenses generally and any and all other notices and legal or equitable defenses to which you may be entitled.  You waive all exemptions to which you may now or hereafter be entitled under the laws of this or any other state or of the United States.  You waive any right that you may have to require that an action be brought against Franchisee or any other payments and claims for reimbursement or subrogation that you may have against Franchisee arising as a result of your execution and performance of this guaranty.\n\n            E.    ASSIGNMENT.  This guaranty is personal to you and the obligations and duties imposed in it may not be delegated or assigned; provided, this guaranty shall be binding upon your successors, assigns, estates and personal representatives.  This guaranty shall inure to our benefit, and the benefit of our affiliates, successors and assigns.\n\n            F.    ENFORCEMENT.  If any one or more provisions in this guaranty shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof and this guaranty shall be construed to bind you to the maximum extent permitted by law that is subsumed within the terms of such provision as though it were separately articulated herein.\n\n                                          35\n\n       4.   COVENANT NOT TO TRANSFER INTERESTS.  The Agreements, and your rights and obligations under them, are and shall remain personal to you.  Any proposed transfer by you (regardless of the form of transfer) shall be subject to the same terms and conditions contained in the Franchise Agreement.

Each of you agree and covenant that you will not at any time during which Franchisee is a Buffalo Wild Wings/bw-3 franchisee and/or developer, directly or indirectly, voluntarily or involuntarily, make any Transfer, unless you first obtain our written approval in compliance with the same provisions applicable to a transfer by you as set forth in the Agreements. You shall cause all stock certificates (or other documents evidencing an interest or right to acquire an interest) issued by Franchisee to bear a legend indicating that such stock (or other documents) is subject to the restrictions provided for in the applicable Agreement.\n\n       5.   MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n            A.    CAPITALIZED TERMS.  For purposes of this Agreement, all capitalized terms shall have the same meaning as those terms are defined in the Franchise Agreement.\n\n            B.    DISPUTES.  Disputes under this Agreement shall be resolved in the same manner as provided under the Franchise Agreement.  You expressly acknowledge that the provisions of the Franchise Agreement pertaining to mediation, venue, applicable law, time periods and limitations govern any disputes between us and you.\n\n       IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of you have signed this Agreement on the date set forth opposite your signature.\n\nSignature:                                      Date:           --------------------------                 -------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nName:      ------------------------------- Address:         ----------------------------\n\n- ------------------------------------\n\n- ------------------------------------ Percentage Interest:                     ----------\n\nSignature:                                      Date:           --------------------------                 ------------------- Name:      ------------------------------- Address:         ----------------------------\n\n- ------------------------------------\n\n- ------------------------------------ Percentage Interest:                     ----------\n\nSignature:                                      Date:           --------------------------                 ------------------- Name:      ------------------------------- Address:         ----------------------------\n\n- ------------------------------------\n\n- ------------------------------------ Percentage Interest:                     ---------- Signature:                                      Date:           --------------------------                 -------------------\n\n                                          36\n\nName:      ------------------------------- Address:         ----------------------------\n\n- ------------------------------------\n\n- ------------------------------------ Percentage Interest:                     ----------\n\nSignature:                                      Date:           --------------------------                 ------------------- Name:      ------------------------------- Address:         ----------------------------\n\n- ------------------------------------\n\n- ------------------------------------ Percentage Interest:                     ----------\n\nTO BE COMPLETED IF MANAGER IS NOT AN OWNER.\n\nI represent and acknowledge that I am the Manager of a Restaurant and that I agree to be bound by the provisions of Section 2 of this Agreement.\n\nMANAGER\n\nSignature:                                      Date:           --------------------------                 ------------------- Name:      ------------------------------- Address:         ----------------------------\n\n- ------------------------------------\n\n- ------------------------------------\n\n                                          37\n\n                                     EXHIBIT B\n\n\n\n\n\n                           DESCRIPTION OF DESIGNATED AREA\n\nFRANCHISOR:                               FRANCHISEE:\n\nBW-3 FRANCHISE SYSTEMS, INC.                                           ------------------------------------\n\nBy                                        By   ----------------------------------        ----------------------------------\n\n   Its                                       Its        -----------------------------            ------------------------------\n\n                                          By                                             ----------------------------------\n\n                                             Its                                                 ------------------------------\n\n                                          38\n\n                                     EXHIBIT C                                  ADDENDUM TO LEASE\n\n       THIS ADDENDUM TO LEASE, dated ______________, 199__, is entered into by and between _______________________(\"Lessor\"), and __________________________ (\"Lessee\").\n\n       RECITALS:\n\n       A.   The parties hereto have entered into a certain Lease Agreement, dated _____________, 199__, and pertaining to the premises located at _________ __________________________________ (the \"Lease\").\n\n       B.   Lessor acknowledges that Lessee intends to operate a Restaurant from the leased premises (the \"Premises\") pursuant to a Franchise Agreement (the \"Franchise Agreement\") with bw-3 Franchise Systems, Inc. (\"bw-3\") under the name \"Buffalo Wild Wings\" or other name designated by bw-3 (\"Franchised Restaurant\").\n\n       C.   The parties now desire to amend the Lease in accordance with the terms and conditions contained herein.\n\n       AGREEMENT:\n\n       NOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby mutually covenanted and agreed between Lessor and Lessee as follows:\n\n       1.   REMODELING AND DECOR.  Lessor agrees that Lessee shall have the right to remodel, equip, paint and decorate the interior of the Premises and to display such proprietary marks and signs on the interior and exterior of the Premises as Lessee is reasonably required to do pursuant to the Franchise Agreement and any successor Franchise Agreement under which Lessee may operate a Franchised Restaurant on the Premises.\n\n       2.   ASSIGNMENT.  Lessee shall have the right to assign all of its right, title and interest in the Lease to bw-3 or any affiliate of bw-3 at any time during the term of the Lease, including any extensions or renewals thereof, without first obtaining Lessor's consent.  However, no assignment shall be effective until such time as bw-3 or its designated affiliate gives Lessor written notice of its acceptance of such assignment, and nothing contained herein or in any other document shall constitute bw-3 or its designated affiliate a party to the Lease, or  guarantor thereof, and shall not create any liability or obligation of bw-3 or any affiliate of bw-3 unless and until the Lease is assigned to, and accepted in writing by, bw-3 or its designated affiliate.  In the event of an assignment, Lessee shall remain liable under the terms of the Lease.\n\n       3.   DEFAULT AND NOTICE.\n\n            (a)   In the event there is a default or violation by Lessee under        the terms of the Lease, Lessor shall give Lessee and bw-3 written notice        of such default or violation within a reasonable time after Lessor        receives knowledge of its occurrence.  bw-3 will notify Lessor whether it        intends to cure the default and take an automatic assignment of Lessee's        interest as provided in Paragraph 4(a).  bw-3 will have an additional        fifteen (15) days in which to cure the default or violation.\n\n            (b)   All notices to bw-3 shall be sent by registered or certified        mail, postage prepaid, to the following address:\n\n                  bw-3 Franchise Systems, Inc.                   1919 Interchange Tower                   600 South Highway 169                   Minneapolis, MN 55426\n\n\n\n\n\n                                          39\n\n                  Attention: Chief Financial Officer bw-3 may change its address for receiving notices by giving Lessor written notice of such new address.  Lessor agrees that it will notify both Lessee and bw-3 of any change in Lessor's mailing address to which notices should be sent.\n\n       4.   TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION.\n\n            (a)   Upon the expiration or termination of either the Lease or the        Franchise Agreement, bw-3 will, at its option, have the right (but not        the requirement) to take an automatic assignment of Lessee's interest.\n\n            (b)   Upon the expiration or termination of either the Lease or the        Franchise Agreement, Landlord will cooperate with and assist us in        gaining possession of premises and if bw-3 does not elect to take an        assignment of the Lessee's interest, Lessor will allow bw-3 to enter the        Premises, without being guilty of trespass and without incurring any        liability to Lessor, to remove all signs, awnings, and all other items        identifying the Premises as a Franchised Restaurant and to make such        other modifications (such as repainting) as are reasonably necessary to        protect the bw-3 marks and system, and to distinguish the Premises from        Franchised Restaurants.  In the event bw-3 exercises its option to        purchase assets of Lessee, Lessor shall permit bw-3 to remove all such        assets being purchased by bw-3.\n\n       5.   CONSIDERATION; NO LIABILITY.\n\n            (a)   Lessor hereby acknowledges that the provisions of this        Addendum to Lease are required pursuant to the Franchise Agreement under        which Lessee plans to operate its business and the Lessee would not lease        the Premises without this Addendum.\n\n            (b)   Lessor further acknowledges that Lessee is not an agent or        employee of bw-3 and the Lessee has no authority or power to act for, or        to create any liability on behalf of, or to in any way bind bw-3 or any        affiliate of bw-3, and that Lessor has entered into this Addendum to        Lease with full understanding that it creates no duties, obligations or        liabilities of or against bw-3 or any affiliate of bw-3.\n\n       6.   SALES REPORTS.  If requested by bw-3, Lessor will provide bw-3 with whatever information Lessor has regarding Lessee's sales from the Restaurant.\n\n       7.   AMENDMENTS.  No amendment or variation of the terms of this Addendum to the Lease shall be valid unless made in writing and signed by the parties hereto.\n\n       8.   REAFFIRMATION OF LEASE.

In addition to the requirements of Article III and Article VII herein, with respect to the Services provided by RGHI and its Affiliates providing Services hereunder, certain of the Services may involve processes that directly or indirectly support financial information that the Company includes within its consolidated financial reports. The Company has an obligation to ensure that it has internal controls over financial reporting that comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and must also ensure that its external auditors can complete their necessary evaluation of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with auditing standards issued by the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.

RGHI and such Affiliates will perform the agreed key controls and evidence such performance in the agreed format.

Company shall pay or reimburse all of RGHI's expenses and costs arising from such audit. The performance of the agreed key controls, preparation of documentation, providing access to the Company or its delegate and the Company's auditors will be billed at the agreed rates as set forth on Exhibit A.\n\nSource: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1/A, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE III SERVICE LEVELS; SERVICE COORDINATORS; TSA COMMITTEE\n\nSection 3.1 Quality of Services.\n\n(a) Provider shall perform the Services (i) at a level of quality substantially similar in all material respects to that at which such Services were performed or enjoyed during the twelve (12) month period prior to the date hereof and (ii) in accordance with applicable Law (collectively, (i) and (ii), the \"Service Standard\").

If a Change is required by applicable Law or is in response to a threatened Security Incident, Provider may make any and all changes to the Service necessary to comply with applicable Law and any changes thereto or to respond to such threatened Security Incident in a manner consistent with responses made by Provider on its own behalf or in respect of their Affiliates; provided that Provider shall provide Recipient such reasonable advance written notice of the implementation of any such Change as may be practicable under the circumstances; and (ii) with reasonable advance written notice to Recipient, temporarily suspend the provision of a Service as necessary to conduct Systems maintenance or patching without such suspension constituting a breach of the Service Standard.\n\nSource: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1/A, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) A Provider need not provide any Service if it is not permitted to do so by applicable Law. To the extent that any Service is not permitted pursuant to applicable Law, the Parties will cooperate in good faith to enter into arrangements reasonably acceptable to each of the Parties under which the Recipient would obtain the benefit of such Service to the same extent (or as nearly as practicable) as if such Service were permitted by applicable Law.\n\nSection 3.2 Policies. Each Party shall, and shall cause any of its Affiliates or third parties providing or receiving Services (as the case may be) to, follow the reasonable policies, procedures and practices of the other Party and its Affiliates applicable to the Services that are known or made known to such Party. A failure of a Recipient to act in accordance with this Section 3.2 that prevents a Provider from providing a Service hereunder shall, upon reasonable advance written notice to the Recipient (where practicable), relieves Provider of its obligations under the Service until such time as the failure has been cured.\n\nSection 3.3 Service Coordinators and Dispute Resolution.\n\n(a) RGHI and Company shall each nominate a representative to act as the primary contact person with respect to the performance of the Services (each, a \"Service Coordinator\"). Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Parties, the Parties shall direct all initial communications relating to this Agreement and the Services to the Service Coordinators. The initial Service Coordinators for RGHI and Company, including their contact information, are set forth on Exhibit C. Either Party may replace its Service Coordinator at any time by providing notice and contact information for the newly designated Service Coordinator in accordance with Section 10.5. The Service Coordinators shall oversee the implementation and ongoing operation of this Agreement. The Parties shall ensure that their respective Service Coordinators shall meet in person or telephonically at such times as are reasonably requested by RGHI or Company to review and discuss the status of, and any issues arising in connection with, the Services or this Agreement.\n\n(b) In the event a dispute arises between the Parties under this Agreement, telephonic negotiations shall be conducted between the Parties' respective Service Coordinators within ten (10) days following a written request from any Party (\"Dispute Negotiations\"). If the Service Coordinators are unable to resolve the dispute within ten (10) days after the Parties have commenced Dispute Negotiations, then either RGHI or the Company, by written request to the other Party, may request that such dispute be referred for resolution to the respective presidents (or similar position) of the divisions implicated by the matter for the Parties, or more senior executive of a Party if such Party so designates, which presidents (or other executives) will have fifteen (15) days to resolve such dispute. If the presidents of the relevant divisions (or other executives) for each Party do not agree to a resolution of such dispute within fifteen (15) days after the reference of the matter to them, or if the dispute is not otherwise resolved in a friendly manner as set forth in this Section 3.3, then any unresolved dispute may be resolved pursuant to Section 10.8.\n\nSource: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1/A, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 3.4 Limitation of Services Provided.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the provision of any Service as contemplated by this Agreement requires the consent, license or approval of any third party not previously obtained, the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts, to obtain as promptly as possible after the Commencement Date, any third party consents, permits, licenses and approvals required under the terms of any third party agreement in order for Provider to provide the Services hereunder. The cost of obtaining any consent, permit, license or approval with respect to any Service shall be borne by the Recipient of the relevant Services. If any such consent, permit, license or approval is not obtained, the Parties will cooperate in good faith to enter into reasonably acceptable arrangements under which Recipient would obtain the benefit of such Service to the same extent (or as nearly as practicable) as if such consent were obtained (at Recipient's cost), and each Party will continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such required consent or amendment. The Parties acknowledge that it may not be practical to try to anticipate and identify every possible legal, regulatory, and logistical impediment to the provision of Services hereunder. Accordingly, each Party will promptly notify the other Party if it reasonably determines that there is a legal, regulatory, or logistical impediment to the provision of any Service, and the Parties shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to overcome such impediments so that the Services may be provided otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Without limiting the rights and remedies of any party hereunder, in the event a virus or similar item is introduced into the Systems of a Party, whether or not such introduction is attributable to the other Party (including such other Party's failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement), the other Party shall, as soon as practicable, use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist such Party in reducing the effects of the virus or similar item, and if the virus or similar item causes a loss of operational efficiency or loss of data, upon such Party's request, work as soon as practicable to contain and remedy the problem and to restore lost data resulting from such introduction.\n\nSection 4.4 Providers' Software.

Orderly Marketing. 1.1 The shares of Stock held by each Seller Trust and subject to this OMA shall be as set out on Schedule A hereto, which Schedule may be amended from time to time in writing by the Parties in accordance with Section 4.1 below. 1.2 It is the goal of the Seller Trusts to have all of the Shares sold, on a pro-rata basis, in three or more tranches (each a \"Tranche\") commencing not earlier than six (6) months after the Effective Date with the resale of all of the shares of Stock completed as soon as practicable after the Effective Date.\n\n- 2 -\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3 [Reserved]. 1.4 The Seller Trusts and GWG intend to retain one or more nationally recognized bulge bracket investment banks (the \"Bank\") for the orderly marketing and resale of Shares pursuant to a separate engagement letter (the \"Engagement Letter\") to advise them in connection with the sale of the Tranches (together, the \"Offerings\"). Such Engagement Letter shall include customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnification provisions. The services to be performed by the Bank shall be set forth in such Engagement Letter and are expected to include, among others: (a) assisting in the drafting and preparation of one or more prospectus supplements describing GWG, the Shares and the terms of the Offerings; (b) advising the Seller Trusts on a marketing and distribution strategy for each Tranche of Shares, including whether a particular Tranche should be sold through a block trade, overnight bookbuild, or similar transaction; (c) assisting GWG in preparing marketing materials and conducting one or more \"roadshows\" and meetings with potential purchasers of the Shares; (d) advising the Seller Trusts as to the timing, structure and pricing of the Offerings; (e) providing other advisory services as are customary for similar transactions. The Engagement Letter shall include a requirement that, prior to any distribution of Stock by the Bank as contemplated by this Agreement, the Bank shall consult with each of GWG and the Trust Advisors as to the strategy for the marketing, sale and distribution of the respective Tranche. 1.5 After the Parties have agreed on the strategy for the marketing, sale and distribution of a Tranche, the Seller Trusts shall offer the Bank the right to serve as the lead left joint-book-running manager in connection with a best efforts distribution. GWG shall be entitled to appoint, in its discretion, an additional bank as joint book-running manager to participate in the distribution. The Seller Trusts further agree that in the event the Bank accepts such role it will be paid customary fees for the performance of its services in connection with such transactions and that such engagement will involve the execution of a standard form agreement with respect to the distribution of each Tranche, which may be in the form of a placement agency agreement, underwriting agreement or other appropriate agreement (each, a \"Distribution Agreement\"); provided, however, that nothing contained in this OMA or Engagement Letter shall require the Bank to underwrite or purchase all or any portion of a Tranche of Stock for its own account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that the Bank or its affiliates may, solely at its discretion and without any obligation to do so, purchase Stock in any Tranche as principal.\n\n- 3 -\n\n\n\n\n\n1.6 Each such Distribution Agreement shall set out the customary terms and conditions for the sale and distribution of the respective Tranche, including customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnification provisions. For the avoidance of doubt, each Distribution Agreement shall include provisions to the following effect: (i) GWG shall have no responsibility for the payment of fees or commissions payable to the Bank, which fees and commissions shall be the responsibility of certain affiliates of the Seller Trusts as set forth in the applicable Distribution Agreement; and (ii) each of GWG and the Seller Trusts shall agree to provide a customary indemnity in favor of the Bank and its affiliates. 1.7 If, in connection with the marketing, sale and distribution of a Tranche, the Bank determines that the number of Shares of Stock proposed to be included in the Tranche exceeds the number that can reasonably be sold, then the number of Shares of Stock shall be reduced accordingly on a pro-rata basis with respect to each of the Seller Trusts. 1.8 Prior to the offering of each Tranche, GWG shall provide the placement agents or underwriters in such Offering a list of the top 100 institutional holders of the Common Stock. In connection with any Offering, the Seller Trusts shall instruct the placement agents or underwriters to use their reasonable best efforts to (i) effect as wide a distribution of the Shares as is reasonably practicable without adversely affecting the pricing thereof and (ii) not sell any Shares to any person or Group (as such terms is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\")) who, upon completion of the Offering, would have Beneficial Ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of shares of Common Stock representing in the aggregate 5.0% or more the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock (or in the case of a person of the type described in Rule 13d-1(b)(1)(i) under the Exchange Act, 10% or more of the Total Voting Power). Section 2. Compensation. The Engagement Letter shall provide that the Bank shall not be entitled to any compensation for its advice hereunder or reimbursement of its expenses in connection with this OMA and shall only be entitled to compensation in connection with an Offering as provided in the Engagement Letter and related Distribution Agreement with respect to such Offering. Section 3. [Reserved] Section 4. General Provisions. 4.1 Term; Termination; Withdrawal of Bank.

In the event the Bank provides such notice at any time prior to the sale of greater than 50% of the Shares and within 12 months of the Effective Date, then GWG and the Trust Advisors may elect (A) to terminate this OMA or (B) to continue this OMA and to seek to appoint a substitute investment bank, in which case GWG, after consultation with the Trust Advisors, shall be entitled to appoint a substitute investment bank to serve as the lead joint-book-running manager for the sale of the Shares. In the event the Bank terminates the Engagement Letter at any time following the sale of greater than 50% of the Shares and within 12 months of the Effective Date, the termination thereof shall constitute a concurrent Termination of this OMA. 4.2 Amendments and Waivers.

If the ValueAct Designee is appointed to the Board pursuant to this Section 1(a), the Company shall include the ValueAct Designee as a Class I Director, which term expires at the Company's 2016 annual meeting of stockholders.\n\n(b) As a condition to the ValueAct Designee's appointment to the Board, the ValueAct Group, including the ValueAct Designee, agrees to provide to the Company information required to be or customarily disclosed for directors, candidates for directors, and their affiliates and representatives in a proxy statement or other filings under applicable law or stock exchange rules or listing standards, information in connection with assessing eligibility, independence and other criteria applicable to directors or satisfying compliance and legal obligations, and such other information as reasonably requested by the Company from time to time with respect to the ValueAct Group and the ValueAct Designee.\n\n(c) The ValueAct Designee agrees that, at all times while serving as a member of the Board, he will (i) meet all director independence and other standards of the Company, the New York Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and applicable provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, including Rule 10A- 3; and (ii) be qualified to serve as a director under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \"DGCL\") (clauses (i) and (ii), the \"Conditions\").

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of the occurrence of an event set forth in subsection (ii) or (iv) above, the provisions of Section 1(e) must be complied with before the Company's obligations hereunder may terminate.\n\n(g) The percentage thresholds set forth in clauses (e) and (f) above shall not be deemed unsatisfied to the extent a failure to maintain the specified ownership thresholds is the result of share issuances or similar Company actions that increase the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock.\n\n2.

It is agreed that all such merchandise must be mutually approved in all respects by the parties hereto, including, without limitation, the style, design and cost thereof.\n\n      (d)   In addition to and separate from any other remuneration hereunder, if Company uses any performance or service of Manning hereunder in any way that is subject to the jurisdiction of any applicable artists' union, guild or other organization (including, without limitation, SAG and AFTRA), either during or after the Contract Period, Company shall pay directly to such organization all minimum payments or fees (for benefit plans or otherwise) required to be made with respect to Manning's performance or services.\n\n      (e)   If, at any time during the Contract Period, Company shall enter into any agreement (the terms of what are significantly the same as the terms hereof) in connection with the production and sale of Company's products using the name, likeness, photographic representation or signature of any other National Football League quarterback (active or retired), which agreement provides for the payment to such individual of remuneration in excess of that set forth herein, then Company agrees it will immediately so notify Pey Dirt\n\n                                     -3-\n\nand, at the same time, shall, retroactive to the effective date of such other agreement, increase the rate of remuneration paid to Pey Dirt hereunder up to the highest then-current rate paid by Company to any such National Football League quarterback (active or retired) for a regional endorsement deal.\n\n      5.    Notices and Submissions.  Pey Dirt hereby designates International Merchandising Corporation, IMG Center, Suite 100, 1360 East 9th Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44114, Attn.: Peter Johnson, as Pey Dirt's authorized agent for all purposes hereunder.  All notices, submissions and/or requests for approval to be made, obtained or delivered by Company to Pey Dirt pursuant to this Agreement shall be delivered to said address free of all charges such as, for example, shipping charges and customs charges.  In the event that any such charges are paid by Pey Dirt or by Pey Dirt's authorized agent, Company agrees to make prompt reimbursement.\n\n      6.    Payments; Books and Records. (a) Pey Dirt may elect to have\n\n\n\n\n\npayments made by check, wire transfer or bank transfer.  Unless such election has been made in writing, all payments shall be made by check drawn to the order of \"Pey Dirt, Inc.\" and delivered to IMG, Suite 100, 1360 East 9th Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44114, Attn.: Peter Johnson.  Past due payments hereunder shall bear interest at the rate of (i) one and one-half percent (1-1/2%) per month, or (ii) the maximum interest rate permissible under law, whichever is less.\n\n      (b)   Company agrees that it will keep accurate and complete records and books of account showing all Endorsed Products shipped by it and the price thereof.  Pey Dirt, or its representatives, shall, upon two weeks' written notice, have the right at all reasonable times (prior to the expiration of two (2) years after the termination of the Contract Period) to inspect and make copies of the books and records of Company insofar as they shall relate to the computation of royalties to be paid to Pey Dirt hereunder and the shipment of Endorsed Products pursuant to this Agreement.  In the event that any such inspections show an underreporting and underpayment in excess of five percent (5%) for any twelve (12) month period, then Company shall pay the cost of such examination.\n\n      7.    Labels/Packaging. (a) It is understood that each of the Endorsed Products shipped by Company or its container or the packaging therefor shall have affixed thereto a label or other permanent identification which includes Manning Identification.\n\n      (b)   It is hereby agreed that the back panel of the Endorsed Products' packaging will feature ad copy or offers as determined by Pey Dirt and its agent, subject to Company's right to reasonably reject such materials only if such materials are clearly offensive to a majority of the populace.  Any and all revenues generated by such ad copy or offers shall be disbursed in accordance with Section 4(c) above.  Further, the side panel of the Endorsed Products packaging shall feature a charity or other entity of Manning's sole choice.  All packaging costs shall be Company's sole responsibility.\n\n                                      -4-\n\n      8.    Trademarks.  Should Company, at any time or times during the Contract Period, desire to register a trademark or trademarks which include Manning Identification, or which relate in any manner to Manning, and/or to register Company as a user thereof, Pey Dirt shall execute any and all documents which the parties reasonably believe to be necessary or desirable for registration or protection of such trademark or trademarks in the name of Manning.  All costs related to any such trademarks shall be borne by Company, and ownership of any such trademarks shall rest solely in the name of Pey Dirt or its designee.  Upon registration of any such trademark, Pey Dirt shall grant to Company a license for the use of such registered trademark on or in connection with the advertisement, promotion and sale of Endorsed Products, which license shall be coextensive and coterminous with the rights granted thereunder with respect to Manning Identification and shall require no increase in the payments set forth but shall contain such additional provisions as Pey Dirt reasonably believes are necessary for the protection of such trademark registered in the name of Manning or Pey Dirt. Company agrees that it will not file, during the Contract Period or thereafter, any application for trademark registration or otherwise obtain or attempt to obtain ownership of any trademark or trade name within the Contract Territory or in any other country of the world which consists of Manning Identification or any mark, design or logo intended to make reference to Manning or to identify products endorsed by Manning.  In the event that, prior to the Contract Period, Company has filed one or more applications for registration of any such trademark, or otherwise has obtained any rights to such trademark, Company agrees to cause such applications and/or trademarks to be assigned and transferred to Pey Dirt forthwith.\n\n      9.    Products for the Use of Pey Dirt. During the Contract Period, Company shall supply Pey Dirt and/or its agent with such amounts of Endorsed Products as Pey Dirt and/or its agent may reasonably request.  Company agrees to pay all charges in connection with the delivery of Endorsed Products to Pey Dirt and/or Pey Dirt's agent, including shipping charges, air freight charges and customs charges.  Company agrees to reimburse Pey Dirt's authorized agent for all such expenses incurred by it in connection with the transfer of Endorsed Products to Pey Dirt and/or Pey Dirt's agent.\n\n      10.   Services of Manning.  If Company desires to utilize the services of Manning as a model in connection with photographs or drawings for advertising or for personal appearances, Pey Dirt agrees, at the reasonable request of Company and upon adequate notice, to provide the services of Manning at a time and place reasonably convenient to the schedule of Manning. Company agrees that it will reimburse Pey Dirt for reasonable travel (including first class air fare), lodging, ground transportation and meal expenses incurred by Manning and one traveling companion designated by Manning.  Company further agrees it will reimburse Pey Dirt's authorized agent for reasonable travel (including air fare), lodging and meal expenses incurred in providing one representative to accompany Manning.  Company understands that if services are requested hereunder, such services may be coordinated with similar services for others entitled to the use of Manning Identification in other connections.  Company further understands that such services may be required not more than once during the Contract Period for up to one (1) hour. In the event that Company elects to use the services of Manning in connection with television\n\n                                      -5-\n\n\n\n\n\nadvertising, Company shall make all required union scale and union pension and welfare payments.  Company further understands that failure to utilize services of Manning pursuant to this section shall not result in any reduction in payments to Pey Dirt hereunder, nor may the obligation to provide services be carried past the Contract Period.  The obligations of Pey Dirt to provide the services of Manning hereunder are subject to the condition that payments to Pey Dirt are current and up to date.\n\n      11.   Force Majeure.  If, at any time during this Agreement, Pey Dirt or Manning is prevented from or hampered or interrupted or interfered with in any manner whatever in fully performing its/his duties hereunder, by reason of any present or future statute, law, ordinance, regulation, order, judgment or decree, whether legislative, executive or judicial (whether or not valid), act of God, earthquake, fire, flood, epidemic, accident, explosion, casualty, lockout, boycott, strike, labor controversy (including but not limited to threat of lockout, boycott or strike), riot, civil disturbance, war or armed conflict (whether or not there has been an official declaration of war or official statement as to the existence of a state of war), invasion, occupation, intervention of military forces, act of public enemy, embargo, delay of a common carrier, inability without default on Company's part to obtain sufficient material, labor, transportation, power or other essential commodity required in the conduct of its business; or by reason of any cause beyond his reasonable control; or by reason of any other cause of any similar nature (all of the foregoing being herein referred to as an \"event of force majeure\"), then Pey Dirt's/Manning's obligations hereunder shall be suspended as often as any such event of force majeure occurs and during such periods of time as such events of force majeure exist and such non-performance shall not be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement.\n\n      12.   Default. (a) If either party at any time during the Contract Period shall (i) fail to make any payment of any sum of money herein specified to be made, or (ii) fail to observe or perform any of the covenants, agreements or obligations hereunder (other than the payment of money), the non-defaulting party may terminate this Agreement as follows: as to subparagraph (i) if such payment is not made within ten (10) days after the defaulting party shall have received written notice of such failure to make payment, or as to subparagraph (ii) if such default is not cured within thirty (30) days after the defaulting party shall have received written notice specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such default.  In order to be a sufficient notice hereunder, any such written notice shall specify in detail each item of default and shall specify the provision of this Agreement which applies to each item of default, and shall specify in detail the action the defaulting party must take in order to cure each such item of default. The termination rights set forth in this section shall not constitute the exclusive remedy of the nondefaulting party hereunder, however, and if default is made by either party hereunder, the other may resort to such other remedies as said party would have been entitled to if this section had been omitted from this Agreement.  Termination under the provisions of this section shall be without prejudice to any rights or claims which the terminating party may otherwise have against the defaulting party.\n\n                                      -6-\n\n      (b)   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the cure periods set forth in subparagraphs (a)(i) and (a)(ii) above only apply to Company's first default under this Agreement.  Accordingly, Pey Dirt may, after Company's first default has occurred under either subparagraph (a)(i) or subparagraph (a)(ii) above and has been cured, thereafter immediately terminate this Agreement upon any further defaults by Company hereunder without providing Company an opportunity to cure any additional defaults.\n\n      13.   Termination.  From and after the termination of the Contract Period all of the rights of Company to the use of Manning Identification shall cease absolutely and Company shall not thereafter use or refer to Manning Identification in advertising or promotion in any manner whatsoever, it being understood by Company that Manning Identification may be used at any time by others in connection with the advertisement and promotion of Products the shipment of which is completed after the termination of the Contract Period.  It is further agreed that following termination of the Contract Period, Company shall not advertise, promote, distribute or sell any item whatsoever in connection with the use of any name, figure, design, logo, trademark or trade name similar to or suggestive of Manning Identification.\n\n      14.   Inventory of Endorsed Products on Termination/Expiration.  Any Endorsed Products that may have been manufactured by or for Company prior to the termination or expiration of the Contract Period may be sold by Company during the ninety (90) day period next following the date of termination or expiration; provided, however, that Company shall have no such rights unless (a) Company is not in default of any of its obligations hereunder on the date of termination or expiration, (b) within fifteen (15) days after the date of termination or expiration, Company shall furnish to Pey Dirt a written statement of the number and description of Endorsed Products actually in stock on the date of termination or expiration, (c) the quantity of Endorsed Products in stock on the date of termination or expiration is not in excess of a reasonable inventory based upon Company's selling requirements of Endorsed Products during the Contract Period, (d) Company shall continue to pay to Pey Dirt with respect to such sales a royalty at the rates specified herein, and (e) royalties payable pursuant to this section shall be paid within thirty (30) days following the end of each calendar month with respect\n\n\n\n\n\nto shipments made during such month.\n\n     15.   Collegiate/National Football League Trademarks.  Nothing contained herein shall be construed to convey to Company any rights to use the trademarks, logos or uniform of the University of Tennessee, the Indianapolis Colts, the National Football League or any other professional or amateur football association (including any member clubs or teams of such association) in conjunction with the rights granted hereunder.  All rights to the use of such trademarks, logos or team identification must be acquired from the University of Tennessee, the Indianapolis Colts, the National Football League, or any other appropriate rights holder.\n\n      16.   Indemnity.  Company agrees to protect, indemnify and save harmless Pey Dirt, Pey Dirt's agent and Manning, or any of them, from and against any and all expenses, damages, claims, suits, actions, judgments and costs whatsoever, including reasonable attorneys' fees,\n\n                                     -7-\n\narising out of, or in any way connected with, this Agreement, Company's default hereunder, the negligence, actions, errors or omissions of Company or any claim or action for personal injury, death or otherwise involving alleged defects in Company's Products, provided that Company shall be given notice of any such action or claim.  Company agrees to provide and maintain, at its own expense, general liability insurance and product liability insurance with limits no less than $3,000,000 and within thirty (30) days from the date hereof, Company will submit to Pey Dirt a fully paid policy or certificate of insurance naming Pey Dirt, Pey Dirt's agent and Manning as additional insured parties, requiring that the insurer shall not terminate or materially modify such without written notice to Pey Dirt at least twenty (20) days in advance thereof.\n\n      17.   Waiver.  The failure of either party at any time or times to demand strict performance by the other of any of the terms, covenants or conditions set forth herein shall not be construed as a continuing waiver or relinquishment thereof and each may at any time demand strict and complete performance by the other of said terms, covenants and conditions.\n\n      18.   Bankruptcy. If Company shall become bankrupt or insolvent, or if Company's business shall   be placed in the hands of a Receiver, Assignee or Trustee, whether by voluntary act of Company r otherwise, the Contract Period shall, at the option of Pey Dirt, immediately terminate.\n\n      19.   Assignment. This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of Pey Dirt and the successors and assigns of Pey Dirt.  Nothing herein shall prevent Pey Dirt from assigning the monetary benefits of this Agreement as it may so desire.  Further, inasmuch as it is recognized that Pey Dirt is the representative of Manning, Pey Dirt may at any time assign this Agreement to Manning and, in such event, Pey Dirt shall have no further obligation or liability in connection herewith and Pey Dirt's position vis-a-vis Company in connection herewith shall be in all respects the same as if Pey Dirt had signed this Agreement as agent rather than as principal from the beginning. The rights granted Company hereunder shall be used only by it and shall not, without the prior written consent of Pey Dirt, be transferred or assigned to any other.  In the event of the merger or consolidation of Company with any other entity, Pey Dirt shall have the right to terminate the Contract Period by so notifying Company in writing on or before sixty (60) days after Pey Dirt has received notice of such merger or consolidation.\n\n      20.   Arbitration.  In the event a dispute arises under this agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration and resolved by a single arbitrator (who shall be a lawyer) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect.  All such arbitration shall take place at the office of the American Arbitration Association located in Nashville, Tennessee.  Each party is entitled to depose one (1) fact witness and any expert witness designated by the other party, and to conduct such other discovery as the arbitrator deems appropriate.  The award or decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court.\n\n                                       -8-\n\n      21.

Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed and construed according to the law of Tennessee.\n\n      24.   Reservation of Rights.  All rights not herein specifically\n\n\n\n\n\ngranted to Company shall remain the property of Pey Dirt to be used in any manner Pey Dirt deems appropriate.  Company understands that Pey Dirt has reserved to itself the right to authorize others to use Pey Dirt Identification within the Contract Territory and during the Contract Period in connection with all tangible and intangible items and services other than Products themselves.\n\n      25.   No Joint Venture.  This Agreement does not constitute and shall not be construed as constituting a partnership or joint venture between Turn 2 and Company.  Neither party shall have any right to obligate or bind the other party in any manner whatsoever, and nothing herein contained shall give, or is intended to give, any rights of any kind to any third person.\n\n      26.   Authorization.  The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Company and by Pey Dirt has been duly authorized and approved by the Board of Directors of Company and by the Board of Directors of Pey Dirt and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Company and of Pey Dirt enforceable in accordance with its terms.\n\n      27.

Acceptance of the offer made herein is expressly limited to the terms of the offer.\n\n      28.   Liability.

Under no circumstances will Manning or Pey Dirt, on the one hand, or Company, on the other hand, be liable to the other or any other entity for any special, consequential, indirect, exemplary and/or punitive damages, or for loss of good will or business profits.\n\n                                       -9-\n\n      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the par-ties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed as of the date first above written.\n\nFAMOUS FIXINS, INC.
