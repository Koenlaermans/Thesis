LOCATION. During the Term (as defined in Section 6 (a) below), NAI shall      provide the following marketing considerations to Co-Host:\n\n  (a)  Co-Hosting Rights. Co-Host shall be permitted to maintain on the           Online Service Page (as defined in Part 2 of Exhibit \"A\") of the           Originating Locations in the manner set forth on Exhibit \"B\" hereto           (and on such other positions as are set forth on Exhibit \"B\" or as the           parties may mutually agree upon in writing from time to time) a hot           link to Internet locations specified by the Co-Host (the           \"Destination\") from which Goods (other than Competitor's Goods           (hereinafter defined)) may be sold. The web pages at the Destination           shall be maintained in accordance with the requirements of this           Agreement, including without limitation, Section 2 hereof.           \"Competitor's Goods\" as used herein shall mean the Goods of any of the           persons or entities described on Part 1 of Exhibit \"C\" attached hereto           and made a part hereof. The Destination shall not contain any links to           any third party sites for the purchase of Competitor's Goods; provided           that the Destination will link to the Co-Host Site (which will sell           Competitor's Goods).\n\n  (b)  Exclusive Positioning. Co-Host shall be the exclusive reseller of           software products (\"Software\") at the Originating Locations. The           preceding sentence shall not prohibit NAI from (i) reselling Software           including NAI Goods (hereinafter defined) from the McAfee Mall; (ii)           referencing and linking to sites of strategic partners (other than           competitors of Co-Host listed on Part 2 of Exhibit \"C\") which may also           be involved in the resale of Software from such sites; provided that           no Software may be purchased on the page of such site which is linked           to any Originating Location and further provided that the references           and links to the sites of strategic partners shall not be placed on           the Online Service Page; and (iii) advertising Software with banners,           buttons and other forms of online advertising; provided that any link           from such advertising takes the end user to the publisher of the           Software and not a reseller of Goods (other than Co-Host). For           example, an advertising banner or button for the Windows 98 software           program may link back to the website of Microsoft Corporation but not           the website of Dell Computer Corporation which is reselling the           program. Without limitation on the foregoing, NAI may co-host a           comparative shopping service on the Originating Locations. NAI will           obtain a written covenant that the comparative shopping co-host will           present sellers of Software in a neutral manner and upon request of           Co-Host will require removal or alteration of presentations by such           co-host on such co-hosted facility which Co-Host reasonably deems to           be non-neutral; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the           foregoing, Co-Host may be the featured or most prominent Software           reseller on any such service.\n\n  (c)  Short Term Product Exclusives. For a period of fourteen (14) days           following release of any new NAI Goods or major version releases           (i.e., version 3.0 to 4.0) of existing NAI Goods, Co-Host shall be the           exclusive online seller of any such\n\n                                    3    4\n\n       release released during the Term. \"NAI Goods\" as used herein shall           mean retail desktop software products offered by NAI under the           \"McAfee\" brand or other NAI owned brand, which NAI makes available for           resale through distributors and resellers via the Internet.\n\n  (d)  Reference Site. Co-Host may refer to the Originating Locations as a           Co-Host customer location and to NAI as a Co-Host customer hereunder           provided all such references shall be subject to the prior review and           approval of NAI, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld.\n\n  (e)  Links to Online Service Page. Any end user accessing the principal           URLs of NAI (e.g., mcafee.com, cybermedia.com, pgp.com, tis.com) shall           be taken to the Online Service Page. Any end user accessing a \"buy\"           button on any of the Originating Locations shall be taken to the           Online Service Page. NAI shall not sell retail desktop consumer           products, including without limitation, NAI Goods from the NAI           Internet Sites (other than the McAfee Mall).\n\n       NAI reserves the right to change the URL of the Originating Locations           from time to time and agrees to give Co-Host as much notice of any           such change as is practicable.\n\n2.   MARKETING AND SALES.\n\n  (a)  Placement of Order. In consideration of the Co-Hosting Fee set forth           in Part 3 of Exhibit \"A\", NAI shall provide the marketing           consideration identified in Section 1 during the Term of this\n\n\n\n\n\n       Agreement.\n\n  (b)  Advertising Materials; Destination Operation. Co-Host shall provide to           NAI artwork and text materials with respect to the advertisement of           the Destination at the Originating Locations. Such artwork and           materials must be non-infringing, inoffensive, accurate, truthful and           otherwise comply with all applicable laws. Co-Host shall comply with           all applicable laws in connection with the operation of the           Destination, including without limitation, requirements regarding the           confidentiality of information concerning end users. NAI retains the           right, but not the obligation, to disapprove or remove any           advertisements or advertising materials it reasonably deems illegal,           inappropriate or otherwise inconsistent with the purposes of the           Originating Sites, without the consent of Co-Host.\n\n  (c)  Use of Trademarks. Co-Host hereby grants to NAI a non-exclusive,           non-transferable, royalty-free license during the term of this           Agreement to use the trademarks, service marks and trade names of           Co-Host in connection with the advertising and promotion of the Goods           from the Originating Locations, provided that NAI complies with the           terms of Section 9(b) of the Web Site Services Agreement (as defined           below). Co-Host reserves the right to terminate the foregoing right,           after giving NAI notice and opportunity to cure the allegedly harmful           use, if in Co-Host's reasonable judgment, NAI's use of such           trademarks, service marks and trade names harms the business, image or           goodwill of Co-Host.\n\n                                    4    5\n\n  (d)  Limited Duty of Promotion. NAI shall have no duty or obligation to           advertise or promote the Goods, other than as set forth in this           Section 2. Except as expressly set forth herein (including, without           limitation, as set forth in this Section 2(d)), NAI does not,           expressly or impliedly, guaranty or warrant any results or level of           sales or customer leads to Co-Host. NAI reserves the right to cease           publication of the Originating Locations for brief periods from time           to time for maintenance or other purposes; provided that the           Originating Locations will comply with the same \"Uptime Requirements\"           specified with respect to the \"Managed Site\" in the Web Site Services           Agreement.\n\n  (e)  Marketing Promotions. During the Term, Co-Host and NAI will regularly           discuss and implement mutually agreed upon jointly funded marketing           promotions. NAI and Co-Host hereby agree that the marketing promotions           set forth on Exhibit \"D\" hereto will be implemented as set forth on           Exhibit \"D\".\n\n  (f)  Distribution of Physical Products. NAI grants to Co-Host the right to           distribute physical copies of NAI's Goods to end users ordering from           the Managed Site, the Destination or Beyond.com upon the terms set           forth in Exhibit \"E\" attached hereto and made a part hereof.\n\n3.   PAYMENT AND RECORDS.\n\n  (a)  Fees. Subject to the provisions of Section 6 hereof, Co-Host shall pay           to NAI the amount designated in Part 3 of Exhibit \"A\" as the           Co-Hosting Fee upon the schedule set forth in such Part.\n\n  (b)  Payment Terms. Except as set forth in such Part 3 of Exhibit \"A\",           payments from Co-Host to NAI shall be due thirty (30) days from the           date of invoice. All payments will be made in United States dollars,           free of any taxes then currently applicable, at the address designated           above by NAI. Late payments shall bear interest at the lesser of: (i)           the maximum rate permitted by law, and (ii) the rate of 1.5% per month           from the due date until paid.\n\n4.   EQUITABLE RELIEF. Each party acknowledges that any breach of its      obligations under this Agreement with respect to the proprietary rights or      confidential information of the other party will cause the other party      irreparable injury for which there are inadequate remedies at law, and      therefore such other party will be entitled to equitable relief in addition      to all other remedies provided by this Agreement or available at law.\n\n5.   PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. NAI retains ownership of the NAI Internet Site, the      Originating Locations, the trademarks and all intellectual property rights      in connection with the NAI Internet Site, including without limitation, its      URL designations and all rights from InterNIC in connection therewith.      Co-Host and its licensors retain ownership of all intellectual property      rights in the advertising materials provided, the trademarks and all      intellectual property rights in connection with the Destination and the      Co-Host Site, including, without limitation, its URL designations and all      rights from InterNIC in connection therewith, and all of its other      intellectual property rights.\n\n                                    5    6\n\n6.   TERM AND TERMINATION.\n\n  (a)  Term. This Agreement will commence on the Effective Date, and will           terminate on the third anniversary of the Effective Date (the \"Term\"),           unless earlier terminated as provided in this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n  (b)  Termination. A party may terminate this Agreement immediately: (i) if           the other party engages in any material unlawful business practice and           such practice continues uncured thirty (30) days following written           notice thereof, (ii) if the other party fails to perform any material           obligation, (which shall include, without limitation, the payment           obligations hereunder and compliance with the Uptime Requirements in           respect of the Originating Locations) or violates any material           restriction contained in this Agreement and such failure continues           uncured thirty (30) days following written notice thereof, (iii) by           such party if that certain Web Site Services Agreement between NAI and           Co-Host dated of even date herewith (the \"Web Site Services           Agreement\") or the ESD Agreement is terminated by the other party,           (iv) if a receiver is appointed for the other party or its property,           (v) if the other party makes an assignment for the benefit of           creditors, (vi) if the other party becomes the subject of any           proceeding under any bankruptcy, insolvency or debtor's relief law,           (vii) upon ninety (90) days prior notice in writing by Co-Host at any           time after June 30, 2000, if the term of the Web Site Services           Agreement has not been renewed for an additional term of one (1) year           or more pursuant to its terms or (viii) if the party terminates the           Web Site Services Agreement by reason of the other party's material           default thereunder.\n\n  (c)  Effect of Termination. Upon the effective date of the termination, all           outstanding invoices and other invoicable amounts will become due and           payable. Co-Host's contractual right to the marketing consideration           shall cease immediately upon the effective date of the termination.           Termination or expiration of this Agreement if by reason of material           breach by Co-Host shall not affect any of Co-Host's payment           obligations, all of which survive termination of this Agreement;           provided that, in (i) the event of termination of this Agreement by           Co-Host due to a material default by NAI, NAI shall pay to the Co-Host           the Liquidated Damages Amount (as defined in Part 2 of Exhibit \"A\").\n\n7.   CONFIDENTIALITY. Confidential Information disclosed by either party in      writing and marked as \"confidential,\" proprietary\" or the like (or      disclosed verbally if a written summary is provided within thirty days),      including any information relating to such party's research, development,      proprietary technology, product and marketing plans, finances, personnel      and business opportunities will be considered confidential information.      Each party will not use the other party's confidential information except      as required to achieve the objectives of this Agreement and will not      disclose such confidential information except to employees, agents and      contractors who have a need to know in the discharge of their duties under      this Agreement. Such restrictions will not apply to information that      becomes public knowledge other than through the disclosing party, is      independently developed by the non-disclosing party, or is lawfully      required to be disclosed by any governmental agency or otherwise required      to be disclosed by law.\n\n                                    6    7\n\n  Neither party will make any disclosure of, or statement covering, the terms      of this Agreement, including the financial terms, to any third parties      (other than its attorneys, accountants and professional consultants),      without obtaining the other's prior written consent, except as required by      court order or applicable regulatory authorities, including without      limitation, the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange      Commission, any stock exchange and the NASDAQ. The parties agree that under      their current understanding, disclosure of the financial terms of this      Agreement is not required under the foregoing rules and regulations. The      obligations of this Section 7 shall survive the termination of this      Agreement, under any circumstances. The parties shall make a joint press      release announcing the relationship, the timing and content of which shall      be subject to the mutual agreement of the parties.\n\n8.   RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES. The parties are independent contractors and      not partners, joint venturers or agents, and neither party may obligate the      other to any warranty or other obligation. Neither NAI nor Co-Host is by      virtue of this Agreement authorized as an agent or other representative of      the other party.\n\n9.   REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND INDEMNIFICATION.\n\n  (a)  Co-Host represents and warrants to NAI that Co-Host has all right,           title, ownership interest and/or marketing rights necessary to provide           the advertising materials to NAI, to perform its obligations hereunder           and to operate the Destination. Each party further represents and           warrants to the other that it has not entered into any agreements or           commitments which are inconsistent with or in conflict with the rights           granted or obligations incurred by the representing party in this           Agreement. Co-Host further represents and warrants that the           advertising materials supplied hereunder do not infringe any Covered           Country (hereinafter defined) copyright, trademark, or trade secret           right. Covered Country shall mean the United States of America and any           member state of the European Economic Union. Co-Host agrees that, if           notified promptly in writing and given sole control of the defense and           all related settlement negotiations, it will defend NAI, its           employees, officers and agents, against any claim based on an           allegation that (i) advertising materials supplied hereunder infringes           a Covered Country patent, copyright, trademark or state trade secret           right, or (ii) Co-Host violated any law, statute or ordinance or any           governmental or administrative order, rule or regulation with regard\n\n\n\n\n\n       to the advertising materials, the operation of the Destination or the           manufacture, possession, distribution, use or sale of the Goods.           Co-Host will pay any resulting costs, damages and attorneys' fees           finally awarded by a court, or agreed to in settlement by Co-Host,           with respect to any such claims. NAI agrees that, if the advertising           materials become, or in Co-Host's opinion are likely to become, the           subject of an infringement claim, NAI will permit Co-Host, at           Co-Host's option and expense, to, among other things, procure the           right for NAI to continue marketing and using the advertising           materials, or to replace or modify them so that they become           non-infringing.\n\n                                    7    8\n\n  (b)  NAI represents and warrants that NAI has all right, title, ownership           interest and/or marketing rights necessary to operate the Originating           Locations, provide the Products to Co-Host, and the Products shall be           free and clear of all liens and encumbrances. NAI further represents           and warrants that it has not entered into any agreements or           commitments which are inconsistent with or in conflict with the rights           granted to Co-Host in this Agreement. NAI further represents and           warrants that the Products supplied hereunder do not infringe any           Covered Country patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret right.           NAI agrees that, if notified promptly in writing and given sole           control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations, it           will defend Co-Host, its employees, officers and agents against any           claim based on an allegation that (i) a Product supplied hereunder           infringes a Covered Country patent, copyright, trademark or trade           secret right, or (ii) NAI violated any law, statute or ordinance or           any governmental or administrative order, rule or regulation with           regard to a Product or its manufacturer, possession, use or sale. NAI           will pay any resulting costs, damages and attorneys' fees finally           awarded by a court, or agreed to in settlement by NAI, with respect to           any such claims to the extent of the compensation received under this           Agreement. Co-Host agrees that, if the Products in the inventory of           Co-Host, or the operation thereof, become, or in NAI's opinion are           likely to become, the subject of an infringement claim, Co-Host will           permit NAI, at NAI's option and expense, to, among other things,           procure the right for Co-Host to continue marketing and using such           Products, or to replace or modify them so that they become           non-infringing. If neither of the foregoing alternatives is available           on terms that NAI deems reasonable, Co-Host will return such Products           on written request from NAI. NAI will grant Co-Host a credit equal to           the price paid by Co-Host for such returned Products, as adjusted for           discounts, returns and credits actually given, provided that such           returned Products are in an undamaged condition. NAI will have no           obligation to Co-Host with respect to infringement of patents,           copyrights, trademarks or trade secrets or other proprietary rights           beyond that stated in this Section 9(b).\n\n  (c)  No Combination Claims. Notwithstanding Section 9(b), NAI will not be           liable to Co-Host for any claims to the extent they arise solely based           upon the combination, operation or use of any Product with equipment,           data or programming not supplied by NAI, or to the extent they arise           solely based upon the alteration or modification of the Products by           the Co-Host or the purchaser of such Products.\n\n10.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS UNDER SECTION 9 HEREOF, THE      LIABILITY OF A PARTY TO THE OTHER FOR DIRECT DAMAGES SHALL NOT EXCEED      FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. EXCLUSIVE OF ANY CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES FOR      INJURY OR DAMAGES TO PERSONS OR TANGIBLE PROPERTY DIRECTLY CAUSED BY ANY      PRODUCT, NEITHER PARTY'S LIABILITY WITH REGARD TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE      ADVERTISING MATERIALS, IF ANY, WILL INCLUDE CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL,      SPECIAL OR OTHER INDIRECT DAMAGES, SUCH AS LOST PROFITS, EVEN IF\n\n                                    8    9\n\n  THE OTHER PARTY HAS KNOWLEDGE OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n11.  FORCE MAJEURE. Neither party shall be liable for the failure to perform any      of its obligations under this Agreement, except for payment obligations, if      such failure is caused by the occurrence of any event beyond the reasonable      control of such party, including without limitation, fire, flood, strikes      and other industrial disturbances, failure of raw materials suppliers,      failure of transport, accidents, transmission difficulties, phone service      interruptions, riots, insurrections, acts of God or orders of governmental      agencies.\n\n12.  GENERAL.\n\n  (a)  This Agreement, the Web Site Services Agreement and the certain ESD           Agreement between the parties set forth the entire agreement between           the parties on all subject matters and supercede all prior agreements           and understandings between the parties.\n\n  (b)  This Agreement may not be changed, terminated or amended except in           writing.

APPOINTMENT. NAI appoints Co-Host as a non-exclusive distributor of the      Products to end users ordering the Products from the Destination or the      Co-Host Site, and Co-Host accepts this appointment. Co-Host shall      distribute the Products, as an independent reseller, at its own risk and      expense and subject to any such prices, contractual terms and conditions as      Co-Host may from time to time determine. Nothing in this Agreement shall      prohibit Co-Host from distributing competing products in the Territory. The      \"Territory\" as that term is used herein shall mean all countries in the      world except countries to which export or re-export of any Product, or the      direct products of any Product is prohibited by United States law without      first obtaining the permission of the United States Office of Export      Administration or its successor. Co-Host shall not have the right to assign      or otherwise transfer this Agreement or any rights herein granted to any      other person or entity, except by operation of law or in connection with      the sale of all of its assets, or the acquisition of the Co-Host by a third      party. Any such attempted assignment shall be void and the Agreement shall      remain in effect.\n\n2.   DISTRIBUTION. Co-Host has the right to market and distribute the Products      subject to the license agreement that accompanies such Product. Co-Host may\n\n\n\n\n\n  not engage in the rental of any of the Products. Co-Host shall not in any      event remove from or obscure upon any Products any labels placed thereon by      NAI containing statements of restrictions upon distribution, without the      prior written consent of NAI. NAI reserves the right in its sole discretion      and without liability to Co-Host to add additional Products, change the      prices for the Products pursuant to Section 5, modify the Products, change      the level of NAI's support for the Products and discontinue the      availability of any Product. Any addition or deletion from the list of      Products will be indicated by NAI's revision to the NAI price list, and NAI      will use reasonable efforts to provide Co-Host with thirty (30) days notice      prior to the effective date of such changes indicated on the NAI price      list.\n\n                                    2    17\n\n3.   MARKETING.\n\n  (a)  General. Co-Host will use commercially reasonable efforts to market           the Products it orders to the best of its ability, and to that end           will (i) conduct marketing activities authorized by NAI, (ii) support           special promotions initiated by NAI, and (iii) maintain a sound           financial condition. Co-Host will conduct its business in a manner           that reflects favorably upon the Products and NAI.\n\n  (b)  Advertising; Use of Trademarks. Co-Host may advertise and promote the           Products in a commercially reasonable manner and, subject to the           provisions of Section 5 of the Co-Hosting Agreement, may use           trademarks, service marks and trade names provided by NAI in           connection therewith, provided that all such promotions and           advertising will be consistent with NAI's general quality standards           and the provisions of Section 5 of the Co-Hosting Agreement. Unless           otherwise agreed upon in writing by NAI, Co-Host will submit each           advertisement and promotion to NAI for trademark review and approval           prior to initial release, which approval will not be unreasonably           delayed or withheld. All such usage which was not expressly approved           by NAI must be terminated immediately upon receipt of notice from NAI           to that effect.\n\n  (c)  Trademarks Rights. NAI owns any and all trademarks, trade names, and           service marks for the Products (as noted in Section 5 of the           Co-Hosting Agreement). Such trademarks, trade names, and service marks           shall include all product names, the names \"Network Associates,\"           logos, designs, and other designations or brands used by NAI in           connection with the Products. Co-Host acknowledges and agrees that NAI           is not granting to Co-Host any rights in any Product trademark, trade           name, or service mark in or outside of the Territory.\n\n4.   INSPECTIONS, RECORDS AND REPORTING.\n\n  (a)  Sales Out Reports. Co-Host will provide to NAI within ten (10) days           after the end of each calendar month, a computer media data file in           the format established by NAI showing, for such month, Co-Host's total           sales, by customer and by Product from each location. If requested by           NAI, Co-Host shall provide such reports with respect to weekly periods           or bi-weekly periods prior to the end of the calendar month in which           such period occurs.\n\n  (b)  Inventory Level Reports. Co-Host will provide to NAI on Monday of each           week, a computer media data file in the format established by NAI           showing Co-Host's current inventory levels of each Product (including           items in transit), and weekly runrate snapshots and the other           information reasonably requested by NAI.\n\n  (c)  Records. For three (3) years after each calendar quarter during the           term of this Agreement, Co-Host will keep, at Co-Host's office, full           and accurate books of account and copies of all documents and other           materials for such quarter relating to this Agreement and Co-Host's           records, accounts and contracts relating to the distribution of the           Products.\n\n                                    3    18\n\n  (d)  Audit. NAI may inspect the records described in Sections 4(c) upon           demand from time to time. In addition, Co-Host agrees to allow NAI's           independent auditors to audit and analyze appropriate accounting           records of Co-Host from time to time (but not more than one every six           (6) months) to ensure compliance with all terms of this Agreement. Any           such audit shall be permitted by Co-Host within fifteen (15) days of           Co-Host's receipt of NAI's written request to audit, during normal           business hours. The cost of such an audit will be borne by NAI unless           a material discrepancy indicating inadequate record keeping or that           additional fees due to NAI are discovered, in which case the cost of           the audit shall be borne by Co-Host. A discrepancy shall be deemed           material if it involves payment or adjustment of more than five           percent of the amount reported in favor of NAI. Audits and inspections           shall not interfere unreasonably with Co-Host's business activities.]\n\n5.   ORDERING AND PAYMENT.\n\n  (a)  NAI's Acceptance. Any order for delivery of physical product placed\n\n\n\n\n\n       with NAI is subject to acceptance by NAI within ten (10) days           following receipt by NAI. NAI may decline any order, in whole or in           part, and unless NAI accepts an order in writing, the order is           considered accepted only to the extent it is fulfilled.] The terms and           conditions of this Agreement and of the applicable NAI invoice or           confirmation will apply to each order accepted or shipped by NAI.           Electronic confirmation from an authorized NAI email address shall           have the same effect as a signed written confirmation. The provisions           of Co-Host's form of purchase order or other business forms will not           apply to any order notwithstanding NAI's acknowledgment or acceptance           of such order.\n\n  (b)  Price to Co-Host. NAI will inform Co-Host as to its current suggested           retail price of the Products and standard discount or pricing granted           to NAI's traditional product distributors. During the term of this           Agreement, Co-Host will be invoiced on the basis of the discounts set           forth on Exhibit \"A\" of this Distribution Addendum. Discounts off           suggested retail price (SRP) for standard NAI Products shall exclude           tradeups, upgrade SKUs and special promotions, unless otherwise           indicated. NAI may change its SRP from time to time upon written           notice to Co-Host, which may take the form of a revised price list,           and NAI may notify Co-Host of a different discount from SRP in the           event NAI offers special promotional SRPs or Product prices in NAI's           discretion.\n\n  (c)  Price Increase. If NAI increases its suggested retail price for any           Product (a product upgrade with a different part number will not be           the same Product) and there is a resulting increase in the price of           Products to Co-Host, NAI will give Co-Host thirty (30) days advance           notice of the effective date of any such increase and:\n\n       (i)  NAI will honor the old price for any shipments of such Product                already in transit to Co-Host;\n\n                                    4    19\n\n       (ii) All additional orders following such thirty (30) day period will                be shipped at the new price;\n\n      (iii) NAI has orders for such Product from Co-Host already booked into                NAI's order entry system at the time of such price increase or if                Co-Host orders additional Products during such thirty (30) day                period, then the price increase will not apply to that portion of                such orders which call for shipments of not more than the monthly                average quantity of such Products shipped to Co-Host in the three                month period preceding the date of the increase; and\n\n       (iv) Orders for such Product in NAI's order entry system in excess of                the quantity specified in (iii) above will be shipped at the new                price unless they are canceled by Co-Host by written notice to                NAI, provided that such notice is received by NAI no later than                fifteen (15) days prior to the date of shipment specified in such                order.\n\n  (d)  Price Decrease. If NAI decreases its suggested retail price for any           Product (a product upgrade with a different part number will not be           the same Product), the decrease will apply to all units of such           Product in Co-Host's inventory and orders in transit to Co-Host from           NAI that are in an unopened, salable condition as of the effective           date of the decrease, provided that such Products had been shipped to           Co-Host no more than ninety (90) days prior to such effective date. To           be eligible for such price protection, Co-Host must deliver to NAI           written evidence, signed by Co-Host, of an inventory of such Products           showing the number and location of each unit of Product for which           Co-Host claims price protection eligibility hereunder within thirty           (30) days of receiving notice of such price decreases. Such reduction           will constitute a credit on Co-Host's account for future orders from           NAI under this Agreement (unless the Agreement has terminated or           expired in which case such reduction will be refunded to the extent           that Co-Host does not owe NAI money) in an amount equal to the           difference between the net invoice price at which each such unit in           inventory was provided to Co-Host and the current price then           applicable for shipments of such Product to Co-Host hereunder.\n\n  (e)  TAXES.\n\n       (i)  All amounts payable by Co-Host to NAI under this Agreement are                exclusive of any tax, withholding tax, levy, or similar                governmental charge that may be assessed by any jurisdiction in                or outside the Territory except income and similar taxes levied                on and payable by NAI. Such taxes, withholding taxes, levies, and                governmental charges (collectively \"Taxes\") include Taxes based                on sales, use, excise, import or export values/fees, value-added,                income, revenue, net worth, or may be the result of the delivery,                possession, or use of the Products, the execution or performance                of this Agreement or otherwise. Should any Taxes be due, Co-Host                agrees to pay such Taxes and indemnify NAI for any claim for\n\n                                    5    20\n\n\n\n\n\n            such Taxes demanded. Co-Host shall make no deduction from any                amounts owed to NAI for any Taxes. Co-Host covenants to NAI that                all Products distributed hereunder will be in the ordinary course                of Co-Host's business, and Co-Host agrees to provide NAI with                appropriate information and/or documentation satisfactory to the                applicable taxing authorities to substantiate any claim of                exemption from any Taxes.\n\n       (ii) For all Taxes paid by Co-Host, Co-Host shall provide to NAI                within forty-five (45) days after the end of any quarter, a                certificate of tax payment documenting the payment and amount of                the Taxes paid during the preceding quarter.\n\n6.

PURPOSE OF APPLICATION SYSTEM. To create a new iOS / Android Native app and a web responsive site to allow users to connect with each other inside a unique social betting platform. The Platform is social trivia, initially sports trivia and other trivia contests leading to peer to peer betting intended for the causal and non- professional betting market. A landing page to promote the product is included as well for desktop and mobile devices. Developer will publish the app in Apple Store / Google Play Store with developer accounts registered to the client. The responsive website will be uploaded and deployed into an AWS Environment also registered to the client. The applications and responsive website will be fed by a Ruby on Rails backend with the according API. The API will be open to be used in other sports betting platforms. The app will be developed under the following considerations: \u25cf Native iOS Swift 5.0 Language with Xcode Development Environment. \u25cf Native JAVA with Android Studio for Android Devices with OS 6.0+ \u25cf Ruby On Rails Backend + PostgreSQL + Rest API \u25cf HTML5 + CSS 3 + Bootstrap Core Platform The Core of Click Stream is a free to play gaming platform that caters untapped market of the causal users that will spend a few seconds to interact with a platform for free in order to win real money. Our primary target is not the sports betters or the fantasy players. We target a more general demographic that is much more general and includes more of the female population. Our games will initially be quick to play quiz type games that allows the user to get involved in around 20 seconds, and then receive results from push notifications. Game types are set up dynamically with live game shows with Hosts 2 - 4 times per month. Because the format doesn't change, we can run games nightly for NBA to NHL, NFL to individual events such as the Oscars, other awards shows, and new sporting events such as Soccer and Nascar. Games and events automated from the backend and launched automatically. Api's Are plugged in to track results in real time, and there is a manual option to allow customs events that can be run through the platform. Business model- What sets our platform apart from other platforms in this untapped casual industry is that we have winners win significant amounts of money via time breakers, timing of inputting answers etc. Competitor platforms pay out an average of a few dollars. Our winners are more top loaded and pay out around $2,500 per the top 5 and $1,000 per the top 10. Initially monetization is based upon sponsors paying out the pots. IE, a pot for a single game will be around $25,000 to the winners and Sponsors will pay around $30,000 to $35,000 to sponsor the event. In return they will get around 30,000-75,000 unique user hits and eyeballs to their product/company.\n\n8 \u2502 Page\n\nSource: CLICKSTREAM CORP, 1-A, 3/30/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nEventually the platform will expand into affiliate sales of products and once the audience has grown large enough, peer to peer betting. Monetization We will initially fund the first month of pots in order to attract enough users to get sponsors. After the first month we will have enough users to begin having sponsors pay the pots. We will then expand to peer to peer betting and advertising. B. SERVICES. The Developer will develop the mobile application based on the Client's specifications, will assist the Client in acquiring corporate sponsors and will operate and maintain the Application System through hosting of games including customer support.

DISTRIBUTOR is not authorized to make warranties or          representations on behalf of PPG SHANGHAI and shall make no such          warranties or representations. THESE ARE THE ONLY REPRESENTATIONS OR          WARRANTIES THAT PPG SHANGHAI MAKES, AND ALL OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED          WARRANTIES UNDER STATUTE OR ARISING OTHERWISE IN LAW FROM A COURSE OF          DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY          OF MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE, ARE          DISCLAIMED BY PPG SHANGHAI. In the event that the Product fails to          conform to the warranties herein given, DISTRIBUTOR's exclusive remedy          and PPG SHANGHAI's sole responsibility is, at PPG SHANGHAI's option,          limited to the replacement of such nonconforming Product at PPG          SHANGHAI's expense or the refund of the purchase price attributable to          a specific delivery as to which a claim is made. For the avoidance of          doubt, PPG SHANGHAI hereby declares and represents that PPG SHANGHAI is          not responsible for any damage to the Products after they have been          taken away from PPG SHANGHAI's warehouse and caused by DISTRIBUTOR or          its transport agent.\n\n11.2     It is PPG SHANGHAI's responsibility to ensure that mis-delivery of          Product is kept to the minimum. DISTRIBUTOR shall inspect the Products          within 48 hours upon delivery. In case of discrepancy found in Products\n\n\n\n\n\n         delivered, DISTRIBUTOR shall report to PPG SHANGHAI in writing,          detailing all the discrepancies within 48 hours after delivery. PPG          SHANGHAI will not accept any claims for discrepancy in delivery beyond          the 48 hours period. If Products are found damaged upon delivery,          DISTRIBUTOR or its customers who directly receive the delivery shall          report to PPG SHANGHAI in writing within 48 hours. The necessary and          sufficient evidence (and photos) required for insurance claim must be          submitted altogether. None of the damaged Products shall be disposed of          until the claim is settled by the insurance company or PPG SHANGHAI.\n\n11.3     DISTRIBUTOR assumes all responsibility, risk and liability arising from          (i) the unloading, discharge, storage, handling and use of the          Products, including use thereof alone or in combination with other          substances; (ii) the improper functioning or failure of unloading,          discharge, transportation or storage systems equipment used by          DISTRIBUTOR, whether furnished or recommended by PPG SHANGHAI or not;          and (iii) the failure to comply with laws, rules and regulations          governing unloading, discharge, storage, handling and use of the          Products.\n\n12.      FORCE MAJEURE\n\nPPG SHANGHAI's failure or inability to make, or DISTRIBUTOR's failure or inability to take, any delivery or deliveries when due, or the failure or inability of either party to effect timely performance of any other obligation required of it hereunder, if caused by \"force majeure\" as hereinafter defined, shall not constitute a default hereunder or subject the party affected by force majeure to any liability to the other; provided, however, that the party so affected shall promptly notify the other of the existence thereof and of its expected duration and the estimated effect thereof upon its ability to perform its obligations hereunder. Such party shall promptly notify the other party when such force majeure circumstance has ceased to affect its ability to perform its obligations hereunder. The quantity to be delivered hereunder shall be reduced to the extent of the deliveries omitted for such cause or causes, unless both parties agree that the total quantity to be delivered hereunder shall remain unchanged. For so long as its ability to perform hereunder is affected by such force majeure circumstance, PPG SHANGHAI may, at its option, elect to allocate its total production of Product among its various requirements therefor (e.g., manufacturing and sales) in such manner as PPG SHANGHAI deems practicable and which, in the opinion of PPG SHANGHAI, is fair and reasonable. During the time that PPG SHANGHAI is unable to make deliveries or otherwise perform, it shall not be obligated to procure, or to use its best efforts to procure, any quantity of Product sold hereunder from any alternate producer or supplier.

LIMITATION OF DAMAGES\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, on the termination of this Agreement for any cause whatsoever, DISTRIBUTOR shall not be entitled to claim or receive from PPG SHANGHAI any compensation, reimbursement, or damages on account of any expenditure or commitment of any kind in connection with its business or on account of goodwill or on account of loss of prospective profits or otherwise.

As used in this Section, the term                   \"government official\" means any officer or employee of any                   government or any department, agency, instrumentality or                   wholly-owned corporation thereof, or any person acting in an                   official capacity for or on behalf of any such government or                   department, agency, instrumentality or wholly-owned                   corporation thereof, or any candidate for political office.\n\n17.2     DISTRIBUTOR agrees to notify PPG SHANGHAI immediately of any          solicitation, demand or other request for anything of value, by or on          behalf of any employee of a customer, government official or employee          of any government which is directed to itself or to PPG SHANGHAI          related to the sale and/or service of the Products.\n\n17.3     DISTRIBUTOR agrees to require any sub-distributor or other person which          it hires or engages to assist in the performance of this Agreement to          comply with the provisions of this Section 17.\n\n18.

Confidential Information.\n\n(a) \"Confidential Information\" means any information, materials or methods in whatever form or embodiment that has not been made available by Aduro to the general public and any information, materials or methods in the possession or control of Consultant on the Effective Date or developed in the performance of the Services, except that Confidential Information shall not include any information, material or method that (i) at the time of disclosure is in, or after disclosure becomes part of the public domain, through no improper act on the part of Consultant or any of its employees; (ii) was in Consultant's possession at the time of disclosure, as shown by written evidence, and was not acquired, directly or indirectly, from work with Aduro; or (iii) Consultant receives from a third party, provided that such Confidential Information was not obtained by such third party, directly or indirectly, from Aduro.\n\nSpecific information disclosed as part of the Confidential Information shall not be deemed to be in the public domain or in the prior possession of Consultant merely because it is encompassed or contemplated by more general information in the public domain or in the prior possession of the Consultant. Failure to mark any of the Confidential Information as confidential or proprietary shall not affect its status as Confidential Information under the terms of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Consultant shall keep all Confidential Information confidential, and Consultant shall not disclose, disseminate, publish, reproduce or use Confidential Information except to perform the Services. If Consultant is required by judicial or administrative process to disclose Confidential Information, Consultant shall promptly notify Aduro to allow Aduro a reasonable time to oppose such process and Consultant shall reasonably cooperate in Aduro's efforts.\n\n(c) On Aduro's request, or upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement, Consultant shall immediately: (i) stop using Confidential Information; (ii) return all materials provided by Aduro to Consultant that contain Confidential Information, except for one copy that may be retained by Consultant's legal counsel to confirm compliance with the obligations under this Agreement; (iii) destroy all copies of Confidential Information in any form including Confidential Information contained in computer memory or data storage apparatus or materials prepared by or for Consultant; and (iv) provide a written warranty to Aduro that Consultant has taken all the actions described in the foregoing Subparagraphs 4(c)(i-iii).\n\n(d) Any breach of this Paragraph 4 by an employee or agent of Consultant shall be deemed to be a breach by Consultant.\n\n(e) Defend Trade Secrets Act Notice: Nothing herein shall prevent Consultant from reporting possible violations of federal or state law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity, or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal or state law or regulation. Consultant does not need the prior authorization of Aduro to make any such reports or disclosures and is not required to notify Aduro that it has made such reports or disclosures. In addition, as set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a71833(b), Consultant shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made in confidence to a federal, state or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, and that is made solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law, or that is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding if such filing is made under seal.\n\n5.

Consultant shall promptly disclose to Aduro all information relating to Work Product as appropriate as part of the Services and at the request of Aduro. To the extent, if any, that Consultant has rights in or to any Work Product or any data or inventions developed in connection with work under this Agreement (\"Aduro IP\"), Consultant hereby irrevocably assigns and transfers to Aduro, and to the extent that an executory assignment is not enforceable, Consultant hereby agrees to assign and transfer to Aduro, in writing, from time to time, upon request, any and all right, title, or interest that Consultant has or may obtain in any Work Product and/or Aduro IP without the necessity of further consideration. Aduro shall be entitled to obtain and hold in its own name all copyrights, patents, trade secrets and trademarks with respect thereto. At Aduro's request and expense, Consultant shall assist Aduro in acquiring and maintaining its right in and title to, any Work Product. Such assistance may include, but will not be limited to, signing applications and other documents, cooperating in legal proceedings, and taking any other steps considered necessary or desirable by Aduro.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Nonsolicitation. From the Effective Date and for twelve (12) months after the termination of this Agreement (the \"Restricted Period\"), Consultant shall not, without Aduro's prior written consent, directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage any employee or contractor of Aduro or its affiliates to terminate employment with, or cease providing Services to, Aduro or its affiliates. In the event of a breach of this Paragraph 7 by Consultant, Aduro shall be entitled to entry of injunctive relief. Such injunctive remedy shall be nonexclusive and shall be in addition to any and all other remedies which may be available to it at law or in equity, including without limitation, the recovery of direct, indirect, incidental, consequential and/or punitive damages.\n\n8. Representations. Consultant represents as follows:\n\n(a) Consultant is not subject to any other agreement that Consultant will violate by signing this Agreement;\n\n(b) Consultant has and shall continue to have the knowledge, experience, qualifications and required skill to perform, and shall perform, the Services in a professional manner;\n\n(c) Consultant to perform the Services in accordance with all Applicable Law; and\n\n(d) During the term of this Agreement, Consultant will not, directly or indirectly (whether for compensation or without compensation) engage in or provide consulting services, or enter into any agreement either written or oral, that would present a material conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement, or would preclude Consultant from complying with the terms and conditions hereof. If during the term of this Agreement any situation or circumstance arises that might reasonably be expected to present a conflict of interest, or if Consultant might be unable to render Services or otherwise participate in such work without risk of breaching an obligation of confidentiality to another party, Consultant will promptly advise the Company's General Counsel of the situation and Company and Consultant shall, in good faith, attempt to resolve any such conflicts(s). If requested by the Company's General Counsel, Consultant will recuse herself from providing Services for the duration of the conflict.\n\n9. Material Non-Public Information. Consultant may have access to, or learn, \"material non-public information\" about Aduro or companies working with Aduro during the course of performing Services under this Agreement. Consultant acknowledges that it is illegal to buy or sell Aduro's stock or the stock of companies working with Aduro, on the basis of \"material non-public information.\" It is also illegal to pass such information on to others who use it to buy or sell Aduro stock. Consultant is subject to and will comply with Aduro's Insider Trading and Trading Window Policy.\n\n10. Miscellaneous. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflict of law principles of California or any other jurisdiction. This Agreement contains the entire agreement and understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and merges and supersedes all prior discussions, agreements and understandings of every nature between them with respect to the subject matter hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement does not supersede or in modify in anyway any other written agreement between the parties. This Agreement may not be changed or modified, except by an agreement in writing signed by both of the parties hereto. The obligations of Consultant as set forth herein, other than Consultant's obligations to perform the Project, shall survive the termination of Consultant's engagement with Aduro. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain effective and enforceable to the greatest extent permitted by law. This Agreement shall not be assignable by Consultant.

Dispute Resolution. (a) Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof (each, a \"Dispute\"), shall to the extent possible be settled through friendly consultation among the Parties hereto.

Specific Performance. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms and that any breach of this Agreement could not be adequately compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone.

WLI reserves the right to add additional products and to delete obsolete or superseded products at any time during the term of this Agreement upon sixty (60) days prior written notice to Power2Ship.\n\n1.2. G3001 GPSLink is a fully functional device including GPS receiver with an integrated CDPD or GPRS modem including 4 dry contact alarm inputs and one contact output and a DB9 connector for serial connection to a PDA. When integrated with MidLink middleware the G3001 can integrate to any third party software application subject to specifications published from time to time by WLI and available for download from the WLI web site.\n\n1.3. The Products and Licensed Programs shall be sold by Power2Ship to its customers pursuant to WLI's standard warranty and software license agreements.\n\n1.4. Power2Ship may, at any time during the term of this Agreement, assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more of its subsidiaries in which it owns at least 50.1% of the actual equity of the subsidiary on a fully diluted basis and as long as Power2Ship remains the guarantor for the payments and terms and conditions of this Agreement (individually, a \"Subsidiary\"). Each Subsidiary shall thereafter have the rights and obligations of Power2Ship hereunder with respect to all terms and conditions of this agreement as if such Subsidiary had entered into this Agreement directly with WLI.\n\n1.5. If Power2Ship merges with another company and/or changes its name, this Agreement will survive the merger and/or name change and the new entity will assume all the rights and obligations of Power2Ship pursuant to this Agreement.\n\n1.6. WLI may, at any time during the term of this Agreement, assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any subsidiary in which it owns at least 50.1% of the equity on a fully diluted basis.\n\n1.7. Power2Ship acknowledges that it has already integrated the G3001 packaged with the MidLink middleware into its application tested it and found it to meet its requirements.\n\n2. TERM\n\n2.1. Unless otherwise terminated as provided herein, the initial term of this Agreement shall be three (3) years from the Effective Date and shall thereafter be automatically renewed for subsequent one (1) year periods unless either party notifies the other in writing of its election not to renew the Agreement at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the expiration of the then-current term. Should this Agreement be terminated by either party for any reason, the obligations of the parties to each other as set forth herein will survive any termination.\n\n3. PRICES\n\n3.1. Subject to Section 3.6 below the price of the Product, excluding the Licensed Programs, is $[*] per Unit. The total price for both of the Licensed Programs together is $[*] per month per Product (\"License Fee\"). The License Fee shall begin on the date the Product is shipped to a customer and shall be paid by Power2Ship to WLI by the 7th of each month for the prior month (prorated if the Unit was shipped during the prior month) and shall continue for as long as the Product is active on any wireless network. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Power2Ship is obligated to pay the License Fee to WLI for a minimum of 36 months.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2. Once the monthly License Fee for a particular Unit has started, it will continue for a minimum of 36 consecutive months with the only exception being that should Power2Ship uninstall a particular Unit from one customer and install it at another customer, Power2Ship is permitted to suspend the monthly License Fee for that particular Unit for a maximum of 2 months during the life of this Agreement. This suspension of the License Fee is permitted only once per a particular Unit during the life of the Agreement (i.e., the suspension can't occur in two non-consecutive months). Units that are suspended for less than thirty consecutive days are not considered suspended.\n\n3.3. Once Power2Ship has paid WLI the License Fee for a minimum of 36 months for a particular Unit, Power2Ship may discontinue paying the month License Fee only if that particular Unit has been deactivated from the wireless network. If a Unit is deactivated after 36 months and subsequently is reactivated, Power2Ship must restart the payment of the License Fee for as long as that particular Unit remains active on the wireless network.\n\n3.4. The $[*] hardware price per Unit is based on a single order of a minimum of 1000 Units and manufacturing of a minimum 500 Units. At the time of placing the order with WLI, Power2Ship must pay the full purchase price of $[*] per Unit. The delivery time is 8-10 weeks starting with the date the payment is received by WLI.\n\n--------      ------- RH            JS                                                       6/7/2002                                    Page 1 of 9\n\n3.5. To shorten the delivery time to 3-4 weeks, Power2Ship has the option to purchase all the key components for $[*] per Unit and have them stored at no charge by WLI on behalf of Power2Ship so they can be available for immediate manufacturing when Power2Ship places an order. If this option is exercised, when Power2ship places an order to authorize Units to be manufactured it will pay with the $[*] balance per Unit at the time of such order.\n\n3.6. Power2ship has the option to order Units in lower quantities at higher Unit prices as follows: 100 to 299 Unit at $[*]; 300 to 499 Units at $[*] and; 500 to 999 Units at $[*]. The only exception to this will be the first order of 100 Units at a Unit price of $[*] if the order is placed no later than April 4, 2003.\n\n3.7. The Unit prices and monthly License Fees of $[*] can't be increased by WLI under the terms of this Agreement.\n\n3.8. Unless otherwise stated in writing by WLI, all prices quoted shall be exclusive of state and local use, sales and property taxes. Power2Ship agrees to be responsible for any such taxes incurred as a result of its purchase of Products from WLI, unless Power2Ship shall have presented WLI with an exemption certificate.\n\n3.9. Power2Ship may purchase dual antennas with a \" screw for the Units from WLI at the following unit prices: $[*] when purchased in quantities of 100 to 499; $[*] when purchased in quantities of 500 to 999 and; $[*] when purchased in quantities of 1000 or more. Terms of payment for the antennas are [*]% upon placing the order with WLI and the balance when the antennas are ready to be shipped to Power2Ship. A lead time of at least four weeks is required for delivery.\n\n3.10. Power2Ship will pay WLI 10% of any activation commissions (\"Unit Commissions\"), if any, it receives as a result of any Unit activated on a specific wireless network. The payment will be paid on the 7th of every month for any Unit Commissions received by Power2Ship during the previous month. Power2Ship will provide with the payment a report of the total number of activations during the month and the amount received per activation.\n\n3.11. All prices are FOB WLI offices in NJ.\n\n4.

Power2Ship shall devote its best efforts to ensure that all Power2Ship's personnel and all other persons afforded access to the Licensed Programs by Power2Ship protect the Licensed Programs as trade secrets and confidential information and refrain from any use or disclosure in any manner not expressly permitted by this Agreement. These restrictions shall not apply to information (1) generally known to the public or obtainable from public sources; (2) readily apparent from the keyboard operation, visual display, or output reports of the Licensed Programs; (3) previously in the possession of Power2Ship or subsequently developed or acquired without reliance on the Licensed Programs; or (4) approved by WLI for release without restriction.\n\n4.5.

When Products are ordered for the GPRS network, Power2Ship must provide one SIM card for every Unit ordered within a maximum of two weeks from the date of order. The Sim Cards have to be placed and tested in the Unit as they are being manufactured at the factory.

The report must be sent even if there is no activity during the prior week.\n\n5.9. Power2Ship must provide WLI with a complete copy of its monthly airtime bill for the Units as received by the respective wireless operators (T-Mobile, Verizon, AT&T, etc.). Power2Ship is required to keep all the WLI Unit activations on every wireless network on a separate account from any other vendor's brand used by Power2Ship. Every such monthly invoice (one per operator) must be submitted to WLI within 7 days from the date it is received by Power2Ship and the invoice must include all pages listed on the invoice (example 7of 7 pages). Power2Ship's Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n\nmust confirm in writing to WLI every quarter that the account numbers under which the WLI Units are being activated on the various networks are the only accounts under which the WLI units are activated.\n\n6. DELIVERY, TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS\n\n6.1. Delivery shall be F.O.B. WLI's facility in Lyndhurst, New Jersey. WLI shall use its reasonable efforts to deliver Products to Power2Ship on the date of delivery specified by Power2Ship. WLI will use its reasonable efforts to notify Power2Ship of any delays in scheduled delivery dates.\n\n6.2. Title to the Products and the risk of loss or damage shall pass to Power2Ship upon delivery of the Products to Power2Ship or its shipping company of choice. In the event of any loss of or damage to the Products following delivery to the carrier, WLI shall, upon request, cooperate with Power2Ship in connection with the proof of loss claim presented by Power2Ship to the carrier and/or insurer.\n\n6.3. Power2Ship shall bear the entire risk of loss or damage to the Units and any other equipment purchased from WLI (collectively the \"Equipment\") after installation of the Equipment in the customers' vehicles. The occurrence of any such loss or damage shall not permit Power2Ship to delay or reduce the payment of any fees prescribed under this agreement unless Power2Ship presents WLI with proof of a claim to an insurance company and, in such case, Power2Ship should replace the lost or damaged Equipment within a maximum of 60 days and resume the payment of monthly License Fees to WLI. Power2Ship is advised to obtain and maintain property and casualty insurance for the Equipment against all risks of loss or damage. The amount of such insurance shall not be less than the replacement cost of the Equipment.\n\n6.4. Power2Ship is responsible for maintaining and storing in a safe and secure location backup copies of all data files Power2Ship may place in the System. In no event shall WLI be liable for loss or destruction of Power2Ship's data files for any reason.\n\n7. PAYMENT\n\n7.1.

The renewal of the limited warranty after the first year is at the option of the customer, but in any case, Unit failure does not relieve Power2Ship of its obligation to pay the monthly License Fees to WLI for that Unit. The first year limited warranty starts on the day of the activation of the Unit on a wireless network. As a distributor, Power2Ship should keep a minimum number of Units in stock for immediate replacement for its customers.\n\n7.5. This Agreement is separate and apart from the contract between Power2Ship and its customer. Failure of the customer to pay Power2Ship, for whatever reason, does not affect the obligation of Power2Ship to pay its contractual obligations to WLI.\n\n7.6. If an invoice is past due by more than 30 days, WLI may discontinue providing technical support to Power2Ship until the invoice is paid. If Power2Ship does not make payment of any amount due and payable hereunder within 60 days of the date of invoice, WLI (without prejudice to any other remedy) shall be entitled to interest on all past due amounts at the lower of eighteen percent (18%) per annum or the highest rate permitted by law, plus reimbursement of all costs incurred in collecting such amounts, including court costs and reasonable attorney fees.\n\n8.

Said examination shall be at WLI's sole cost and expense during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, and may not be conducted more than once annually; provided, however,                                                           --------  ------- that if such audit reveals an underpayment by Power2Ship of more than 10% for the period audited, Power2Ship shall pay WLI's actual costs and expenses for performing such audit.\n\n8.2. WLI, at its own discretion, may visit Power2Ship's warehouse at normal business hours to verify the actual number of Units in inventory and/or the number of Units suspended.\n\n--------      ------- RH            JS                                                          Page 3\n\n8.3.

Power2Ship will receive the first customer call and will have to maintain a minimum inventory level of spare Units to service its customers within 48 hours. WLI will support an end-user only upon Power2Ship's request and only after Power2Ship has tried to provide the support and has failed to fix the problem. WLI will not be involved in any end-user training.\n\n10.4. Power2Ship will maintain a minimum level of inventory of the Product for service purposes, which the parties estimate to be 1% of the aggregate number of Units active on any wireless network at any given time.\n\n11. WARRANTY AND INDEMNIFICATION\n\n11.1. WLI warrants the Products pursuant to the terms of its hardware limited warranty and limited software warranty set forth in Exhibit B hereto.

Power2Ship shall be reimbursed for any actual loss, liability or damage suffered or incurred by Power2Ship and for all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Power2Ship in connection with any action, suit, proceeding, demand, assessment or judgment incident to any of the matters indemnified against in this provision provided that Power2Ship immediately notifies WLI as to the institution of such suit, gives or obtains for WLI such authority as may be necessary for WLI to defend same, and supplies WLI such further information and assistance for the defense thereof as WLI may reasonably require and request. WLI shall have no obligation under this section, and shall have no liability to Power2Ship, if such claim arises due to the alteration or modification of any Product without the prior written consent of WLI.\n\n11.4. Power2Ship shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless WLI from all liability and claims whatsoever for any injury to persons or property or for any loss, expense, or damage incurred by any of Power2Ship's personnel or invitees or by any other person or party (except agents or employees of WLI) arising as a result of or in connection with Power2Ship's acquisition or use of the Products and Licensed Programs or WLI 's performance of its obligations or exercise of its rights hereunder except for those claims which are the result of the willful acts or gross negligence of WLI.\n\n12.

Theravance will provide two (2) Theravance New Compounds to the collaboration within eighteen (18) months of the Effective Date in order to meet the requirement that Theravance contribute a total of four (4) LABA compounds to the Pooled Compounds. Without prejudice to the foregoing, GSK will endeavor to provide Theravance, upon Theravance's request and at GSK's expense and discretion, such assistance as may be reasonably required by Theravance to achieve this objective, including providing directly or through GSK's vendors, assistance in (i) chemical process development, (ii) salt selection, (iii) pharmaceutical formulation, (iv) toxicological evaluation, and (v) API preparation.   4.2 Obligations for Development.   4.2.1 General; GSK. Under the direction of the Joint Project Committee, specific Pooled Compounds will be identified from time to time and, as applicable, selected for Development as a Collaboration Product. The Joint Project Committee will determine the number and extent of Development of the Pooled Compounds and the criteria to be used for selecting among the eight Pooled Compounds and, subject to the other terms of this Agreement, will endeavor to move one or more such Collaboration Products forward in Development. In   17\n\n\n\n\n\n  relation to the foregoing, GSK shall have the overall responsibility for, and use Diligent Efforts in, the performance of all such Development activities which shall include, where applicable, relevant regulatory filings (as contemplated under Article 8) for any such Collaboration Product moved forward in Development. Further, GSK shall use Diligent Efforts to advance such Collaboration Product through Development in accordance with the Go/No-Go checkpoints identified in the then current Development Plan for such Collaboration Product. GSK shall also use Diligent Efforts to contribute at least one ICS and/or other non-LABA compound to the collaboration for the purpose of developing a combination product and Diligent Efforts to develop an optimal inhaled formulation of Collaboration Product in a device which may be either/or a dry powder inhaler formulation and/or a metered dose inhaler formulation of the Collaboration Compound and Development activities of such may continue in parallel.   4.2.2 GSK Funding Responsibility. GSK shall bear all costs and expenses associated with the Development of Collaboration Products for Commercialization including those incurred by Theravance (or to which it has become obligated) after the signature date of this Agreement and which previously have been discussed with and agreed to by GSK and, so far as the aforementioned Theravance costs are concerned, for the avoidance of doubt, the maximum amount shall not exceed U.S. $2,940,000.   4.2.3 Decisions with Respect to Products.   (a) GSK shall have the sole discretion with respect to Development decisions for Collaboration Products subject to and in accordance with Sections 3.1.5, 3.2.5, and 4.3 .   (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge that Theravance is about to initiate a Phase I Study in two parts, on TD-3327. The initiation of this study will be approved via the Joint Project Committee in accordance with all other Development activities.

(c) GSK shall provide the Joint Project Committee with an update report within thirty days of (i) the initiation (i.e., first person dosed) of any Study involving a Collaboration Product, and (ii) the last person dosed/last visit in any Study relating to a Collaboration Product. GSK will provide the Joint Project Committee with a reasonably detailed \"top line results\" report within sixty days following the last person dosed/last visit in any Study involving a Collaboration Product.   4.2.4 Development Timelines. It is hereby acknowledged that GSK's strategic objective is to move one or more of the Collaboration Products into Development at the earliest opportunity. GSK will consult with the Joint Project Committee and will share, modify and further develop all applicable Development Plans and timelines in that forum. It is recognised that success can be optimised by pursuing a number of Collaboration Products through various phases of clinical Development up to the point of Technical or Commercial Failure, and/or until the first Collaboration Product for both single agent and combination therapy achieves regulatory agency approval. At a strategic level, GSK is committed to this objective. However, at an operational level it is recognised that internal and external resources will be constrained from time to time, resulting in the need to prioritise individual studies and activities relating to Collaboration Products. GSK will use Diligent Efforts to secure the necessary resource and will keep the Joint Project Committee informed on the progress of individual studies and activities relating to Collaboration Products as part of any changes to Development Plans and timelines.   18\n\n\n\n\n\n  The current objective of the Collaboration is to achieve Marketing Authorization Approval in the US and other Major Markets for a Collaboration Product from one of the eight Pooled Compounds which can be used as a single agent and/or in combination with other therapeutically active components (including but not limited to a Long Acting Inhaled Corticosteroid) for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of one or more respiratory diseases by end 2009 for the single agent and 2010 for the first combination product and Development Plans and timelines will be developed and/or refined in an effort to achieve this objective.   4.3 Replacement Compounds.

ARTICLE 6 FINANCIAL PROVISIONS   6.1 Signing Payment; Equity Investment; One-Time Fee.   6.1.1 Signing Payment. In partial consideration for the acquisition of license rights under the Theravance Patents and the Theravance Know-How by GSK under this Agreement, GSK shall on the Effective Date, pay to Theravance a non-creditable, non-refundable amount of Ten Million United States Dollars (U.S. $10,000,000).   6.1.2 Stock Purchase. On the Effective Date, GSK will purchase 4,000,000 shares of Theravance Series E Preferred Stock at a price of U.S.$10.00 per share for total consideration of Forty Million United States Dollars (U.S. $40,000,000). Such purchase will be made pursuant to the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement attached hereto as Schedule 6.1.2.   6.1.3 One-Time Fee for AMI-15471. Within thirty days following receipt by GSK of Theravance's written notification of the decision by Theravance to nominate AMI-15471 as a \"development candidate,\" and in further partial consideration for the acquisition of license rights under the Theravance Patents and the Theravance Know-How by GSK under this Agreement, GSK shall pay to Theravance a non-creditable, non-refundable amount of Five Million United States Dollars (U.S.$5,000,000). AMI-15471 will be declared a development candidate when Theravance (a) completes a study demonstrating lack of activity in the hERG assay (as per the Criteria in Schedule 1.19), and (b) establishes AMI- 15471 in a stable crystalline form.   21\n\n\n\n\n\n  6.1.4 One-Time Fee for Each Theravance New Compound. Within thirty days following the acceptance by the Joint Project Committee or the Joint Steering Committee of each of the two Theravance New Compounds to be contributed to the collaboration pursuant to Section 4.1, and in further partial consideration for the acquisition of license rights under the Theravance Patents and the Theravance Know-How by GSK under this Agreement, GSK shall pay to Theravance a non-creditable, non-refundable amount of Five Million United States Dollars (U.S.$5,000,000) for each such Theravance New Compound.   6.2 Milestone Payments.   6.2.1 General. In further consideration of the covenants and agreements contained herein, the Parties shall also pay to each other the payments set forth below for each such Development milestone referred to therein (each, a \"Development Milestone\"); provided always that each such payment shall be made only one time for each Collaboration Product regardless of how many times such Development Milestones are achieved for such Collaboration Product, and no payment shall be owed for a Development Milestone which is not reached (except that, upon achievement of a Development Milestone for a particular Collaboration Product, any previous Development Milestone for that Collaboration Product for which payment was not made shall be deemed achieved and payment therefore shall be made); provided further that, in the event that more than one Development Milestone is achieved with respect to the same Collaboration Product at one time, then all applicable payments under Section 6.2 shall be made. For example, if TD-3327 as a single-agent Collaboration Product and a LABA/ICS Combination Product that contains TD- 3327 are approved in the same Marketing Authorization Approval, then in addition to the relevant milestone for the single-agent TD-3327 Collaboration Product, the relevant milestone for the LABA/ICS Combination Product shall be paid simultaneously. In the event of termination of development of a particular Collaboration Product and an alternative Collaboration Product replaces such Terminated Collaboration Product then milestone payments for such replacement compound shall not be paid in respect of milestones already achieved by the Terminated Collaboration Product. For example, if development of TD-3327 is terminated and TD-3327 is replaced by a another Collaboration Product which contains a Theravance compound, milestone payments for such replacement compound will only commence for milestones achieved that have not already been achieved by TD-3327.   6.2.2 GSK to Theravance. GSK shall make the following milestone payments to Theravance upon the achievement of the indicated Development Milestone for the first Collaboration Product in which the Long-Acting \u03b22 Adrenoceptor Agonist is a Theravance Compound, and for the first LABA/ICS Combination Product in which the Long-Acting \u03b22 Adrenoceptor Agonist is a Theravance Compound:            Milestone\n\n  Amount               Initiation of Phase I *\n\n  U.S.$10 Million   Initiation of Phase IIa**\n\n  U.S.$10 Million   Initiation of Phase IIb**\n\n  U.S.$5 Million               Initiation of Phase III\n\n  U.S.$25 Million     22\n\n\n\n\n\n                   Milestone\n\n  Amount               Registration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S.\n\n  U.S.$30 Million   Europe\n\n  U.S.$15 Million   Japan\n\n  U.S.$10 Million               Launch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S.\n\n  U.S.$30 Million   Europe\n\n  U.S.$15 Million   Japan\n\n  U.S.$10 Million               Annual Worldwide Net Sales over U.S.$500 Million for single agent Collaboration Product\n\n\n\nU.S.$10 Million per year for first five years for single agent Collaboration Product\n\n            Annual Worldwide Net Sales over U.S.$500 Million for LABA/ICS Combination Product\n\n\n\nU.S.$20 Million per year for first five years for LABA/ICS Combination Product\n\n\n\n* GSK will make a Phase I milestone payment for both TD-3327 and AMI-15471. The Phase I milestone for TD-3327 is defined as initiation of the methacholine challenge portion of the Phase I Study in normal volunteers and will trigger a payment of U.S. $10 Million. The Phase I milestone for AMI-15471 is defined as initiation of the first Phase I Study in normal volunteers and will trigger a payment of U.S. $10 Million.   **Phase IIa is defined as initiation of the first single dose study in patients where such study is statistically powered for efficacy based on FEV . Phase IIb is defined as initiation of the first four (4) week dosing, safety and efficacy study in patients.   Other Combination Products that contain a Long-Acting \u03b22 Adrenoceptor Agonist that is a Theravance Compound are not subject to milestone payments by GSK only if all milestone payments through launch have otherwise been made to Theravance from any Collaboration Product as both a single-agent and as a combination product. The Parties intend that if the collaboration is successful in launching at least two Collaboration Products that contain a Theravance Compound, Theravance be paid the applicable milestones through launch for two products.   If GSK, either individually or as a member of the Joint Steering Committee or Joint Project Committee, discontinues the Development of a single agent Collaboration Product that is a Theravance Compound for reasons other than Technical Failure, and such compound is the LABA in a LABA/ICS Combination Product or in an Other Combination Product, it will compensate Theravance for the unpaid milestone payments otherwise due to Theravance under Section 6.2.2 by adding the unpaid milestone amounts for such discontinued single agent product onto the corresponding milestone payments for the relevant Combination Product.   6.2.3 Theravance to GSK. Theravance shall make the following milestone payments to GSK upon the achievement of the indicated Development Milestone for the first Collaboration Product in which the Long-Acting \u03b22 Adrenoceptor Agonist is a GSK Compound   23\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n  and for the first LABA/ICS Combination Product in which the Long-Acting \u03b22 Adrenoceptor Agonist is a GSK Compound:                Milestone\n\n  Amount               Registration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS\n\n  U.S.$30 Million   Europe\n\n  U.S.$15 Million   Japan\n\n  U.S.$10 Million               Launch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS\n\n  U.S.$30 Million   Europe\n\n  U.S.$15 Million   Japan\n\n  U.S.$10 Million     Other Combination Products that contain a Long-Acting \u03b22 Adrenoceptor Agonist that is a GSK Compound are not subject to milestone payments by Theravance only if all milestone payments through launch have otherwise been made to GSK from any Collaboration Product as both a single-agent and as a combination product. The Parties intend that if the collaboration is successful in launching at least two Collaboration Products that contain a GSK Compound, GSK be paid the applicable milestones through launch for two products.   6.2.4 Notification and Payment. In the event a Party achieves a Development Milestone, such Party shall promptly, but in no event more than ten (10) days after the achievement of each such Development Milestone, notify the other Party in writing of the achievement of same. For all Development Milestones achieved, each Party shall promptly, but in no event more than thirty (30) days after notification of the achievement of each such Development Milestone, remit payment to the other Party for such Development Milestone.   6.3 Payment of Royalties on Net Sales.   6.3.1 Royalty on Single-Agent Collaboration Products and LABA/ICS Combination Products.   Within twenty (20) days after the end of each Calendar Quarter , GSK shall pay Theravance royalty payments based on Net Sales in such Calendar Quarter during the Term as follows:        On total Annual Worldwide Net Sales up to and including U.S. $3 Billion:\n\n  15   %                   On total Annual Worldwide Net Sales greater than U.S. $3 Billion:\n\n  5   %     it being understood that Net Sales of a single agent Collaboration Product will be combined with Net Sales of a LABA/ICS Combination Product for purposes of the foregoing royalty calculation.   The quarterly royalty payments made under this Section 6.3.1 may be based on estimated Net Sales. Within thirty (30) days after the end of each Calendar Quarter, GSK shall calculate the actual amount of Net Sales for the previous Calendar Quarter and either credit or debit the difference between such actual and projected amount on the succeeding Calendar Quarter's royalty payment to Theravance. As soon as practical following the end of each Calendar Month, but in no event later than the 10 business day of the following month, GSK will provide Theravance with an estimate of Net Sales for such Calendar Month.   24\n\nth\n\n\n\n\n\n  The royalties payable under this Section 6.3 shall be paid on a Country-by-Country basis from the date of first commercial sale of each Collaboration Product in a particular Country for the Term of the Collaboration.   6.3.2 Royalty Adjustment. The 15% royalty payable on the first U.S. $3 Billion of total annual worldwide Net Sales under this Section 6.3 shall be reduced to 12% if all of the following occur: (i) all Theravance Compounds are discontinued by the collaboration for Technical Failure; (ii) Theravance only contributes one Theravance New Compound to the collaboration within 18 months following the Effective Date; and (iii) the Collaboration Product upon which the royalty is payable contains a LABA that is one of the GSK Initially Pooled Compounds. The 15% royalty payable on the first U.S. $3 Billion of total annual worldwide Net Sales under this Section 6.3 shall be reduced to 10% if all of the following occur: (i) all Theravance Compounds are discontinued by the collaboration for Technical Failure; (ii) Theravance fails to contribute any Theravance New Compound to the collaboration within 18 months following the Effective Date; and (iii) the Collaboration Product upon which the royalty is payable contains a LABA that is one of the GSK Initially Pooled Compounds. Nothing in the foregoing shall affect other royalties owed under this Agreement.   6.3.3 Royalties on Other Collaboration Products Launched After the LABA/ICS Combination Product. For any Other Collaboration Product launched after the LABA/ICS Combination Product, GSK shall within twenty (20) days after the end of each Calendar Quarter, pay Theravance royalty payments based on Net Sales in such Calendar Quarter during the Term as follows:\n\nAnnual Net Sales\n\n\n\nPercentage Royalty\n\n                  Up to U.S.$750 Million\n\n  6.5   %                   Additional Net Sales up to U.S.$1.25 Billion\n\n  8.0   %                   Additional Net Sales up to U.S.$2.25 Billion\n\n  9.0   %                   Net Sales exceeding U.S.$2.25 Billion\n\n  10.0   %     For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that the royalty set forth in this Section 6.3.3 shall only be effective if GSK has launched and is selling a LABA/ICS Combination Product that is subject to the royalties under Section 6.3.1. If GSK is not selling a LABA/ICS Combination Product, then the royalty set forth in Section 6.3.1 shall apply to the first Other Combination Product launched by GSK, provided such Other Combination Product does not contain a product in-licensed by GSK; if such Other Combination Product contains a product in-licensed by GSK, then the royalty payable to Theravance will be reduced by 50% of any running royalties paid to a Third Party, provided that in no case will the royalty payable to Theravance be less than set forth in this Section 6.3.3.   25\n\n\n\n\n\n  6.4 Royalty Responsibilities; Net Sales Reports.   6.4.1 Payments to Third Parties.   (a) If, as a result of a settlement approved by both Parties or as a result of a final non-appealable judgment, GSK is required to pay any amounts to a Third Party directly because using or selling a Theravance Compound is found to infringe the rights of such Third Party, GSK shall deduct fifty percent (50%) of any such amount paid to such Third Party from the royalties otherwise due Theravance for the Collaboration Product containing such Theravance Compound, provided in no event shall such reduction reduce the royalties otherwise payable to Theravance during any Calendar Year by more than fifty percent (50%); provided, further, that any excess deduction shall be carried over into subsequent years of this Agreement until the full deduction is taken.   (b) GSK shall pay any amounts owed to a Third Party as a result of the use of GSK Patents or GSK Know-How with respect to sales of Collaboration Products and shall not deduct any of such amounts from the royalties due Theravance. The foregoing is subject to Section 6.3.3.   6.4.2 Net Sales Report. Within thirty (30) days after the end of each Calendar Quarter, GSK shall submit to Theravance a written report setting forth Net Sales in the Territory on a Country-by-Country and Collaboration Product-by-Collaboration Product basis during such Calendar Quarter, total royalty payments due Theravance, relevant market share data and any payments made to any Third Party pursuant to Section 6.4.1(a) (each a \"Net Sales Report\").   6.5 GAAP. All financial terms and standards defined or used in this Agreement for sales or activities occurring in the United States shall be governed by and determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied. Except as otherwise set forth herein, all financial terms and standards defined or used in this Agreement for sales or activities occurring outside the United States shall be governed by and determined in accordance with United Kingdom generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied.   6.6 Currencies. Monetary conversion from the currency of a foreign country in which Collaboration Product is sold into US Dollars shall be calculated in accordance with either (a) the methodology referred to in GSK's then current Corporate Finance Reporting Policy or (b) as otherwise may be mutually agreed by the Parties. The following summarizes GSK's current methodology applied in accordance with its current Corporate Finance Reporting System: the cumulative year-to-date Average Rates are calculated by determining the average of (i) the preceding 31st December Spot Rate plus (ii) the Closing Spot Rates of the relevant months to date using the exact figures provided by the Reuters 2000 download. (By way of example, the Average Rate for the five months from January, 2002 to May, 2002 would be computed by taking the sum of the Spot Rates for the preceding 31st December, 2001, plus the month-end Spot Rates for the five months to May, 2002, divided by six).   6.7 Manner of Payments. All sums due to either Party under this Section 6 shall be payable in United States Dollars by bank wire transfer in immediately available funds to such bank account(s) as each of GSK and Theravance shall designate. GSK shall notify Theravance as to the date and amount of any such wire transfer to Theravance at least five (5) Business Days prior to such transfer. Theravance shall notify GSK as to the date and amount of any such wire transfer to GSK at least five (5) Business Days prior to such transfer.   26\n\n\n\n\n\n  6.8 Interest on Late Payments. If either Theravance or GSK shall fail to make a timely payment pursuant to this Article 6, any such payment that is not paid on or before the date such payment is due under this Agreement shall bear interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law, at the average one-month London Inter-Bank Offering Rate (LIBOR) for the United States Dollar as reported from time to time in The Wall Street Journal, effective for the first date on which payment was delinquent and calculated on the number of days such payment is overdue or, if such rate is not regularly published, as published in such source as the Joint Steering Committee agrees.   6.9 Tax Withholding.   6.9.1 Any taxes, levies or other duties (\"Taxes\") paid or required to be withheld under the appropriate local tax laws by one of the Parties (\"Withholding Party\") on account of monies payable to the other Party under this Agreement shall, subject to Sections 6.9.2 and 6.9.3, be deducted from the amount of monies otherwise payable to the other Party under this Agreement. The Withholding Party shall secure and send to the other Party within a reasonable period of time proof of any such Taxes paid or required to be withheld by Withholding Party for the benefit of the other Party.   6.9.2 If GSK or any GSK Affiliate is or becomes liable to withhold any taxes from payments made to Theravance under Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of this Agreement, then GSK shall pay to Theravance an amount equal to the amount GSK or the applicable GSK Affiliate owes to the relevant tax authority provided always that if Theravance is able to obtain credit for any taxes withheld (\"Creditable Taxes\") against any liability to tax either in the year in which the receipt is taxable or any preceding years, Theravance shall reimburse to GSK an amount equivalent to the Creditable Taxes. Theravance shall provide GSK with such reasonable evidence as GSK may reasonably request to determine whether the taxes are creditable against taxes payable by Theravance.   6.9.3 If GSK or any GSK Affiliate is or becomes liable to withhold any taxes from payments made to Theravance under Section 6.3, then such taxes may be withheld by GSK or the applicable GSK Affiliate up to a limit of five percent (5%) of the relevant payment. GSK shall pay to Theravance an amount equal to the amount GSK owes to the relevant tax authority in excess of such five percent (5%) provided always that if Theravance is able to obtain credit for any taxes withheld (\"Creditable Taxes\") against any liability to tax either in the year in which the receipt is taxable or any preceding years, Theravance shall reimburse to GSK an amount equivalent to the Creditable Taxes. Theravance shall provide GSK with such reasonable evidence as GSK may reasonably request to determine whether the taxes are creditable against taxes payable by Theravance.   6.10 Financial Records; Audits. GSK shall keep, and shall cause its Affiliates and sublicensees to keep, such accurate and complete records of Net Sales as are necessary to determine the amounts due to Theravance under this Agreement and such records shall be retained by GSK or any of its Affiliates or sublicensees (in such capacity, the \"Recording Party\") for at least the three preceding Calendar Years to which the Net Sales relate. During normal business hours and with reasonable advance notice to the Recording Party, such records shall be made available for inspection, review and audit, at the request and expense of Theravance, by an independent certified public accountant, or the local equivalent, appointed by Theravance and reasonably acceptable to the Recording Party for the sole purpose of verifying the accuracy of the Recording Party's accounting reports and payments made or to be made pursuant to this   27\n\n\n\n\n\n  Agreement; provided, however that such audits may not be performed by Theravance more than once per Calendar Year. Such accountants shall be instructed not to reveal to Theravance the details of its review, except for (i) such information as is required to be disclosed under this Agreement and (ii) such information presented in a summary fashion as is necessary to report the accountants' conclusions to Theravance, and all such information shall be deemed Confidential Information of the Recording Party; provided, however, that in any event such information may be presented to Theravance in a summary fashion as is necessary to report the accountants' conclusions. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with performing any such audit shall be paid by Theravance unless the audit discloses at least a five percent (5%) shortfall, in which case the Recording Party will bear the full cost of the audit for such Calendar Year. Theravance will be entitled to recover any shortfall in payments due to it as determined by such audit, plus interest thereon calculated in accordance with Section 6.8, or alternatively shall have the right to offset and deduct any such shortfall in payments due to it against payments Theravance is otherwise required to make to the Reporting Party under this Agreement.

Such regulatory documents for each filing shall be centralized and held at the offices of GSK. Theravance shall provide such reasonable assistance as may be required by GSK where liaison between the Parties is, or may be, necessary to enable GSK to fulfill its responsibilities hereunder. GSK shall be responsible for maintaining the Approvals obtained under this Section and shall solely own all such Approvals in the Territory. GSK shall be fully responsible for bearing all costs and expense associated with undertaking and completing said registration activities in the Territory, including but not limited to the costs of preparing and prosecuting applications for such Approvals and fees payable to regulatory agencies in obtaining and maintaining same.   8.3 Exchange of Drug Safety Information. Subject to the second sentence of this Section 8.3, GSK shall be responsible for recording, investigating, summarizing, notifying, reporting and reviewing all Adverse Drug Experiences in accordance with Law and shall require that its Affiliates (i) adhere to all requirements of applicable Laws which relate to the reporting and investigation of Adverse Drug Experiences, and (ii) keep the Joint Project Committee apprised on a regular basis of such matters arising therefrom. The foregoing shall be subject to any of Theravance's own clinical safety obligations mandated by Law as a result of its ongoing Development activity related to TD-3327 (as such activity is more specifically referred to in Article 4) and, in acknowledgement of this, it is thereby contemplated that the Parties' respective clinical safety groups may need to discuss and agree, at the appropriate time after the Effective Date, appropriate safety data exchange procedures related to same.   8.4 Recalls or Other Corrective Action.

The Receiving Party will cooperate reasonably with the Disclosing Party's efforts to protect the confidentiality of the information.   10.3 Publications. Subject to any Third Party rights existing as of the Effective Date, each Party shall submit to the Joint Project Committee for review and approval all proposed academic, scientific and medical publications and public presentations relating to a Collaboration Product or any research or Development activities under this Agreement for review in connection   31\n\n\n\n\n\n  with preservation of Patent Rights, and trade secrets and/or to determine whether Confidential Information should be modified or deleted from the proposed publication or public presentation. Written copies of such proposed publications and presentations shall be submitted to the Joint Project Committee no later than sixty (60) days before submission for publication or presentation and the Joint Project Committee shall provide its comments with respect to such publications and presentations within ten (10) Business Days of its receipt of such written copy. The review period may be extended for an additional sixty (60) days if a representative of the non-publishing Party on the Joint Project Committee can demonstrate a reasonable need for such extension including, but not limited to, the preparation and filing of patent applications. By mutual agreement of the Parties, this period may be further extended. The Parties will each comply with standard academic practice regarding authorship of scientific publications and recognition of contribution of other parties in any publications relating to the Collaboration Products or any research or Development activities under this Agreement.   10.4 Public Announcements. Except as may be expressly permitted under Section 10.3 or required by applicable Laws and subject to the final two sentences of this Section 10.4, neither Party will make any public announcement of any information regarding this Agreement, the Collaboration Products or any research or Development activities under this Agreement without the prior written approval of the other Party, which approval shall not be withheld unreasonably. Once any statement is approved for disclosure by the Parties or information is otherwise made public in accordance with the preceding sentence, either Party may make a subsequent public disclosure of the contents of such statement without further approval of the other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, within sixty (60) days following the Effective Date, appropriate representatives of the Parties will meet and agree upon a process and principles for reaching timely consensus on how the Parties will make public disclosure concerning this Agreement, the Collaboration Products or any research and Development activities under this Agreement.   10.5 Confidentiality of This Agreement. The terms of this Agreement shall be Confidential Information of each Party and, as such, shall be subject to the provisions of this Article 10.

In such event, the disclosing Party will seek appropriate confidentiality of those portions of the Agreement for which confidential treatment is typically permitted by the relevant Governmental Authority.   10.6 Termination of Prior Confidentiality Agreements. Except as expressly provided in this Section 10.6, this Agreement supercedes the Mutual Confidential Disclosure Agreement (the \"MCDA\") between the Parties dated April 10, 2002. Except as expressly provided in this Section 10.6 and in Paragraph 8 of the Confidentiality Agreement between the Parties dated October 2, 2002 (the \"Patent CDA\"), this Agreement supersedes the Patent CDA. Except as set forth in Paragraph 8 of the Patent CDA, all information disclosed pursuant to the MCDA and the Patent CDA shall be subject to the provisions of this Article 10.   10.7 Survival. The obligations and prohibitions contained in this Article 10 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for a period of ten (10) years.   32\n\n\n\n\n\n  ARTICLE 11 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; COVENANTS   11.1 Mutual Representations and Warranties.

Subject to Sections 12.4 and 13.2, GSK shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Theravance and its Affiliates and each of their officers, directors, shareholders, employees, successors and assigns from and against all Claims of Third Parties, and all associated Losses, to the extent arising out of (a) GSK's negligence or willful misconduct in performing any of its obligations under this Agreement, (b) a breach by GSK of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement, or (c) the manufacture, use, handling, storage, marketing, sale, distribution or other disposition of Collaboration Products by GSK, its Affiliates, agents or sublicensees, except to the extent such losses result from the negligence or willful misconduct of Theravance.   12.2 Indemnification by Theravance. Subject to Sections 12.4 and 13.2, Theravance shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless GSK and its Affiliates and each of their officers, directors, shareholders, employees, successors and assigns from and against all Claims of Third Parties, and all associated Losses, to the extent arising out of (a) Theravance's negligence or willful misconduct in performing any of its obligations under this Agreement, or (b) a breach by Theravance of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement.   35\n\n\n\n\n\n  12.3 Procedure for Indemnification.   12.3.1 Notice. Each Party will notify promptly the other in writing if it becomes aware of a Claim (actual or potential) by any Third Party (a \"Third Party Claim\") for which indemnification may be sought by that Party and will give such information with respect thereto as the other Party shall reasonably request. If any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) is instituted involving any Party for which such Party may seek an indemnity under Section 12.1 or 12.2, as the case may be (the \"Indemnified Party\"), the Indemnified Party shall not make any admission or statement concerning such Third Party Claim, but shall promptly notify the other Party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") orally and in writing and the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall meet to discuss how to respond to any Third Party Claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. The Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party to the extent any admission or statement made by the Indemnified Party or any failure by such Party to notify the Indemnifying Party of the claim materially prejudices the defense of such claim.   12.3.2 Defense of Claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects to defend or, if local procedural rules or laws do not permit the same, elects to control the defense of a Third Party Claim, it shall be entitled to do so provided it gives notice to the Indemnified Party of its intention to do so within forty-five (45) days after the receipt of the written notice from the Indemnified Party of the potentially indemnifiable Third Party Claim (the \"Litigation Condition\"). The Indemnifying Party expressly agrees the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for satisfying and discharging any award made to or settlement reached with the Third Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement without prejudice to any provision in this Agreement or right at law which will allow the Indemnifying Party subsequently to recover any amount from the Indemnified Party to the extent the liability under such settlement or award was attributable to the Indemnified Party. Subject to compliance with the Litigation Condition, the Indemnifying Party shall retain counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party (such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld, refused, conditioned or delayed) to represent the Indemnified Party and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall not settle any claim for which it is seeking indemnification without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, refused, conditioned or delayed. The Indemnified Party shall, if requested by the Indemnifying Party, cooperate in all reasonable respects in the defense of such claim that is being managed and/or controlled by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, refused, conditioned or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in which the Indemnified Party is, or based on the same set of facts could have been, a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by the Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. If the Litigation Condition is not met, then neither Party shall have the right to control the defense of such Third Party Claim and the Parties shall cooperate in and be consulted on the material aspects of such defense at each Party's own expense; provided that if the Indemnifying Party does not satisfy the Litigation Condition, the Indemnifying Party may at any subsequent time during the pendency of the relevant Third Party Claim irrevocably elect, if permitted by local procedural rules or laws, to defend and/or to control the defense of the relevant Third Party Claim so long as the Indemnifying Party also agrees to pay the reasonable fees and costs incurred by the Indemnified Party in relation to the defense of such Third Party Claim from   36\n\n\n\n\n\n  the inception of the Third Party Claim until the date the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense or control thereof.   12.4 Assumption of Defense. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, an Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim with respect to the Indemnified Party, upon written notice to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 12.4, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be relieved of liability under Section 12.1 or 12.2, as applicable, solely for such Third Party Claim and related Losses.   12.5 Insurance. During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of one (1) year after the termination or expiration of this Agreement, GSK shall obtain and/or maintain at its sole cost and expense, product liability insurance (including any self-insured arrangements) in amounts which are reasonable and customary in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry for companies of comparable size and activities. Such product liability insurance or self-insured arrangements shall insure against all liability, including without limitation personal injury, physical injury, or property damage arising out of the manufacture, sale, distribution, or marketing of the Collaboration Products. GSK shall provide written proof of the existence of such insurance to Theravance upon request.   ARTICLE 13 PATENTS   13.1 Prosecution and Maintenance of Patents.   13.1.1 Prosecution and Maintenance of Theravance Patents. Theravance shall have the exclusive right and the obligation to (subject to Theravance's election not to file, prosecute, or maintain pursuant to Section 13.1.4) or to cause its licensors to, prepare, file, prosecute in a diligent manner (including without limitation by conducting interferences, oppositions and reexaminations or other similar proceedings), maintain (by timely paying all maintenance fees, renewal fees, and other such fees and costs required under applicable Laws) and extend all Theravance Patents and related applications. Theravance shall consult with GSK prior to abandoning any Theravance Patents or related applications that are material to the matters contemplated in this Agreement. Theravance shall regularly advise GSK of the status of all pending applications, including with respect to any hearings or other proceedings before any Governmental Authority, and, at GSK's request, shall provide GSK with copies of all documentation concerning such applications, including all correspondence to and from any Governmental Authority. Subject to Section 2.3.3, Theravance shall solicit GSK's advice and review of the nature and text of such patent applications and important prosecution matters related thereto in reasonably sufficient time prior to filing thereof, and Theravance shall take into account GSK's reasonable comments related thereto; provided, however, Theravance shall have the final decision authority with respect to any action relating to any Theravance Patent. Within the priority period, Theravance shall agree with GSK regarding the countries outside the United States in which corresponding applications should be filed (\"OUS Filings\"). It is presumed that a corresponding Patent Cooperation Treaty (\"PCT\") application will be filed unless otherwise agreed by the Parties. Theravance shall effect filing of all such applications within the priority period.   Subject to Section 13.1.4, Theravance shall be responsible for all costs incurred in the United States in connection with procuring Theravance Patents, including applications preparation, filing fees, prosecution, maintenance and all costs associated with reexamination and   37\n\n\n\n\n\n  interference proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and United States Courts. GSK shall be responsible for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Theravance after the Effective Date that are associated with procuring corresponding OUS patents, including without limitation PCT and individual country filing fees, translations, maintenance, annuities, and protest proceedings. For all such OUS patent applications, Theravance will invoice GSK on a quarterly basis beginning April 1, 2003, setting forth all such expenses incurred. Reimbursement will be made to Theravance in United States Dollars within thirty (30) days of receipt of the invoice by GSK. GSK will within thirty (30) days following the Effective Date identify the GSK representative that should receive such invoices from Theravance. GSK's obligations hereunder are in addition to any obligations of GSK under Section 13.1.2(b)   13.1.2 Prosecution and Maintenance of Patents Covering Joint Inventions.   (a) For Patents covering Joint Inventions, the Parties shall agree, without prejudice to ownership, which Party shall have the right to prepare and file a priority patent application, and prosecute such application(s) and maintain any patents derived therefrom, with the Parties equally sharing the reasonable out-of-pocket costs for the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of such priority patent application. The Parties will reasonably cooperate to obtain any export licenses that might be required for such activities. Should the agreed upon Party elect not to prepare and/or file any such priority patent application, it shall (i) provide the other Party with written notice as soon as reasonably possible after making such election but in any event no later than sixty (60) days before the other Party would be faced with a possible loss of rights, (ii) give the other Party the right, at the other Party's discretion and sole expense, to prepare and file the priority application(s), and (iii) offer reasonable assistance in connection with such preparation and filing at no cost to the other Party except for reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the agreed upon Party in rendering such assistance. The other Party, at its discretion and cost, shall prosecute such application(s) and maintain sole ownership of any patents derived therefrom.   (b) Within nine (9) months after the filing date of a priority application directed to an Invention, the Party filing the priority application shall request that the other Party identify those non-priority, non-PCT (\"foreign\") Countries in which the other Party desires that the Party filing the priority application file corresponding patent applications. Within thirty (30) days after receipt by the other Party of such request from the Party filing the priority application, the other Party shall provide to the Party filing the priority application a written list of such foreign countries in which the other Party wishes to effect corresponding foreign patent applications filings. The Parties will then attempt to agree on the particular countries in which such applications will be filed, provided that in the event agreement is not reached, the application will be filed in the disputed as well as the non-disputed countries (all such filings referred to hereinafter as \"Designated Foreign Filings\"). Thereafter, within twelve (12) months after the filing date of the priority application, the Party filing the priority application shall effect all such Designated Foreign Filings. It is presumed unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties, that a corresponding PCT application will be filed designating all PCT member countries. As to each Designated Foreign Filing and PCT application, GSK shall bear the costs for the filing and prosecutions of such Designated Foreign Filing and PCT application (including entering national phase in all agreed countries). Should the Party filing the priority application not agree to file or cause to be filed a Designated Foreign Filing, the other Party will have the right to effect such Designated Foreign Filing in its name.   38\n\n\n\n\n\n  (c) Should the filing Party pursuant to Section 13.1.2(a) or 13.1.2(b) no longer wish to prosecute and/or maintain any patent application or patent resulting from such application, the filing Party shall (i) provide the non-filing Party with written notice of its wish no later than sixty (60) days before the patent or patent applications would otherwise become abandoned, (ii) give the non-filing Party the right, at the non-filing Party's election and sole expense, to prosecute and/or maintain such patent or patent application, and (iii) offer reasonable assistance to the non- filing Party in connection with such prosecution and/or maintenance at no cost to the non-filing Party except for reimbursement of the filing Party's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the filing Party in rendering such assistance.   (d) Should the non-filing Party pursuant to Section 13.1.2(c) not wish to incur its share of preparation, filing, prosecution and/or maintenance costs for a patent application filed pursuant to Section 13.1.2(a) or 13.1.2(b) or patents derived therefrom, it shall (i) provide the filing Party with written notice of its wish, and (ii) continue to offer reasonable assistance to the filing Party in connection with such prosecution or maintenance at no cost to the filing Party except for reimbursement of the non-filing Party's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the non-filing Party in rendering such assistance.   (e) The Parties agree to cooperate in the preparation and prosecution of all patent applications filed under Section 13.1.2(a) and 13.1.2(b), including obtaining and executing necessary powers of attorney and assignments by the named inventors, providing relevant technical reports to the filing Party concerning the invention disclosed in such patent application, obtaining execution of such other documents which shall be needed in the filing and prosecution of such patent applications, and, as requested, updating each other regarding the status of such patent applications.   13.1.3 Prosecution and Maintenance of GSK Patents. GSK shall have the exclusive right and obligation to (subject to GSK's election not to file, prosecute or maintain pursuant to Section 13.1.5) or to cause its licensors to, prepare, file and prosecute in a diligent manner (including without limitation by conducting interferences, oppositions and reexaminations or other similar proceedings), maintain (by timely paying all maintenance fees, renewal fees, and other such fees and costs required under applicable Laws) and extend all GSK Patents and related applications. Consistent with Section 2.3.3, GSK will consult with Theravance within the priority period for any patent application that is material to this Agreement concerning Countries in which corresponding applications will be filed. In the event the Parties can not agree, GSK shall make the final decision. GSK shall consult with Theravance prior to abandoning any GSK Patents or related applications that are material to the matters contemplated in this Agreement. GSK shall regularly advise Theravance of the status of all pending applications, including with respect to any hearings or other proceedings before any Governmental Authority, and, at Theravance's request, shall provide Theravance with copies of documentation relating to such applications, including all correspondence to and from any Governmental Authority. Subject to Section 2.3.3, GSK shall solicit Theravance's advice and review of the nature and text of such patent applications and important prosecution matters related thereto in reasonably sufficient time prior to filing thereof, and GSK shall take into account Theravance's reasonable comments relating thereto; provided that GSK shall have the final decision authority with respect to any action relating to a GSK Patent.   13.1.4 GSK Step-In Rights. If Theravance elects not to file, prosecute or maintain the Theravance Patents or claims encompassed by such Theravance Patents necessary for GSK to exercise its rights hereunder in any Country, Theravance shall give GSK notice thereof within a reasonable period prior to allowing such Theravance Patents, or such claims encompassed by   39\n\n\n\n\n\n  such Theravance Patents, to lapse or become abandoned or unenforceable, and GSK shall thereafter have the right, at its sole expense, to prepare, file, prosecute and maintain such Theravance Patents in such Country.   13.1.5 Theravance Step-In Rights. If GSK elects not to file, prosecute or maintain the GSK Patents or claims encompassed by such GSK Patents necessary for Theravance to exercise its license rights hereunder in any Country, GSK shall give Theravance notice thereof within a reasonable period prior to allowing such GSK Patents, or such claims encompassed by such GSK Patents, to lapse or become abandoned or unenforceable, and Theravance shall thereafter have the right, at its sole expense, to prepare, file, prosecute and maintain such GSK Patents in such Country. In the event that GSK elects not to file, prosecute or maintain GSK Patents or claims that would affect the royalty owed Theravance pursuant to Section 6.3, GSK shall reimburse Theravance for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Theravance in connection with Theravance exercising its Step-In Rights under this Section.   13.1.6 Execution of Documents by Agents. Each of the Parties shall execute or have executed by its appropriate agents such documents as may be necessary to obtain, perfect or maintain any Patent Rights filed or to be filed pursuant to this Agreement, and shall cooperate with the other Party so far as reasonably necessary with respect to furnishing all information and data in its possession reasonably necessary to obtain or maintain such Patent Rights.   13.1.7 Patent Term Extensions. The Parties shall cooperate with each other in gaining patent term extension where applicable to Collaboration Products. The Joint Steering Committee shall determine which patents the Parties shall endeavor to have extended. All filings for such extension will be made by the Party to whom the patent is assigned after consultation with the other Party. In the event the Joint Steering Committee can not agree, the Party who is assigned the compound patent covering the LABA in the Collaboration Product will make the decision.   13.2 Patent Infringement.   13.2.1 Infringement Claims. With respect to any and all Claims instituted by Third Parties against Theravance or GSK or any of their respective Affiliates for patent infringement involving the manufacture, use, license, marketing or sale of a Collaboration Product in the United States during the Term (each, a \"Patent Infringement Claim\") as applicable, Theravance and GSK will assist one another and cooperate in the defense and settlement of such Patent Infringement Claims at the other Party's request.   13.2.2 Infringement of Theravance Patents. In the event that Theravance or GSK becomes aware of actual or threatened infringement of a Theravance Patent during the Term, that Party will promptly notify the other Party in writing (a \"Patent Infringement Notice\"). Theravance will have the right but not the obligation to bring an infringement action against any Third Party. If Theravance elects to pursue such infringement action, Theravance shall be solely responsible for the costs and expenses associated with such action and retain all recoveries. During the Term, in the event that Theravance does not undertake such an infringement action, upon Theravance's written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, refused, conditioned or delayed, GSK shall be permitted to do so in Theravance's or the relevant Theravance Affiliate's name and on Theravance's or the relevant Theravance Affiliate's behalf. If Theravance has consented to an infringement action but GSK is not recognized by the applicable court or other relevant body as having the requisite standing to pursue such action, then GSK may join Theravance as party-plaintiff. If GSK elects to pursue such infringement action, Theravance may be represented in   40\n\n\n\n\n\n  such action by attorneys of its own choice and its own expense with GSK taking the lead in such action.   13.2.3 Infringement of GSK Patents. In the event that GSK or Theravance becomes aware of actual or threatened infringement of a GSK Patent during the Term, that Party will promptly notify the other Party in writing. GSK will have the right but not the obligation to bring an infringement action against any Third Party. If GSK elects to pursue such infringement action, GSK shall be solely responsible for the costs and expenses associated with such action and retain all recoveries. During the Term, in the event that GSK does not undertake such an infringement action, upon GSK's written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, refused, conditioned or delayed, Theravance shall be permitted to do so in GSK's or the relevant GSK Affiliate's name and on GSK's or the relevant GSK Affiliate's behalf. If GSK has consented to an infringement action but Theravance is not recognized by the applicable court or other relevant body as having the requisite standing to pursue such action, then Theravance may join GSK as a party-plaintiff. If Theravance elects to pursue such infringement action, GSK may be represented in such action by attorneys of its own choice and at its own expense, with Theravance taking the lead in such action.   13.3 Notice of Certification. GSK and Theravance each shall immediately give notice to the other of any certification filed under the \"U.S. Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984\" (or its foreign equivalent) claiming that a GSK Patent or a Theravance Patent is invalid or that infringement will not arise from the manufacture, use or sale of any Collaboration Product by a Third Party (\"Hatch-Waxman Certification\").   13.3.1 Notice. If a Party decides not to bring infringement proceedings against the entity making such a certification, such Party shall give notice to the other Party of its decision not to bring suit within twenty-one (21) days after receipt of notice of such certification.   13.3.2 Option. Such other Party then may, but is not required to, bring suit against the entity that filed the certification.   13.3.3 Name of Party. Any suit by Theravance or GSK shall either be in the name of Theravance or in the name of GSK, (or any Affiliate) or jointly in the name of Theravance and GSK (or any Affiliate) , as may be required by law.   13.4 Assistance.

Any such termination shall become effective at the end of such 60-day period unless the Breaching Party has cured any such breach or default prior to the expiration of such 60-day period (or, if such default is capable of being cured but cannot be cured within such 60-day period, the Breaching Party has commenced and diligently continued actions to cure such default provided always that, in such instance, such cure must have occurred within one hundred twenty (120) days after written notice thereof was provided to the Breaching Party by the non-breaching Party to remedy such default).   14.3 GSK Right to Terminate Development of a Collaboration Product.

The provisions of this Section 14.6.3 shall apply only where a Terminated Commercialised Collaboration Product is not being or has not been replaced by an alternative Collaboration Product under this Agreement and provided that, in GSK's reasonable good faith judgment, exercise by Theravance alone or with a Third Party of any of the rights or activities contemplated by this Section 14.6.3 (which such rights or activities shall include access to a GSK compound and/or GSK proprietary formulations or devices including Diskus, (collectively \"GSK Property\")) will not materially damage GSK's continued development, regulatory or commercial use of such GSK Property. GSK will use reasonable efforts to assist Theravance in locating a mutually acceptable Third Party to carry out the rights and activities contemplated by this Section 14.6.3. Subject to the foregoing:   (a) If GSK terminates a Collaboration Product after First Commercial Sale of such Collaboration Product in one or more of the Major Market Countries, Theravance shall have the right in its sole discretion and at its sole expense, for its own benefit or together with a Third Party, to commercialize such Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product in any of such Major Market Countries where it has been terminated.   (b) If GSK terminates Commercialization of a Collaboration Product in all Countries of the Territory following the first commercial sale in any Country of the Territory, Theravance shall have the right in its sole discretion and at it sole expense, for its own benefit or together with a Third Party, to Commercialise such Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product in the Territory.   (c) Subject to Section 14.6.3(a), GSK shall grant to Theravance the appropriate licenses in the Territory (or in the case of a Country-by-Country termination, in the relevant Countries) under the GSK Patents, GSK Inventions and GSK Know-How to enable Theravance by itself and/or through one or more Third Party sublicensees, to Commercialize the Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product. GSK shall also provide Theravance with all such information and data which GSK, or its sublicensees reasonably have available in such Country, for example access to drug master file, clinical data and the like, and shall execute such instruments as Theravance reasonably requests, to enable Theravance to obtain the appropriate regulatory approvals to market such Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product in such Country and for any other lawful purpose related to Commercialization of such Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product in such Country.   (d) In the event Theravance exercises its rights under Section 14.6.3(a) and (b) above, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith a separate commercialization and supply agreement for such Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product which shall ensure that, based on commercially reasonable terms   45\n\n\n\n\n\n  (recognizing the Commercialized status of the Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product), Theravance has a continuous and uninterrupted supply of such Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product, for a suitable period of time to enable Theravance to secure Third Party supply.   (e) In the event of a Change in Control of Theravance, prior to termination by GSK under Section 14.4, none of the provisions under this Section 14.6.3 shall survive as they pertain to any Collaboration Product other than to a single agent LABA, its dry powder inhaler formulation, metered dose inhaler formulation, and metered dose inhaler device, as applicable; and the Parties will meet in good faith to explore other potential commercial options e.g. use of one or more Third Parties for possible continued Commercialisation of such Terminated Commercialised Collaboration Product if it is a LABA/ICS Combination Product or Other Combination Product.   (f) If GSK, in the exercise of its reasonable good faith judgment, determines that exercise by Theravance alone or with a Third Party of any of the rights or activities contemplated by this Section 14.6.3 will materially damage GSK's continued development, regulatory or commercial use of GSK Property, then GSK shall grant to Theravance, for such Terminated Commercialized Collaboration Product (excluding the non-LABA component of a Combination Product and/or Other Combination Product and GSK's Diskus delivery device and any information directed thereto), the appropriate licenses in the Territory under the GSK Patents, GSK Inventions and GSK Know-How related to the LABA compound, dry powder inhaler formulation, metered dose inhaler formulation, and metered dose inhaler device, as applicable, to enable Theravance to Commercialize a product containing the LABA Compound in the Field.   14.6.4 Effect of Termination of the Agreement Due to Discontinuation of Development Prior to First Commercial Sale of All Collaboration Products and All Pooled Compounds.

At Aduro's request and expense, Consultant shall assist Aduro in acquiring and maintaining its right in and title to, any Work Product. Such assistance may include, but will not be limited to, signing applications and other documents, cooperating in legal proceedings, and taking any other steps considered necessary or desirable by Aduro.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Nonsolicitation. From the Effective Date and for twelve (12) months after the termination of this Agreement (the \"Restricted Period\"), Consultant shall not, without Aduro's prior written consent, directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage any employee or contractor of Aduro or its affiliates to terminate employment with, or cease providing Services to, Aduro or its affiliates. In the event of a breach of this Paragraph 7 by Consultant, Aduro shall be entitled to entry of injunctive relief. Such injunctive remedy shall be nonexclusive and shall be in addition to any and all other remedies which may be available to it at law or in equity, including without limitation, the recovery of direct, indirect, incidental, consequential and/or punitive damages.\n\n8. Representations. Consultant represents as follows:\n\n(a) Consultant is not subject to any other agreement that Consultant will violate by signing this Agreement;\n\n(b) Consultant has and shall continue to have the knowledge, experience, qualifications and required skill to perform, and shall perform, the Services in a professional manner;\n\n(c) Consultant to perform the Services in accordance with all Applicable Law; and\n\n(d) During the term of this Agreement, Consultant will not, directly or indirectly (whether for compensation or without compensation) engage in or provide consulting services, or enter into any agreement either written or oral, that would present a material conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement, or would preclude Consultant from complying with the terms and conditions hereof. If during the term of this Agreement any situation or circumstance arises that might reasonably be expected to present a conflict of interest, or if Consultant might be unable to render Services or otherwise participate in such work without risk of breaching an obligation of confidentiality to another party, Consultant will promptly advise the Company's General Counsel of the situation and Company and Consultant shall, in good faith, attempt to resolve any such conflicts(s). If requested by the Company's General Counsel, Consultant will recuse herself from providing Services for the duration of the conflict.\n\n9. Material Non-Public Information. Consultant may have access to, or learn, \"material non-public information\" about Aduro or companies working with Aduro during the course of performing Services under this Agreement. Consultant acknowledges that it is illegal to buy or sell Aduro's stock or the stock of companies working with Aduro, on the basis of \"material non-public information.\" It is also illegal to pass such information on to others who use it to buy or sell Aduro stock. Consultant is subject to and will comply with Aduro's Insider Trading and Trading Window Policy.\n\n10. Miscellaneous. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflict of law principles of California or any other jurisdiction. This Agreement contains the entire agreement and understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and merges and supersedes all prior discussions, agreements and understandings of every nature between them with respect to the subject matter hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement does not supersede or in modify in anyway any other written agreement between the parties. This Agreement may not be changed or modified, except by an agreement in writing signed by both of the parties hereto. The obligations of Consultant as set forth herein, other than Consultant's obligations to perform the Project, shall survive the termination of Consultant's engagement with Aduro. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain effective and enforceable to the greatest extent permitted by law. This Agreement shall not be assignable by Consultant. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and each such counterpart shall be deemed to be an original instrument, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nADURO BIOTECH, INC.

Seller shall not in any event be liable for any special, incidental, exemplary or consequential damages.\n\nSubject to the Clauses on Quantity, Transfer of Risk and Title Transfer, Buyer shall inspect and test product delivered hereunder for damage, defect or shortage immediately upon receipt and provide Seller notice of any such damage, defect or shortage within ten (10) days of receipt. Any claim must be accompanied by documents as required by Seller, including but not limited to a certified weigh scale ticket or an independent surveyor report, and Seller shall have an opportunity to an independent assessment. All claims for any cause whatsoever, whether based in contract, negligence or other tort, strict liability, breach of warranty or otherwise, shall be deemed waived unconditionally and absolutely unless Seller receives complete written details of such claim not later than [*****] after Buyer's receipt of product as to which such claim is made. Receipt will be deemed to have taken place for purposes of this subparagraph when the product has been loaded onto Buyer's transport, or offloaded from the vessel or other means of transport on which delivery has been made when delivery is arranged by Seller. LAYTIME AND DEMURRAGE Buyer shall unload tank containers, cars, trucks and barges furnished by Seller and clear products from port, or at delivery destination, within the free time specified by tariffs or time periods on file with applicable bodies, or promptly after receipt if no such tariffs or time periods are on file.

The Consultant further acknowledges that each original work of authorship which is made by the Consultant (solely or jointly with others) within the scope of this Agreement and which is protectable by copyright is a \"work made for hire,\" as that term is defined in the United States Copyright Act.\n\n(b) The Consultant agrees that if, in the course of performing the Services, the Consultant incorporates into any Invention developed under this Agreement any preexisting invention, improvement, development, concept, discovery or other proprietary information owned by the Consultant or in which the Consultant has an interest (\"Prior Inventions\"), (i) the Consultant will inform the Company, in writing before incorporating such Prior Inventions into any Invention, and (ii) the Company is hereby granted a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable worldwide license with the right to grant and authorize sublicenses, to make, have made, modify, use, import, offer for sale, sell, reproduce, distribute, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works of, display, perform, and otherwise exploit such Prior Inventions, without restriction, including, without limitation, as part of or in connection with such Invention, and to practice any method related thereto.

The Consultant also hereby waives all claims to moral rights in any Inventions.\n\n(d) The Consultant shall promptly disclose to the Company all Inventions and will maintain adequate and current written records (in the form of notes, sketches, drawings and as may be specified by the Company) to document the conception and/or first actual reduction to practice of any Invention. Such written records shall be available to and remain the sole property of the Company at all times. - 4 -\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Non-Solicitation.

The Consultant further represents that Consultant's performance of all the terms of this Agreement and the performance of the services as a consultant of the Company do not and will not breach any agreement with any third party to which the Consultant is a party (including, without limitation, any nondisclosure or non-competition agreement), and that the Consultant will not disclose to the Company or induce the Company to use any confidential or proprietary information or material belonging to any current or previous employer or others.\n\n8.2 The Consultant hereby represents, warrants and covenants that Consultant has the skills and experience necessary to perform the services, that Consultant will perform said services in a professional, competent and timely manner, that Consultant has the power to enter into this Agreement and that Consultant's performance hereunder will not infringe upon or violate the rights of any third party or violate any federal, state or municipal laws.\n\n9. Independent Contractor Status.\n\n9.1 The Consultant shall perform all services under this Agreement as an \"independent contractor\" and not as an employee or agent of the Company. The Consultant is not authorized to assume or create any obligation or responsibility, express or implied, on behalf of, or in the name of, the Company or to bind the Company in any manner.\n\n9.2 The Consultant shall have the right to control and determine the time, place, methods, manner and means of performing the services. In performing the services, the amount of time devoted by the Consultant on any given day will be entirely within the Consultant's control, and the Company will rely on the Consultant to put in the amount of time necessary to fulfill the requirements of this Agreement. The Consultant will provide all equipment and supplies required to perform the services. The Consultant is not required to attend regular meetings at the Company.

Remedies. The Consultant acknowledges that any breach of the provisions of Section 1, 6 or 7 of this Agreement shall result in serious and irreparable injury to the Company for which the Company cannot be adequately compensated by monetary damages alone. The Consultant agrees, therefore, that, in addition to any other remedy the Company may have, the Company shall be entitled to enforce the specific performance of this Agreement by the Consultant and to seek both temporary and permanent injunctive relief (to the extent permitted by law) without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting a bond.\n\n11. Notices. All notices required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed effective upon personal delivery or upon deposit in the United States Post Office, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the other party at the address shown above, or at such other address or addresses as either party shall designate to the other in accordance with this Section 11.\n\n12.

Whenever the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular forms of nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa.\n\n13. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.\n\n14. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written instrument executed by both the Company and the Consultant.\n\n15. Non-Assignability of Contract. This Agreement is personal to the Consultant and the Consultant shall not have the right to assign any of Consultant's rights or delegate any of Consultant's duties without the express written consent of the Company. Any non-consented-to assignment or delegation, whether express or implied or by operation of law, shall be void and shall constitute a breach and a default by the Consultant. - 6 -\n\n\n\n\n\n16. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the application of laws of any other jurisdiction.\n\n17. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, both parties and their respective successors and assigns, including any corporation with which, or into which, the Company may be merged or which may succeed to its assets or business, provided, however, that the obligations of the Consultant are personal and shall not be assigned by Consultant.\n\n18. Interpretation. If any restriction set forth in Section 1, 6 or 7 is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it extends for too long a period of time or over too great a range of activities or in too broad a geographic area, it shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time, range of activities or geographic area as to which it may be enforceable.\n\n19. Survival. The last sentence of Section 1 and Sections 4 through 20 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n20. Miscellaneous.\n\n20.1 No delay or omission by the Company in exercising any right under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of that or any other right. A waiver or consent given by the Company on any one occasion shall be effective only in that instance and shall not be construed as a bar or waiver of any right on any other occasion.\n\n20.2 The captions of the sections of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and in no way define, limit or affect the scope or substance of any section of this Agreement.\n\n20.3 In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or otherwise unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall in no way be affected or impaired thereby.\n\n[Remainder of Page Intentionally Left Blank] - 7 -\n\n\n\n\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Consulting Agreement as of the date and year first above written.

Upon any failure by      Distributor to make Gross Purchases in sufficient amounts to meet or exceed      the applicable cumulative Guaranteed Minimum Purchases, WGT may, at its      sole option and effective upon notice to Distributor, terminate this      Agreement. Distributor shall pay WGT fifty percent (50%) of the unpaid      balance of cumulative Guaranteed Minimum Purchase amounts as liquidated      damages. The parties acknowledge and agree that it would be difficult or      impossible to calculate WGT's actual damages arising from Distributor's      failure to timely pay all of the Guaranteed Minimum Purchases. Therefore,      the parties have agreed upon the above payment of liquidated damages in      lieu of WGT's claim for actual damages from such breach.\n\n5.4  Termination by Distributor.

Any termination pursuant to paragraphs 5.2, 5.3, or      5.4 will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy afforded to      either party under this Agreement or any applicable law (e.g., in the case      of any breach or default by the other party), and will not affect any      rights or obligations which have arisen prior to the date of such      termination. In the event of termination, Distributor will:\n\n                                       6\n\n(a)  immediately cease to demonstrate, market, sublicense and distribute the      Product in the Territory;\n\n(b)  cease use of all Trademarks of WGT;\n\n(c)  return to WGT within twenty (20) days following the expiration or      termination of the Term, any and all (i) demonstration Product provided to      Distributor; (ii) Products not already paid for in full by Distributor; and      (iii) promotional literature, data, information and other items received by      Distributor under this Agreement; and\n\n(d)  furnish WGT with such information relating to the marketing, sale or      distribution of the Product in the Territory as WGT may reasonably request      (including, but not limited to, information as to calls or the status of      any negotiations for the sale of the Product, or any sales or service      records).\n\nUpon the expiration or termination of the Term, the license granted under Section 2 of this Agreement will terminate. Any end-user licenses of the Software granted under the terms of this Agreement will survive the end of the Term in accordance with the terms of the applicable end-user license agreement.\n\n5.6  Acknowledgment. Any expiration or termination of the Term will be final and      absolute. Except as expressly set forth in paragraphs 5.3 and 5.5(c),      Distributor waives any right, either express or implied by applicable law      or otherwise, to the renewal of this Agreement or to any damages or      compensation for any expiration or termination of the Term in accordance      with this Section 5. Each of the parties have considered the possibility of      such expiration or termination and the possibility of loss and damage      resulting therefrom in making expenditures pursuant to the performance of      this Agreement. It is the express intent and agreement of the parties that      neither will be liable to the other for damages, except as expressly set      forth in paragraphs 5.3 and 5.5(c), or otherwise by reason of the      expiration or termination of the Term as provided for herein.\n\n6.0  Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for, or be considered to be in      breach of or default under this Agreement on account of, any delay or\n\n\n\n\n\n     failure to perform as required by this Agreement (other than for payment      under Section 3), as a result of any cause or condition beyond such party's      reasonable control.\n\n7.0  Entire Agreement. This Agreement is subject to the provisions of WGT's      Standard Distributor Terms attached hereto as Exhibit B and by this      reference incorporated into and as part of this Agreement. This Agreement      is also subject to any additional terms or licenses executed by WGT and      Distributor and attached as Exhibits, including any Special Terms and      Conditions specified in Exhibit A. This Agreement sets forth the entire      agreement, and supersedes any and all prior agreements, among the parties      related to the Product. WGT will not be bound by, and specifically objects      to, any term, condition, or other provision that is different from or in      addition to the provisions of this Agreement (whether or not it would      materially alter this Agreement) and that is proffered by Distributor or      otherwise appears in any order, receipt, acceptance, confirmation,      correspondence, or otherwise, unless WGT specifically agrees to such      provision in a written instrument signed by WGT. No\n\n                                       7\n\n     modifications of any of the provisions of this Agreement will be valid      unless set forth in a written instrument signed by both parties. Any remedy      by WGT set forth in this Agreement is in addition to any other remedy      afforded to WGT under any other contract, by law, or otherwise.\n\nIN WITNESS THEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first above written.\n\nDistributor:                               WatchGuard Technologies, Inc.\n\nBy: /s/ LAURENCE GILBERT                   By: /s/ WATCHGUARD    -------------------------                  ------------------------------\n\nTitle: MANAGING DIRECTOR                   Title: VP/SALES\n\nDate Signed: NOVEMBER 5, 1997              Date Signed: NOVEMBER 3, 1997\n\nAddress:  20/24 Church Street              Required Signature:           Altrincham, Cheshire           WA14 4DW, ENGLAND                By:                                                 -------------------------------                                            Title: Executive Vice-President Sales\n\n                                           Date Signed:                                                          ---------------------\n\n                                           Address:  316 Occidental Avenue South                                                      Suite 300                                                      Seattle, Washington  98104\n\n                                       8\n\n                    FULL SERVICE MASTER DISTRIBUTOR SCHEDULE                                     EXHIBIT A\n\nPRODUCTS:\n\nDistributor will be entitled to order the following products (which includes hardware and software) at the following discounts of WGT's then current WatchGuard Price List:\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                        DISCOUNT FROM WGT'S                                  PRODUCT                  THEN CURRENT                                                       WATCHGUARD PRICE LIST - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WatchGuard Security System                             40% plus additional                                                        10% on the remaining                                                  undiscounted amount, i.e., 46%\n\n- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEXCHANGE FEE:                                      $10 per CD SUPPORT FEE:                                       $25,000 per year\n\n                                                                  CUMULATIVE                                                                   GUARANTEED                                                                     MINIMUM                                                                    PURCHASES                               DATE OF ORDER                     (U.S. DOLLARS) - -------------------------------------------------- --------------------------- Upon contract signing                              $100,000.00 1st subsequent Quarter-end, Sept. 30, 1997         $100,000.00 2nd subsequent Quarter-end, Dec. 31, 1997          $167,000.00 3rd subsequent Quarter-end, Mar. 31, 1997          $234,000.00 4th subsequent Quarter-end, Jun 30, 1997           $300,000.00\n\n\n\n\n\nTERMINATION DATE:                                           September 30, 1997 TRADEMARKS:\n\n/bullet/  WatchGuard(TM)\n\n/bullet/  WatchGuard(TM) Technologies\n\n/bullet/  WatchGuard(TM) SchoolMate\n\n/bullet/  Firebox(TM)\n\nTERRITORY:\n\n/bullet/  Europe\n\nSPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n                                       9\n\nThese Special Terms and Conditions are part of the Distributor Agreement between WatchGuard Technologies, Inc. (\"WGT\") and Distributor (collectively, the \"Agreement\"). Terms that are defined in the Distributor Agreement will have the same meaning when used in these Special Terms and Conditions.\n\nSection A.1 By joint agreement between WGT and Distributor, Distributor may engage in end user sales in the Territory.\n\nIf it is agreed that Distributor may engage in end user sales, Distributor may distribute, license and sell up to 20% of the Product purchased from WGT directly to end-users in the Territory. Further, Distributor agrees that high end-users satisfaction is a condition of its continued authorization by WGT. To ensure high end-user satisfaction, Distributor shall: (a) provide quality first level support to its end-user customers; (b) promptly report to WGT all suspected and actual problems with any WGT product; (c) assist WGT in tracing WGT Products to particular end users to distribute critical WGT Product information, locate WGT Products for safety reasons, or to be discover unauthorized marketing or infringing acts; (d) avoid deceptive, misleading or unethical conduct which are or might be detrimental to WGT or its WGT product; and (e) refrain from marking any representation, warranty or guarantee to end users with respect to the specifications, features or capabilities of the WGT Product that is inconsistent with the literature distributed by WGT or this Agreement.\n\nSection A.2 Distributor is legally organized under the jurisdiction of a country belonging to the European Union.\n\nIf Distributor is organized under the jurisdiction of the country belonging to the European Union, the following clause is hereby appended to Section 1(c) of the Standard Distributor Terms:\n\n         \"PROVIDED HOWEVER, the foregoing restriction is not intended to          preclude Distributor from fulfilling, and Distributor may fulfill,          unsolicited orders for Product received from outside the Territory but          within the European Union (and Distributor shall provide WGT written          notice of any such Sales);\"\n\nSection A.3 As a Full Service Master Distributor, Distributor agrees to sign up a minimum of 10 new WatchGuard resellers in the Territory within the Initial Term of the Agreement.\n\n- -------------------------------------------- --------------------------------- Distributor:                                 WatchGuard Technologies, Inc.:\n\nBy:  /s/ LAURENCE GILBERT                    By:  /s/ WATCHGUARD      --------------------------                   ----------------------------- Title: MANAGING DIRECTOR                     Title: SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT/SALES                                                      Date Signed:  NOVEMBER 5, 1997               Date Signed:  NOVEMBER 3, 1997  -------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------\n\n                                       10\n\n                           STANDARD DISTRIBUTOR TERMS                                     EXHIBIT B\n\nThese Standard Distributor Terms are part of the Distributor Agreement between WatchGuard Technologies, Inc. (\"WGT\") and Distributor (collectively, the \"Agreement\"). Terms that are defined in the Distributor Agreement will have the same meaning when used in these Standard Distributor Terms.\n\n 1.  Reservation of Rights. The Software is licensed, not sold, to Distributor.      PARAGRAPH 2.2 LICENSE GRANT of the Distributor Agreement sets forth the      entirety of Distributor's rights to use, market, distribute, demonstrate      and otherwise deal with the Product. All rights in and to the Product not      expressly granted to Distributor under this Agreement are hereby expressly      reserved to WGT without restriction. Without limiting the generality of the      foregoing, Distributor will comply with the following:\n\n(a)  Distributor will distribute the Product to resellers only pursuant to a      reseller agreement that substantially conforms to the term of this\n\n\n\n\n\n     Agreement;\n\n(b)  Distributor will not market, demonstrate or distribute the Product outside      the Territory and Distributor will not supply the Product to any reseller      that Distributor knows or has reason to know (i) intends to distribute the      Product outside the Territory or (ii) intends to use or install the Product      outside the Territory;\n\n(c)  Distributor will market, sell and distribute the Product only in its      original, unopened package as received from WGT under the terms of the      end-user license agreement and limited hardware warranty, as applicable,      originally included in the Product package;\n\n(d)  Distributor will not modify or make copies of the Product or translate or      port the Software into any other computer or human language;\n\n(e)  Distributor will not disassemble, reverse engineer, decompile or repackage      all or any component of the Product or otherwise attempt to discover any      portion of the source code or trade secrets related to the Product;\n\n(f)  Distributor will not remove, alter, distort, cover or modify any notice of      copyright, trademark or other proprietary right appearing in or on any item      included with the Product or its packaging; and\n\n(g)  Distributor will not register, attempt to register or assist anyone else to      register, directly or indirectly, the Trademarks or any copyright or other      proprietary rights associated with the Product in the Territory or      elsewhere other than in the name of WGT, without WGT's prior written      consent.\n\n2.   Protection Against Unauthorized Use. Distributor will promptly notify WGT      of any unauthorized use of the Product or the Trademarks which comes to      Distributor's attention. In\n\n                                       11\n\n     the event of any such unauthorized use by Distributor's employees, agents      or representatives, Distributor will use its best efforts to terminate such      unauthorized use and to retrieve any copy of the Product in the possession      or control of the person or entity engaging in such unauthorized use.      Distributor will immediately notify WGT of any legal proceeding initiated      by Distributor in connection with such unauthorized use. WGT may, at its      option and expense, participate in any proceeding and, in such event,      Distributor will provide such authority, information and assistance related      to such proceeding as WGT may reasonably request to protect WGT's      interests.\n\n3.   Use of Trademarks. WGT reserves all rights in and to the Trademarks and all      other trademarks and trade names used by WGT in connection with the      Products, but WGT grants to Distributor the nonexclusive right to use and      display the Trademarks during the Term to promote and identify the Product      in the Territory in connection with this Agreement. Distributor will comply      with the trademark guidelines and procedures established by WGT in      Distributor's use of the Trademarks including without limitation use of the      trademark and copyright symbols as specified by WGT from time to time. When      using the Trademarks, Distributor will include a statement acknowledging      that the Trademarks are owned by WGT. Distributor hereby acknowledges that      the goodwill associated with its use of the Trademarks inures solely and      exclusively to WGT and that Distributor does not acquire any rights in the      Trademarks as a result of such use. Distributor will not use the Trademarks      or any confusingly similar name, marks, logos, designs or artwork as part      of Distributor's name, trade name, trademark or artwork without WGT's prior      written consent.\n\n 4.  Independent Contractor. Distributor is an independent contractor, not an      employee, agent or franchisee of WGT. Distributor will not represent or      hold itself out as an employee, agent or franchisee of WGT. Distributor      does not have any authority to, and will not, create or assume any license,      warranty or other obligation, express or implied, on behalf of WGT. This      Agreement will not be interpreted or construed as creating or evidencing      any association, joint venture or partnership between the parties or as      imposing any partnership or franchisor obligation or liability on either      party.\n\n 5.  Delivery. WGT will deliver all Products ordered by Distributor F.O.B.      carrier at WGT's shipping location as determined by WGT from time to time,      on or before the delivery date set forth in each accepted order.      Distributor will pay or reimburse WGT for all shipping charges, premiums      for freight insurance, inspection fees, duties, import and export fees,      assessments, transportation and other costs incurred by WGT to transport      the Product to the shipping destination.\n\n 6.  Resale. Distributor represents that all Products acquired under this      Agreement are acquired solely for demonstration, licensing or sale (as      applicable) and distribution to resellers or end-users in the Territory      without intervening use by Distributor. Distributor acknowledges that the      prices set forth in this Agreement have been established in reliance upon      such representation and that different prices may apply to any Products      acquired for any other purpose. Upon WGT's request, Distributor will      furnish WGT evidence of such resale (including but not limited to      satisfactory evidence of exemption from retail sales, use or similar taxes      that may otherwise apply to transactions under this Agreement).\n\n\n\n\n\n                                       12\n\n7.   Software Update Exchange. Once each Quarter during the Term of this      Agreement, Distributor shall have the right to exchange any prior version      of the Software then in Distributor's inventory for an equivalent quantity      of Software containing Updates, subject to Distributor paying WGT an      \"Exchange Fee\" set forth in Exhibit A, for each copy of the Software      exchanged hereunder. WGT will invoice Distributor for and Distributor shall      pay all Exchange Fees as provided in Exhibit A. WGT will deliver all such      exchanged Software Updates in accordance with paragraph 5. Distributor      shall return to WGT the copies of the prior versions of the Software      exchanged under this paragraph 7 at Distributor's expense.\n\n8.   Records; Audit. During the Term and for twenty-four (24) months thereafter,      Distributor will keep and maintain accurate accounts and records regarding      the Products sold and Product license keys delivered to resellers and      end-users under this Agreement. Upon WGT's request, Distributor will      provide access to such records for examination, reproduction, and audit by      WGT or its representatives. Any such audit will be conducted at such times      and in such a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with Distributor's      normal operations. If any such audit discloses that Distributor is      deficient in its compliance with the terms and conditions of this      Agreement, Distributor will immediately pay to WGT any deficiency, plus      interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month running      from the date originally due until the date paid. Acceptance of any payment      by WGT will be without prejudice to WGT's rights to an audit under this      paragraph 8 or any other rights or remedies afforded to WGT under any other      provision of this Agreement or applicable law.\n\n9.   Taxes. The Guaranteed Minimum Purchases and other amounts specified in this      Agreement do not include sales, use or value added taxes, customs fees,      duties or other governmental taxes or charges. Distributor will pay all      such taxes and charges. In the event Distributor is required under any      applicable law to withhold any taxes or duties from the amounts specified      under this Agreement, payment of the amounts specified under this Agreement      will be net of such withholding taxes or duties. Distributor will pay the      amount of all such withholding taxes and duties and supply WGT with      information concerning the amount and type of tax withheld and any      certificates concerning payments of such withholding taxes.\n\n10.  Interest. Any amount not paid when due will be subject to finance charges      at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum      rate permitted by applicable law; whichever is less, determined and      compounded on a daily basis from the date due until the date paid. Payment      of such finance charges will not excuse or cure Distributor's breach or      default for late payment. If WGT retains a collection agency, attorney or      other person or entity to collect overdue payments, all collection costs,      including but not limited to reasonable attorney's fees, will be payable by      Distributor.\n\n11.  Confidentiality. Any information received by Distributor in performance of      this Agreement relating to the business affairs, customers, markets,      finances, methods, Product, technology, trade secrets or proprietary rights      of WGT will be treated as confidential and proprietary information of WGT.      Distributor will not disclose such information, unless the information is      in the public domain at the time of disclosure through no fault of      Distributor or WGT consents to the disclosure in writing. Distributor will      disclose such information only to its\n\n                                       13\n\n     employees whose duties justify their need to know such information and who      have agreed to copy with Distributor's confidentiality obligations      hereunder.\n\n12.  Ownership. The Product involves valuable patent, copyright, trade secret,      trade name, trademark and other proprietary rights of WGT. No title to or      ownership of such proprietary rights is transferred to Distributor under      this Agreement or by use of any trademark, copyright or other proprietary      right. WGT reserves all of its copyright, trade secret and other      proprietary rights in the Product. Distributor will not infringe, violate      or contest and will take appropriate steps and precautions for the      protection of, such proprietary rights.\n\n13.  Implementation. Distributor will take at WGT's expense, all action during      or after the Term that is reasonably requested by WGT for the      implementation of the ownership provisions of this Agreement or to      evidence, perfect or protect WGT's ownership of this Product and the      proprietary rights associated with ownership of the Product (including,      without limitation, the execution, acknowledgment and delivery of      instruments of conveyance, patent, copyright, trademark or other      proprietary rights registration applications or other documents.)\n\n14.  Warranty; Returns. WGT will permit Distributor and end-users purchasing      through resellers to return any defective Product in accordance with the      limited warranty contained in the applicable end-user license agreement or      limited hardware warranty, as applicable, provided that the Distributor and      end-user have compiled with the applicable warranty terms and conditions.      In order to receive the remedy provided for hereunder, Distributor shall\n\n\n\n\n\n     deliver to WGT a sample of the Product which Distributor finds to be      defective in workmanship or materials, or damaged in shipment prior to      Distributor assuming the risk of loss or damage , along with a written      explanation of the alleged defect within thirty (30) days from the later of      Distributor's initial receipt of such Product from WGT or from the delivery      of such Product to an end-user. In the event WGT verifies a defect reported      by Distributor and such defect affects more than one (1) Product, then at      WGT's option, Distributor shall either certify destruction of all defective      Products or return all Products which it alleges are defective to WGT.      Distributor, reseller or the end user will be responsible for      transportation charges for such Product units sent to WGT's facilities for      service. Provided that WGT is able to verify the presence of the reported      defect in such units, transportation charges, via a mode of transportation      chosen by WGT, shall be borne by WGT to return the Product units from WGT's      location to the Distributor, reseller or the end-user's location. Upon      verification of a defect in one or more Products returned in accordance      with the foregoing, or upon Distributor's certification that it has      destroyed any defective Product in compliance with WGT's instructions, WGT      will, at its option, either issue a credit to Distributor in the amount of      the purchase price paid or payable for such Product by Distributor or      replace the defective Product with an identical (non-defective) Product.      Such remedy will be exclusive and in full satisfaction of Distributor's      claims hereunder. WGT does not warrant that the Products are free form all      bugs, errors, defects, design flaws or omissions. The warranties in this      Agreement apply only to the latest version of each Product made available      by WGT to Distributor. Such warranties will not apply to any Product which      WGT determines has been subject to misuse, neglect, improper installation,      repair, alteration or damage by Distributor, reseller or an end-user or any      other individual or entity, or modification by any such individual or      entity except with the prior express authorization of WGT.

Method 1.  (a). Bizzingo will acquire basic business information for a prospective user of the Network, which will include all or part of the following; business  name and address, telephone number, email address or website. This basic business information will be acquired through (i) arrangements with  specific groups, clubs, networks, or associations, such as Chambers of Commerce, Universities, or trade organization, to acquire member  information, or (ii) through purchase or license arrangements with content providers. In either case, once Bizzingo obtains information for a  specific user, it will use that information to create or seed a separate user profile in its database for that prospective user (\"Seeded Profile\"). As of  the date of this Agreement, Bizzingo has arrangements with content providers and associations to provide the basic business information for over  6,000,000 prospective users which will be seeded by Bizzingo. For clarification purposes, at this point in the process, a Seeded Profile is not an  \"Activated User.\"     (b). In order to activate a Seeded Profile, Bizzingo will contact a prospective user informing them of the existence of their Seeded Profile on the  Network, and the prospective user is then required to: (i) search and locate the Bizzingo database for its Seeded Profile and (ii) claim the Seeded  Profile by editing or adding content to the Seeded Profile. Once the steps set forth in the immediately preceding sentence has been completed by a  user, that user will be deemed to be an \"Activated User\" and the Network will identify that user as an Activated User.     Method 2. A prospective user independently (from Method 1) may create its own user profile on the Network. This user will be deemed an  Activated User and the Network will identify that user as an \"Activated User.\"     II  Royalty and Initial Bonus     1. Royalty. The Royalty payable under the Agreement shall be in the form of one (1) common stock purchase warrant of Bizzingo (as further  described herein) for each Activated User (as defined above) that occurs during a Royalty Period determined on the last day of each Royalty  Period during the Term. It being the intent of the parties that no more than one (1) common stock purchase warrant shall be issued per Activated  User, and by way of example, if on the last day of the first and second Royalty Periods, the Network has 500,000 and 1,500,000 Activated Users,  respectively, Theismann shall receive 500,000 common stock purchase warrants for the first Royalty Period and an additional 1,000,000 common  stock purchase warrants for the second Royalty Period. Each common stock purchase warrant shall enable Theismann to acquire one (1) share of  common stock of Bizzingo at an exercise price of $0.15 per share during a term of five (5) years from the end of the applicable Royalty Period. The  form of the warrant is attached hereto as Schedule A-l and shall be referred to as the \"Royalty Warrant.\"\n\n\n\n9\n\nSource: BIZZINGO, INC., 8-K, 3/22/2012\n\n\n\n\n\n   2. Initial Bonus. Concurrent with the execution hereof, Bizzingo will issue Theismann, as a one time bonus, a common stock purchase warrant to  purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock of Bizzingo at a purchase price of $0.15 per share during a term of five (5) years.

Such provider may compensate Agent for processing and other services that Agent provides in connection with such in-depth search.\n\n(c) Upon locating any stockholder (or next of kin) pursuant to clause (b) above, the locating service provider shall clearly identify to such stockholder (or next of kin) all assets held in such stockholder's account. Such provider shall inform any such located stockholders (or next of kin) that they may choose either (i) to contact Agent directly to obtain the assets in such account, at no charge other than any applicable fees to replace lost certificates, or (ii) to use the services of such provider for a fee, which may not exceed (A) 10% of the asset value of such stockholder's property where the registered stockholder is a living person or (B) 20% of the asset value of such stockholder's property where the registered stockholder is deceased or is not a natural person; provided that in no case shall such fee exceed the maximum statutory fee permitted by the applicable state jurisdiction.

CHARGES\n\nShareholder Plan Enrollment: If Client has appointed a banking affiliate of Agent to administer a direct stock purchase and/or dividend reinvestment plan, Agent (on behalf of such affiliate) shall accept requests by Client's shareholders to enroll Shares in such plan via paper enrollment form, in the case of certificated securities, and via paper enrollment form, Internet enrollment and telephonic enrollment, in the case of book-entry (i.e., Direct Registration System) securities. If Client has not appointed a banking affiliate of Agent to administer a direct stock purchase or dividend reinvestment plan, then Client hereby appoints and directs a banking affiliate of Agent to implement and administer a share selling program (\"Program\") pursuant to which shareholders may enroll book-entry Shares in the Program in order to liquidate them under the following terms and conditions. The Program transaction fee for each such sale shall be $15.00 plus $0.12 per Share. Under the Program, upon receipt of a sale request by a registered shareholder, Agent (on behalf of such banking affiliate) will process the request through an affiliated registered broker/dealer. Proceeds of each sale under the Program will be sent to the shareholder in the form of a check (less the transaction fee). Sale requests under the Program will typically be combined with other sale requests received from Client shareholders and Shares will be submitted in bulk to an affiliated registered broker/dealer for sale. Shares will be sold under the Program generally within one business day of Agent's receipt (on behalf of such banking affiliate) of the sale request, but in no event more than five business days (except where deferral is necessary under state or federal regulations). The price per Share received by the selling shareholder under the Program will equal the market price Agent (on behalf of such banking affiliate) receives for the Shares (or, if more than one bulk trade is executed on the day the Shares are sold, then the price per Share shall equal the weighted average market price received for all Shares sold that day).\n\nPrior Agent Out-of-Proof Conditions: If an out-of-proof condition exists on the Effective Date, and such condition is not resolved within 90 calendar days thereafter, Client agrees to provide Agent with funds or shares sufficient to resolve the out-of-proof condition promptly upon the expiration of such 90 day period.\n\nLost Certificates: Agent shall charge shareholders an administrative fee for replacement of lost certificates, which shall be charged only once in instances where a single surety bond obtained covers multiple certificates. Agent may receive compensation from surety companies or surety agents for administrative services provided to them.\n\nLegal Expenses, System Modifications: Certain expenses may be incurred in resolving legal matters, including receiving and responding to routine subpoenas that arise in the course of performing services hereunder. This may result in a separate charge to cover Agent's expenses (including the cost of external or internal counsel) in resolving such matters; provided that any legal expenses charged to the Client shall be reasonable.\n\nIn the event any federal, state or local laws, rules or regulations are enacted that require Agent to (i) make any adjustments and/or modifications to its current system, or (ii) B-7\n\n\n\n\n\nprovide additional services to Client for which Agent is not being compensated hereunder, then Client shall compensate Agent (a) on a pro rata basis proportionate to the Client's registered shareholder base, for the costs associated with making such required adjustments and/or modifications, or (b) according to Agent's standard fees established, in good faith, with respect to such additional services.\n\nInitial Compliance Escheatment Services: If, at the time escheat services are commenced for any asset type, Client is not in compliance with applicable state unclaimed property regulations with respect to that asset type, then Agent shall provide initial compliance services, which shall include working with one or more state unclaimed property clearinghouses to identify specific reportable records and property, and organizing and formatting such records and property for remittance to the applicable states, as required. Where applicable, in concert with state clearinghouses, Agent shall also attempt to obtain releases and indemnification agreements protecting Client from interest and penalties that may be assessable against Client by the states for prior non-compliance. If a release or indemnification agreement is not so obtained from a state, Client may be responsible for interest and/or penalties from such state for prior non-compliance. Agent may receive compensation from state clearinghouses for the processing and support services it provides to them in connection with initial compliance services.\n\nCash Dividends and Distributions: For any dividend mailing, Client shall, no later than 10 am Eastern Time on the mail date for the dividend, provide to Agent immediately available funds sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of cash dividends to be paid. Upon receipt of any such funds, Agent shall (a) in the case of registered shareholders who are participants in a dividend reinvestment plan of Client as of the record date, reinvest such funds in accordance with the terms of such plan, and (b) in the case of registered shareholders who are not participants in any such plan as of the record date, make payment of such funds to such shareholders by mailing a check, payable to the registered shareholder, to the address of record or, if different, dividend mailing address. If Agent has not timely received sufficient funds to make payments of any dividend or distribution pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) above to all registered shareholders of Client as of the record date, Agent shall notify Client and withhold all payments until Client has provided sufficient funds to Agent.\n\nOther Services: Fees, out of pocket expenses and disbursements for any services, including, but not limited to, down posting for odd lots, provided to Client or any of its agents or representatives by or on behalf of Agent hereunder that are not set forth above will be based on Agent's standard fees at the time such services are provided or, if no standard fees have been established, an appraisal of the work to be performed. B-8\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit C\n\nDOCUMENTS AND NOTIFICATIONS TO BE DELIVERED TO AGENT\n\nPrior to the Effective Date, to the extent not previously provided by Client to Agent, Client shall provide Agent with the following: 1.

It is more likely than not that: (1) PHLVIC will not be treated as the owner of the assets in an ICC Account for  federal income tax purposes; (2) the GIE, including each Certificate, will be treated as an annuity contract for federal income tax  purposes; however, if the value of an ICC Account happens to be greater than zero when an Owner's life expectancy is less  than one year (which will only occur at extremely advanced ages), it is possible that the Policy could be treated as no longer  constituting an annuity contract for Federal tax purposes from that point on; (3) for all Certificate Holders on the date of GIE  issuance and during the entire period during which the GIE and each Certificate is in effect, losses with respect to the ICC  Account will be deductible under Section 165(a) of the IRC notwithstanding the existence of the GIE' conditional guarantee of  annual lifetime income payments in the event that the value of the assets in an ICC Account decreases to zero; (4) for all  Certificate Owners on the date of GIE issuance and during the entire period during which the GIE and each Certificate is in  effect, dividends on stock held in an ICC Account otherwise meeting the requirements of Section 1(h)(11) of the IRC will  constitute qualified dividend income notwithstanding the existence of a GIE and its conditional guarantee of annual lifetime  income payments in the event the value of the assets in the ICC Account decreases to zero; and (5) for each Certificate Owner  on the date of Certificate issuance and during the entire period during which the GIE and each Certificate is in effect, the  Certificate and assets in the ICC Account subject thereto will not be treated as a straddle under Section 1092 of the IRC.\n\n\n\n4.11 Ownership of GIE; No Claims Relating to GIE. Except as set forth in Section 10.01, PHLVIC and its Affiliates, as applicable, are  the exclusive legal and beneficial owner of and have good and marketable title in and to the GIE and all intellectual property  rights therein, free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or character,  including any claims for infringement of intellectual property rights.

SUCH OMITTED PORTIONS, WHICH ARE MARKED WITH BRACKETS [ ] AND AN ASTERISK*, HAVE BEEN SEPARATELY FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. Exhibit 10.1 EXECUTION COPY   COOPERATION AGREEMENT   This AGREEMENT, dated as of June 27, 2017 (this \"Agreement\"), is made and entered into by The Meet Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the \"Company\"), and each of the persons set forth on the signature page hereto (each, an \"Investor\" and collectively, the \"Investors\" or, with their respective affiliates and associates, the \"Investor Group\"), which presently are or may be deemed to be members of a \"group\" with respect to the common stock of the Company, $0.001 par value per share (the \"Common Stock\"), pursuant to Rule 13d-5 promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\");   WHEREAS, the Investor Group is deemed to beneficially own shares of the Common Stock totaling, in the aggregate, 4,425,000 shares of the Common Stock outstanding as of the date hereof; and   WHEREAS, the Company has agreed, at the request of the Investor Group, to cause Jim Parmelee (\"New Director A\") and a person to be selected from the Director Candidate Pool (as defined herein) (\"New Director B\") (collectively, the \"New Directors\") to be appointed to the Company's Board of Directors (the \"Board\"), and to come to an agreement with respect to certain other matters as provided in this Agreement.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:   1. Board Composition Matters.    (a) Appointment of New Director A. The Company agrees that it shall take all action as is necessary (including, without limitation, calling a special meeting of the Board to approve all actions contemplated hereby), effective immediately following the execution of this Agreement, to (i) cause the Board to increase the size of its membership from six (6) to seven (7) members; (ii) accept the resignation of one existing member of the Board to become effective immediately prior to the appointment of New Director A; and (iii) appoint New Director A to the Board with a term on the Board expiring at the Company's 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the \"2018 Annual Meeting\") and until his successor is duly elected and qualified. The Company further agrees that without the unanimous approval of the Board, during the period from the execution of this Agreement until the expiration of the Standstill Period (as defined below), the size of the Board shall not be increased beyond seven (7) members.\n\n\n\n\n\n    (i) Identification and Appointment of New Director B. No later than ninety (90) calendar days from the date of execution of this Agreement (the \"New Director B Appointment Deadline\"), the Company shall take the necessary steps to cause the Board to appoint one of the candidates set forth on Exhibit A (as the same may be supplemented or otherwise amended from time to time by the mutual constent of the Company and the Investor Group, the \"Director Candidate Pool\") as New Director B with a term on the Board expiring at the 2018 Annual Meeting and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified. The Company agrees that, if New Director B is not appointed to the Board prior to the New Director B Appointment Deadline and none of the candidates included in the Director Candidate Pool are willing to serve on the Board by the New Director B Appointment Deadline, (1) the Company and Investor Group will discuss in good faith the identification and selection of a mutually agreed upon substitute person to be added to the Director Candidate Pool following the same process that they would follow pursuant to Section 1(f) hereof if either of the New Directors, following their appointment to the Board, is unable to serve as a director for any reason, resigns as a director, or is removed as a director prior to the end of the term of office; and (2) the New Director B Appointment Deadline shall no longer apply and, in lieu thereof, shall be replaced by the time periods set forth in Section 1(f) hereof.   (b) Board's Review of Qualifications and Determination of Independence. Prior to the execution of this Agreement (i) the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board (the \"Nominating Committee\") has reviewed the qualifications of New Director A and each of the individuals included within the Director Candidate Pool to serve as members of the Board and has determined that they are so qualified, and (ii) the Board has determined that each of the New Directors and each of the individuals included within the Director Candidate Pool are \"independent\" as defined by the listing standards of NASDAQ.   (c) Committees. The Company agrees that, concurrent with the appointment of the New Directors to the Board, the Board shall take such action as is necessary such that each of the New Directors is appointed to at least one (1) of the three (3) standing committees of the Board that the Company is required to maintain in accordance with the NASDAQ listing standards; provided that, with respect to each such committee appointment, the New Director is and continues to remain eligible to serve as a member of such committee pursuant to applicable law and the rules of NASDAQ that are applicable to the composition of such committee.   (d) Board Policies and Procedures. The Investor Group acknowledges that each of the New Directors shall be required to comply with all policies, processes, procedures, codes, rules, standards, and guidelines applicable to members of the Board, as in effect from time to time, including, but not limited to, the Company's Code of Conduct, and policies on confidentiality, ethics, hedging and pledging of Company securities, public disclosures, stock trading, and stock ownership, and that each of the New Directors shall be required to strictly preserve the confidentiality of Company business and information, including the discussion of any matters considered in meetings of the Board whether or not the matters relate to material non-public information, unless previously publicly disclosed by the Company. Further, the Investor Group acknowledges that the New Directors will be requested to provide the Company with such information as is reasonably requested by the Company concerning the New Directors as is required to be disclosed under applicable law or stock exchange regulations, including the completion of the Company's standard director and officer questionnaire, in each case as promptly as necessary to enable the timely filing of the Company's proxy statement and other periodic reports with the SEC.     2\n\n\n\n\n\n    (e) Rights and Benefits of the New Directors. The Company agrees that each of the New Directors shall receive (i) the same benefits of director and officer insurance, and any indemnity and exculpation arrangements available generally to the directors on the Board, (ii) the same compensation for his service as a director as the compensation received by other non-management directors on the Board, and (iii) such other benefits on the same basis as all other non-management directors on the Board.   (f) Replacements. The Company agrees that, during the Standstill Period (as defined below), if any of the New Directors is unable to serve as a director for any reason, resigns as a director, or is removed as a director prior to the end of the term of office, and at such time the Investor Group beneficially owns in the aggregate at least three percent (3.0%) of the Company's then outstanding Common Stock (subject to adjustment for share issuances, stock splits, reclassifications, combinations and similar actions by the Company that increase the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock), then the Company and the Investor Group shall work together in good faith to identify and select a replacement director candidate to be appointed to the Board which shall only be appointed to the Board after having been mutually agreed upon by both the Company and the Investor Group. Any such mutually agreed upon replacement director candidate shall qualify as \"independent\" pursuant to NASDAQ's listing standards and have the relevant financial and business experience to fill the resulting vacancy. Each of the Investor Group and the Company shall determine, and inform the other party of its determination, whether any proposed replacement director candidate is acceptable and meets the foregoing criteria, within ten (10) business days after such party has conducted interview(s) of such proposed replacement director candidate. Each of the Company and the Investor Group shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause any interview(s) contemplated by this Section 1(f) to be conducted as promptly as practicable, but in any case, assuming reasonable availability of the proposed replacement director candidate, within ten (10) business days after the receipt of such director candidate's credentials, including, but not limited to, a completed copy of the Company's standard director and officer questionnaire. Upon acceptance of a replacement director candidate by both the Company and the Investor Group, the Board shall take such actions as to appoint such replacement director candidate to the Board no later than ten (10) business days after both parties have confirmed in writing that they have mutually agreed upon such candidate. Following the appointment of any director to replace a New Director in accordance with this Section 1(f), any reference to New Directors herein shall be deemed to include such replacement director.     3\n\n\n\n\n\n    2. Actions by the Investor Group.   (a) Voting Agreement.   (i) Stockholders Meetings.

Standstill.   (a) Each Investor agrees that, from the date of this Agreement until the expiration of the Standstill Period (as defined below), without the prior written consent of a majority of the Board specifically expressed in a written resolution, neither it nor any of its Related Persons (as defined herein) will, and it will cause each of its Related Persons not to, directly or indirectly, alone or with others, in any manner:   (i) propose or publicly announce or otherwise publicly disclose an intent to propose or enter into or agree to enter into, singly or with any other person, directly or indirectly, (x) any form of business combination or acquisition or other transaction relating to a material amount of assets or securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (y) any form of restructuring, recapitalization or similar transaction with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (z) any form of tender or exchange offer for the Common Stock, whether or not such transaction involves a change of control of the Company;

provided, however, that for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not prevent any Investor from (A) bringing litigation to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, (B) making counterclaims with respect to any proceeding initiated by, or on behalf of, the Company against an Investor, or (C) exercising statutory dissenters, appraisal or similar rights under the DGCL;

  (xviii) make any request or submit any proposal to amend the terms of this Agreement other than through non-public communications with the Company that would not be reasonably determined to trigger public disclosure obligations for any party;

For the avoidance of doubt, no provision in this Section 3 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit privately-negotiated transactions in the Common Stock solely between or among the Investors.   (c) As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Investors are engaged in any discussions or negotiations with any person, and do not have any agreements, arrangements, or understandings, written or oral, formal or informal, and whether or not legally enforceable with any person concerning the acquisition of economic ownership of any securities of the Company, and have no actual and non-public knowledge that any other stockholders of the Company have any present or future intention of taking any actions that if taken by the Investors would violate any of the terms of this Agreement. The Investors agree to refrain from taking any actions during the Standstill Period to intentionally encourage other stockholders of the Company, or any other persons to engage in any of the actions referred to in the previous sentence.
