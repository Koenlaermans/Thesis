Our System includes (among other things): business processes, technologies, trade secrets, customer lists, knowledge, know-how, trade names, service marks, trademarks, logos, emblems, trade dress and other intellectual property; distinctive signage; standards, specifications and sources for services, products, supplies, appearance, operations and management control; safety standards; training and assistance; purchasing programs; and advertising, marketing, promotional and sales programs; all of which we may periodically change, discontinue, improve, modify and further develop.\n\nWe identify the System by means of our Proprietary Marks. Our proprietary marks include certain trade names (for example, the mark \"Goosehead Insurance\" and logo), service marks, trademarks, logos, emblems, and indicia of origin, as well as other trade names, service marks, and trademarks that we may periodically specify in writing for use in connection with the System (all of these are referred to as our \"Proprietary Marks\"). We continue to develop, use, and control the use of our Proprietary Marks in order to identify for the public the source of services and products marketed under those marks and under the System, and to represent the System's high standards of quality, appearance, and service.\n\nWe are in the business of developing and awarding franchise rights to third party franchisees, such as you, to develop and operate businesses providing insurance services (\"Services\") to clients under the System and using the Proprietary Marks (\"Goosehead Businesses\").\n\nYou have asked to enter into the business of operating a Goosehead Business under our System and wish to obtain a franchise from us for that purpose, as well as to receive the training and other assistance we provide as described in this Agreement. You also understand and acknowledge the importance of our high standards of quality, appearance, and service and the necessity of operating the business franchised under this Agreement in conformity with our standards and specifications.\n\nYou will be in the business of operating a Goosehead Business, using the same brand and Proprietary Marks as other independent businesses that operate other Goosehead Businesses under the System. We will not operate your Goosehead Business for you, although we have (and will continue) to set standards for Goosehead Businesses that you will have chosen to adopt as yours by signing this Agreement and by your day-to-day management of your Goosehead Business to our brand standards.\n\nPage 1 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recognition of all of the details noted above, the parties have chosen to enter into this Agreement, taking into account all of the promises and commitments that they are each making to one another in this contract, and for other good and valuable consideration (the sufficiency and receipt of which they hereby acknowledge) and they agree as follows: 1 GRANT 1.1 Rights and Obligations. We grant you the right, and you accept the obligation, all under the terms (and subject to the conditions) of this Agreement: 1.1.1 To operate one Goosehead Business under the System (the \"Franchised Business\"); 1.1.2 To use the Proprietary Marks and the System, but only in connection with the Franchised Business (recognizing that we may periodically change or improve the Proprietary Marks and the System); and 1.1.3 To do all of those things only at the Approved Location (as defined in Section 1.2 below). 1.2 Approved Location. The street address of the location for the Franchised Business approved under this Agreement is specified in Exhibit A to this Agreement, and is referred to as the \"Approved Location.\" 1.2.1 When this Agreement is signed, if you have not yet obtained (and we have not yet approved in writing) a location for the Franchised Business, then you agree to enter into the site selection addendum (the \"Site Selection Addendum,\" attached as Exhibit G to this Agreement) at the same time as you sign this Agreement. You will then find a site which will become the Approved Location after we have given you our written approval for that site and you have obtained the right to occupy the premises, by lease, sublease, or acquisition of the property, all subject to our prior written approval and in accordance with the Site Selection Addendum. 1.2.2 We have the right to grant or withhold approval of the Approved Location under this Section 1.2. You understand, acknowledge, and agree that our review and approval of your proposed location, under this Section 1.2 or pursuant to the Site Selection Addendum, does not constitute our assurance, representation, or warranty of any kind that your Franchised Business at the Approved Location will be profitable or successful (as further described in Section 5 of the Site Selection Addendum). 1.2.3 You agree not to relocate the Franchised Business without our prior written consent. Any proposed relocation will be subject to our review of the proposed new site under our then-current standards for site selection, and we will also have the right to take into consideration any commitments we have given to other franchisees, licensees, landlords, and other parties relating to the proximity of a new Goosehead Business to their establishment. You must pay us a fee in the amount of Five Hundred Dollars ($500) at the time you request the relocation of the Franchised Business. 1.3 No Protected Territory. You expressly acknowledge and agree that this franchise is non-exclusive, and that this Agreement does not grant or imply any protected area or territory for the Franchised Business. Accordingly, we retain the right to conduct any business and sell\n\nPage 2 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nservices and products at any location, notwithstanding the proximity of that business activity to the Approved Location. We retain all rights, including but not limited to: (a) the right to use, and to license others to use, the System and the Proprietary Marks for the operation of Goosehead Businesses at any location; (b) the right to sell, and to license others to sell, products and services (including Services) that are also authorized for sale at Goosehead Businesses through other channels of distribution (including, but not limited to, through catalogs, mail order, toll free numbers, sales via Internet websites, and other forms of electronic commerce); (c) the right to acquire and operate businesses of any kind and to grant or franchise the right to others to operate other businesses of any kind, no matter where located; and (d) the right to use and license the use of the Proprietary Marks and other marks in connection with the operation of businesses at any location, which businesses and marks may be the same as, similar to, or different from the Franchised Business and the Proprietary Marks, on such terms and conditions as we deem advisable, and without granting you any rights therein. 1.4 Limits on Where You May Operate. 1.4.1 You may offer and sell Services only: (a) in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement and the procedures set out in the Manual (defined below); and (b) to customers of the Franchised Business. 1.4.2 You agree not to offer or sell any services or products (including the Services and Products) through any means other than through the Franchised Business as provided in this Section 1.4; and therefore, for example, you agree not to offer or sell services or products from satellite locations, temporary locations, mobile vehicles or formats, carts or kiosks. Unless you become licensed in another state and receive prior written approval from us to offer insurance policies in that state, you may only provide and deliver Services to customers located within the State in which the Approved Location is situated. 2 TERM AND RENEWAL 2.1 Term. The term of this Agreement starts on the Effective Date and, unless this Agreement is earlier terminated in accordance with its provisions, will expire ten (10) years from the Effective Date. 2.2 Renewal. You will have the right to renew your rights to operate the Franchise Business for two (2) additional successor terms of five (5) years, so long as you have satisfied all of the conditions specified in Sections 2.2.1 through 2.2.10 before each such renewal: 2.2.1 You agree to give us written notice of your choice to renew at least six (6) months before the end of the term of this Agreement (but not more than nine (9) months before the term expires). 2.2.2 You agree to remodel and refurbish the Franchised Business to comply with our then-current standards in effect for new Goosehead Businesses (as well as the provisions of Sections 8.9 and 8.10 below). 2.2.3 At the time of renewal, you must be in material compliance with the provisions of this Agreement (including any amendment to this Agreement), any successor to this Agreement, and/or any other contract between you (and your affiliates) and us (and our affiliates), and in our reasonable judgment, you must have been in material compliance during the term of this Agreement, even if we did not issue a notice of\n\nPage 3 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\ndefault or exercise our right to terminate this Agreement if you did not meet your obligations. 2.2.4 You must have timely met all of your financial obligations to us, our affiliates, the Brand Fund, and/or the Regional Fund, as well as your vendors, throughout the term of this Agreement (even if we did not issue a notice of default or exercise our right to terminate this Agreement if you did not meet your obligations). 2.2.5 You must sign our then-current form of franchise agreement, which will supersede this Agreement in all respects (except with respect to the renewal provisions of the new franchise agreement, which will not supersede this Section 2), and which you acknowledge and agree may contain terms, conditions, obligations, rights, and other provisions that are substantially and materially different from those spelled out in this Agreement (including, for example, a higher percentage royalty fee and marketing contribution). If you are an entity, then your direct and indirect owners must also sign and deliver to us a personal guarantee of your obligations under the renewal form of franchise agreement. (In this Agreement, the term \"entity\" includes a corporation, limited liability company, partnership, and a limited liability partnership.) 2.2.6 You agree to sign and deliver to us a release, in a form that we will provide (which will be a mutual release with limited exclusions), which will release all claims against us and our affiliates, and our respective officers, directors, members, managers, agents, and employees. If you are an entity, then your affiliates and your direct and indirect owners (and any other parties that we reasonably request) must also sign and deliver that release to us. 2.2.7 You and your personnel must meet our then-current qualification and training requirements. 2.2.8 You agree to present to us satisfactory evidence that you have the right to remain in possession of the Approved Location for the duration of the renewal term of this Agreement. 2.2.9 You must be current with respect to your financial and other obligations to your lessor, suppliers, and all other parties with whom you do business. 3 OUR DUTIES 3.1 Training.

We have the right to periodically modify the layout and specifications as we deem appropriate.

We will receive all Commissions (defined below) from insurance carriers. We will receive all Premiums (defined below), Policy Fees (defined below) and Agency Fees on your behalf. If the event that any Premiums, Policy Fees, or Agency Fees are received directly by you, these funds must be forwarded to us within twenty four (24) hours of receipt. We will retain Agency Fees and will forward Premiums and Policy Fees to the insurance carriers. Beginning on the date you begin operations under this Agreement, which is agreed to be the date set out in the Declarations Page (the \"Commencement Date\"), we will remit to you Net Revenues on a monthly basis. As used in this Agreement: 4.2.1 the term \"Agency Fees\" will mean fees that are charged by you for issuing a new policy pursuant to the Manual. 4.2.2 the term \"Commission\" will mean the total fees paid in cash to us, by insurance carriers as a percentage of the Premiums generated by insurance policies sold by the Franchised Business, on all new and renewal policies. 4.2.3 the term \"Gross Revenues\" means the amount of Commissions and Agency Fees received in cash, net of reversals of Commissions for policy cancellations or policy\n\nPage 6 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nchanges and net of Agency Fee refunds, for insurance services provided by the Franchised Business; Gross Revenues will not include any Premiums or Policy Fees collected by the Franchised Business on behalf of any insurance carrier. 4.2.4 The term \"Minimum Royalty\" means a minimum monthly Royalty Fee payment, beginning six (6) months after the Commencement Date, in the following amounts: Number of Months following the Commencement Date Amount of Monthly Minimum Royalty\n\nSix (6) to Eighteen (18) Six Hundred Dollars ($600) Nineteen (19) and for the remainder of the term of this Agreement One Thousand Dollars ($1,000)\n\n4.2.5 the term \"Month\" means a calendar month or such other four (4) to five (5) week period that we may designate (provided that there will not be more than 13 \"Months\" during any year); and 4.2.6 the term \"Net Revenues\" means Gross Revenues net of all amounts due to us under this Agreement, including, without limitation, Royalty Fees, Marketing Contributions (if applicable), Technology Fees, and payments due to us under the Promissory Note (if applicable). 4.2.7 the term \"Premiums\" will mean fees that are paid to the insurance carrier for insurance coverage. 4.2.8 the term \"Policy Fees\" will mean fees to be paid to the insurance carrier for the issuance of a policy. 4.2.9 the term \"Royalty Fee\" is charged in consideration of you and your Managers' and Producers' use of our business processes, ongoing carrier relationships, trade secrets, know-how, trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, emblems, trade dress, intellectual property, and back office support functions. The Royalty Fee will be the following amounts: (a) the greater of (i) twenty percent (20%) of Gross Revenues on insurance policies in their initial term, or (ii) the Minimum Royalty (defined below); and (b) fifty percent (50%) of Gross Revenues on policies in their renewal terms and policies written for existing customers on the same risk profile within a one-year period of the cancellation of their existing policy (also known as \"re-writes\"). 4.2.10 The \"Technology Fee\" will be an amount necessary to reimburse us for our costs of providing Required Software (defined in Section 14 below) to you. The Technology Fee may vary during the term of this Agreement, and we have the right to adjust the amount of the Technology Fee to account for our increased or decreased costs, separate from the Index. 4.3 Monthly Accounting. Once a Month, the insurance carriers will send a commission report and Commissions earned by you, to us. On the 25th day of each Month, unless this Agreement has been terminated for any reason, we will pay to you the Net Revenues for all policies identified in a commission detail report that we receive from the insurance carrier. Please\n\nPage 7 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nnote that we expect each insurance carrier to submit commission detail reports on a Monthly basis for all policies written during the preceding Month by no later than the 20th day of the subsequent Month. But, if a carrier does not provide us with a commission detail report (and the applicable Commission) by the 20th day of the Month, or if a policy is not identified in the commission detail report we receive, you will not receive the Gross Revenues for those policies until the insurance carrier provides us with the appropriate report and/or Commissions. We may delay or withhold payment of Net Revenues \u2014 on a policy by policy basis \u2014 for any policy for which you fail to observe the risk management procedures we prescribe in the Manual, including that you obtain a signed application from the customer and provide all required documentation. If we review your accounting and client records (as described in Section 12 below) and find that you have not forwarded to us any Premiums, Policy Fees and/or Agency Fees that you collect, we may pay the appropriate Premiums and Policy Fees to the insurance carrier. You will be responsible for reimbursing us for those amounts and the applicable Agency Fees, in addition to paying a fee to us to cover our reasonable expenses in processing those payments and interest on those amounts, at the rate of two percent (2%) per Month, or if less, the maximum rate permitted by law. Entitlement to such interest will be in addition to any other remedies we may have. 4.3.1 You agree to deliver to us all of the reports, statements, and/or other information that is required under Section 12 below, at the time and in the format that we reasonably request. 4.3.2 You agree to establish an arrangement for electronic funds transfer to us, or electronic deposit to us of any payments required under this Agreement. Among other things, to implement this point, you agree to sign and return to us our current form of \"ACH\u2014Authorization Agreement for Prearranged Payments (Direct Debits),\" a copy of which is attached to this Agreement as Exhibit D (and any replacements for that form that we deem to be periodically needed to implement this Section 4.3.2), and you agree to; (a) comply with the payment and reporting procedures that we may specify in the Manual or otherwise in writing; and (b) maintain an adequate balance in your bank account at all times to pay by electronic means the charges that you owe under this Agreement. If we elect to use ACH withdrawal to sweep payment of fees, then you will not be required to submit a separate payment to us unless you do not maintain sufficient funds to pay the full amount due. 4.3.3 You acknowledge and agree that your obligations to make full and timely payment of Royalty Fees and Marketing Contributions (and all other sums due to us) are absolute, unconditional, fully-earned (by us), and due when you are open and in operation. 4.3.4 You agree that you will not, for any reason, delay or withhold the payment of any amount due to us under this Agreement; put into escrow any payment due to us; set-off payments due to us against any claims or alleged claims that you may allege against us, the Brand Fund, a Regional Fund, affiliates, suppliers, or others. We reserve the right to apply any monies received from you to any of your obligations as we determine and to withhold payment of any monies if this Agreement has been terminated for any reason. You acknowledge and agree that we have the right to set-off as part of Net Revenues any amounts you owe to us. 4.3.5 You agree that if you do not provide us, as requested, with access to your computer system to obtain sales information or, if we require pursuant to Section 12.1.4 below or otherwise, printed and signed sales reports, then we will have the right to impute your sales for any period using (among other things) your sales figures from any\n\nPage 8 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nMonth(s) that we choose (which may be those with your highest grossing sales), and that you agree to pay the royalties on that amount (whether by check or by our deduction of that amount from your direct debit account). 4.3.6 You agree that you will not, whether on grounds of alleged non-performance by us or others, withhold payment of any fee, including, without limitation, Royalty Fees or Marketing Contributions, nor withhold or delay submission of any reports due under this Agreement. 4.4 No Subordination. You agree: (a) not to subordinate to any other obligation your obligation to pay us the Royalty Fee and/or any other amount payable to us, whether under this Agreement or otherwise; and (b) that any such subordination commitment that you may give without our prior written consent will be null and void. 4.5 Late Payment. If we do not (or an applicable marketing fund does not) receive any payment due under this Agreement on or before the due date, then that amount will be deemed overdue. If any payment is overdue, then you agree to pay us, in addition to the overdue amount, interest on the overdue amount from the date it was due until paid, at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum (but not more than the maximum rate permitted by law, if any such maximum rate applies). Our entitlement to such interest will be in addition to any other remedies we may have. Any report that we do not receive on or before the due date will also be deemed overdue. 4.6 Other Funds Due. You agree to pay us, within ten (10) days of our written request (which is accompanied by reasonable substantiating material), any amounts that we have paid, that we have become obligated to pay, and/or that we choose to pay on your behalf. 4.7 Index. We have the right to adjust, for inflation, all fixed-dollar amounts under this Agreement (except for the Initial Franchise Fee) once a year to reflect changes in the Index from the year in which you signed this Agreement. For the purpose of this Section 4.8, the term \"Index\" means the Consumer Price Index (1982- 84=100; all items; CPI-U; all urban consumers) as published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (\"BLS\"). If the BLS no longer publishes the Index, then we will have the right to designate a reasonable alternative measure of inflation. 5 FRANCHISED BUSINESS LOCATION, CONSTRUCTION AND RENOVATION 5.1 Opening Deadline.

This Section 7 addresses those items. 7.1 Products. You agree to buy all products, equipment, furniture, supplies, materials and other products used or offered for sale at the Franchised Business only from suppliers as to whom we have given you our prior written approval (and whom we have not subsequently disapproved). In this regard, the parties further agree: 7.1.1 In determining whether we will approve any particular supplier, we will consider various factors, including: (a) whether the supplier can demonstrate, to our continuing reasonable satisfaction, the ability to meet our then-current standards and specifications for such items; (b) whether the supplier has adequate quality controls and capacity to supply your needs promptly and reliably; (c) whether approval of the supplier would enable the System, in our sole opinion, to take advantage of marketplace efficiencies; and (d) whether the supplier will sign a confidentiality agreement and a license agreement in the form that we may require (which may include a royalty fee for the right to use our Proprietary Marks and any other proprietary rights, recipes, and/or formulae).\n\nPage 13 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.2 For the purpose of  th is Agreement,  the term \"supplier\"  includes, but is not l imited to, manufacturers, insurance carriers, distributors, resellers, and other vendors. 7.1.3 Your Franchised Business will offer for sale only such insurance products and Services that conform to our specifications and quality standards and only through insurance carriers that we make available to you through our appointment process (\"Approved Products and Services\"). 7.1.4 You acknowledge and agree that we have the right to appoint only one supplier for Approved Products and Services (which may be us or one of our affiliates). 7.1.5 You may be required to use and/or offer for sale any of the Approved Products and Services that we designate. 7.1.6 You must maintain at all times an inventory of Approved Products and Services related to the Franchised Business's concept sufficient in quantity, quality and variety to realize your Franchised Business's full potential. 7.1.7 With regard to insurance products offered by you, the insurance carriers will set the policy prices, and we will set the Agency Fees. 7.1.8 If you want to buy any products, services or any item from an unapproved supplier, then you must first submit a written request to us asking for our prior written approval.

We also reserve the right, at our option, to periodically re-inspect the facilities and products of any such approved supplier and to revoke our approval if the supplier does not continue to meet any of our then-current criteria. We are not required to approve any particular supplier, nor to make available our standards, specifications, or formulas to prospective suppliers, which we have the right to deem confidential. 7.1.9 You agree we have the right to establish one or more strategic alliances or preferred vendor programs with one or more nationally or regionally-known suppliers that are willing to supply all or some Goosehead Businesses with some or all of the products and/or services that we require for use and/or sale in the development and/or operation of Goosehead Businesses, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement. In this event, we may limit the number of approved suppliers with whom you may deal, designate sources that you must use for some or all Products and other products and services, and/or refuse any of your requests if we believe that this action is in the best interests of the System or the network of Goosehead Businesses. We have the right to approve or disapprove of the suppliers who may be permitted to sell products to you. Any of our affiliates that sell products to you will do so at our direction. If you are in default of this Agreement, we reserve the right to direct our affiliates not to sell products to you, or to withhold certain discounts which might otherwise be available to you.\n\nPage 14 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.10 You acknowledge and agree that we have the right to collect and retain all manufacturing allowances, marketing allowances, rebates, contingencies, credits, monies, payments or benefits (collectively, \"Allowances\") offered by suppliers to you or to us (or our affiliates) based upon your purchases of Products and other goods and services.

Such umbrella liability must provide at a minimum those coverages and endorsements required in the underlying policies. 15.1.7 Property insurance providing coverage for direct physical loss or damage to real and personal property for all risk perils, including the perils of flood and earthquake. Appropriate coverage must also be provided for business interruption/extra expense exposures, written on an actual loss sustained basis. The policy or policies must value property (real and personal) on a new replacement cost basis without deduction for depreciation and the amount of insurance must not be less than 90% of the full replacement value of the Franchised Business, its furniture, fixtures, equipment, and stock (real and personal property). Any deductibles contained in such policy will be subject to our review and approval.\n\nPage 36 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\n15.1.8 If your Approved Location is located in a flood zone other than B, C or X, as determined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, you must also obtain flood insurance coverage in the amount of the lesser of 90% of the replacement cost or the maximum coverage available from the National Flood Insurance Program. 15.1.9 Any other insurance coverage that is required by federal, state, or municipal law. 15.2 Endorsements. All policies listed in Section 15.1 above (unless otherwise noted below) must contain such endorsements as will, periodically, be provided in the Manual. All policies must waive subrogation as between us (and our insurance carriers) and you (and your insurance carriers). 15.3 Notices to us. In the event of cancellation, material change, or non-renewal of any policy, sixty (60) days' advance written notice must be provided to us in the manner provided in Section 24 below. 15.4 Construction Coverages. In connection with all significant construction, reconstruction, or remodeling of the Franchised Business during the term of this Agreement, you agree to require the general contractor, its subcontractors, and any other contractor, to effect and maintain at general contractor's and all other contractor's own expense, such insurance policies and bonds with such endorsements as are set forth in the Manual, all written by insurance or bonding companies that we have approved, having a rating as set forth in Section 15.1 above. 15.5 Other Insurance Does Not Impact your Obligation. Your obligation to obtain and maintain the foregoing policy or policies in the amounts specified will not be limited in any way by reason of any insurance that we may maintain, nor will your performance of that obligation relieve you of liability under the indemnity provisions set forth in Section 21.4 below. Additionally, the requirements of this Section 15 will not be reduced, diminished, eroded, or otherwise affected by insurance that you carry (and/or claims made under that insurance) for other businesses, including other Goosehead Businesses that you (and/or your affiliates) operate under the System. 15.6 Additional Named Insured. All public liability and property damage policies except workers' compensation must list us as an additional named insured, and must also contain a provision that we, although named as an insured, will nevertheless be entitled to recover under said policies on any loss occasioned to us or our servants, agents, or employees by reason of the negligence of you or your servants, agents, or employees. 15.7 Certificates of Insurance. At least thirty (30) days before the time you are first required to carry any insurance under this Agreement, and from then on, at least thirty (30) days before the expiration of any such policy, you agree to deliver to us certificates of insurance evidencing the proper coverage with limits not less than those required under this Agreement. All certificates must expressly provide that we will receive at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice if there is a material alteration to, cancellation, or non-renewal of the coverages evidenced by such certificates. Additional certificates evidencing the insurance required by Section 15.1 above must name us, and each of our affiliates, directors, agents, and employees, as additional insured parties, and must expressly provide that any interest of same therein will not be affected by any breach by you of any policy provisions for which such certificates evidence coverage. 15.8 Proof of Coverage. In addition to your obligations under Section 15.7 above, on the first anniversary of the Effective Date, and on each subsequent anniversary of the Effective Date,\n\nPage 37 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nyou agree to provide us with proof of insurance evidencing the proper coverage with limits not less than those required under this Agreement, in such form as we may reasonably require. 15.9 Coverages are Minimums. You acknowledge and agree that the specifications and coverage requirements in this Section 15 are minimums, and that we recommend that you review these with your own insurance advisors to determine whether additional coverage is warranted in the operation of your Franchised Business. 15.10 Changes. We will have the right, periodically, to make such changes in minimum policy limits and endorsements as we may determine are necessary or appropriate; provided, however, all changes will apply to all of our franchisees who are similarly situated. 16 TRANSFER OF INTEREST 16.1 By Us. We will have the right to transfer or assign this Agreement and all or any part of our rights or obligations under this Agreement to any person or legal entity, and any assignee of us, which assignee will become solely responsible for all of our obligations under this Agreement from the date of assignment. 16.2 Your Principals. If you are an entity, then each party that directly or indirectly holds any interest whatsoever in you (each, a \"Principal\"), and the interest that each Principal directly or indirectly holds in you, is identified in Exhibit C to this Agreement. You represent and warrant to us, and agree, that your owners are accurately set forth on Exhibit C to this Agreement, and you also agree not to permit the identity of those owners, or their respective interests in you, to change without complying with this Agreement. 16.3 Principals. We will have a continuing right to designate any person or entity that owns a direct or indirect interest in you as a Principal, and Exhibit C will be so amended automatically upon written notice to you. 16.4 By You. You understand and acknowledge that the rights and duties set forth in this Agreement are personal to you, and that we have granted this franchise in reliance on your (or your Principals') business skill, financial capacity, and personal character. Accordingly: 16.4.1 You agree not to make a transfer (and not to permit any other party to make a transfer) without our prior written consent. 16.4.1.1 As used in this Agreement, the term \"transfer\" is agreed to mean any sale, assignment, conveyance, pledge, encumbrance, merger, creation of a security interest in, and/or giving away of any direct or indirect interest in: (a) this Agreement; (b) you; (c) any or all of your rights and/or obligations under this Agreement; and/or (d) all or substantially all of the assets of the Franchised Business. 16.4.1.2 Any purported assignment or transfer not having our prior written consent as required by this Section 16 will be null and void and will also constitute a material breach of this Agreement, for which we may immediately terminate this Agreement without opportunity to cure, pursuant to Section 17.2.5 below. 16.4.2 If you are an entity (other than a partnership or a limited liability partnership), then you agree that: (a) without our prior written approval, you will not issue any voting\n\nPage 38 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nsecurities or interests, or securities or interests convertible into voting securities; and (b) t he recipient of any such security or other interest will become a Principal under this Agreement, if we designate them as such. 16.4.3 If you are a partnership or limited liability partnership, then the partners of that partnership will not, without our prior written consent, admit additional general partners, remove a general partner, or otherwise materially alter the powers of any general partner. Each general partner in such a partnership will automatically be deemed to be a Principal. 16.4.4 Principals must not, without our prior written consent, transfer, pledge, and/or otherwise encumber their interest in you. 16.5 Transfer Conditions. We will not unreasonably withhold any consent required by Section 16.4 above; provided, that if you propose to transfer your obligations under this Agreement or any material asset, or if any party proposes to transfer any direct or indirect interest in you, then we will have the right to require that you satisfy any or all of the following conditions before we grant our approval to the proposed transfer: 16.5.1 The transferor must have executed a general release, in a form satisfactory to us, of any and all claims against us and our affiliates, successors, and assigns, and their respective officers, directors, members, managers, shareholders, partners, agents, representatives, servants, and employees in their corporate and individual capacities including, without limitation, claims arising under this Agreement, any other agreement between you and us, and/or our respective affiliates, and federal, state, and local laws and rules. 16.5.2 The transferee of a Principal will be designated as a Principal and each transferee who is designated a Principal must enter into a written agreement, in a form satisfactory to us, agreeing to be bound as a Principal under the terms of this Agreement as long as such person or entity owns any interest in you; and, if your obligations were guaranteed by the transferor, the Principal must guarantee the performance of all such obligations in writing in a form satisfactory to us. 16.5.3 The proposed new Principals (after the transfer) must meet our educational, managerial, and business standards; each must possess a good moral character, business reputation, and credit rating; have the aptitude and ability to operate the Franchised Business, as may be evidenced by prior related business experience or otherwise; and have adequate financial resources and capital to operate the Franchised Business. 16.5.4 We will have the right to require that the transferee execute, for a term ending on the expiration date of this Agreement, the form of franchise agreement that we are then offering to new System franchisees, and such other ancillary agreements that we may require for the business franchised under this Agreement, and those agreements will supersede this Agreement and its ancillary documents in all respects, and the terms of which may differ from the terms of this Agreement including, without limitation, a higher royalty and marketing fee. 16.5.5 If we request, then you must conduct Remodeling to conform to the then-current standards and specifications of new Goosehead Businesses then-being established in the System, and you agree to complete the upgrading and other requirements specified above in Section 8.8.2 within the time period that we specify.\n\nPage 39 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\n16.5.6 You agree to pay in full all of your monetary obligations to us and our affiliates, and to all vendors (whether arising under this Agreement or otherwise), and you must not be otherwise in default of any of your obligations under this Agreement (including your reporting obligations). 16.5.7 The transferor must remain liable for all of the obligations to us in connection with the Franchised Business that arose before the effective date of the transfer, and any covenants that survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement, and must execute any and all instruments that we reasonably request to evidence such liability. 16.5.8 A Principal of the transferee whom we designate to be a new Operating Principal, and those of the transferee's Managers and Producers as we may require, must successfully complete (to our satisfaction) all training programs that we require upon such terms and conditions as we may reasonably require (and while we will not charge a fee for attendance at such training programs, the transferee will be responsible for the salary and all expenses of the person(s) that attend training). 16.5.9 You agree to pay us a transfer fee to compensate us for our legal, accounting, training, and other expenses incurred in connection with the transfer. The transfer fee will be in an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of your Initial Franchise Fee if you complete a transfer (as defined in this Section) to another franchisee currently operating within the System with a manager that has successfully completed all of our training programs then in effect. If you complete a transfer (as defined in this Section) to an individual or entity not currently operating within the System, then the transfer fee shall be one hundred percent (100%) of your Initial Franchise Fee. If any party has engaged a broker with respect to the transfer, you must also pay (or ensure the buyer's payment of) any applicable commission to the broker in connection with the transfer. You are not required to pay to us a transfer fee (although you must reimburse us for the legal and accounting costs and expenses we incur) for the following transfers: (a) for the convenience of ownership, (b) to members of transferor's immediate family, or (c) to an individual employed by you in connection with the Franchised Business for at least twenty four (24) consecutive months before the transfer. The waiver of a transfer fee for certain transfers does not waive any other requirements of this Section 16, including, without limitation, the requirement that all transferees obtain our approval and meet our standards as described in Section 16.5.3 above. 16.5.10 The transferor must acknowledge and agree that the transferor will remain bound by the covenants contained in Sections 19.3 - 19.5 below. 16.5.11 If the transfer involves the sale of all or any part of your book of insurance business (including Commissions payable in connection with that business), then upon completion of the transfer this Agreement shall terminate and the transferee must enter into a new form of franchise agreement that we are then offering to new System franchisees, for a term ending on the expiration date of this Agreement, and such other ancillary agreements that we may require for the business franchised under this Agreement. 16.6 Death or Incapacity. Upon the death or mental incapacity of any person with an interest in this Agreement, in Franchisee, in the Franchised Business, or in all or substantially all of the assets of the Franchised Business:\n\nPage 40 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\n16.6.1 The executor, administrator, or personal representative of such person will transfer such interest to a third party approved by us within six (6) months after such death or mental incapacity. Such transfers, including, without limitation, transfers by devise or inheritance, will be subject to the same conditions as any inter vivos transfer. In the case of transfer by devise or inheritance, if the heirs or beneficiaries of any such person are unable to meet the conditions in this Section 16, the executor, administrator, or personal representative of the decedent will transfer the decedent's interest to another party approved by us within a reasonable time, which disposition will be subject to all the terms and conditions for transfers contained in this Agreement. If the interest is not disposed of within a reasonable time, we may terminate this Agreement, pursuant to Section 17.2 below. Any transfer subject to this section which is made in accordance with a succession plan approved in advance by us will be deemed approved for the purposes of this Section 16.6.1. We will not unreasonably withhold any approvals required by this Section 16.6; 16.6.2 We will have the right to take such steps as are necessary to manage the Franchised Business for your account until such time as a transfer can be completed pursuant to Section 16.6.1. You further grant to us the right to receive a reasonable fee for such services and reimbursement for our expenses in connection with such services. 16.6.3 Our Right to Purchase Business Upon Death or Incapacity. 16.6.3.1 After your death or mental incapacity (or your principal's death or mental incapacity if franchisee is an entity), if the transfer of interest described in Section 16.6.1 has not occurred within six (6) months after such death or mental incapacity, we will have the option, but not the obligation, to purchase your interest in the Franchised Business. Such interest may include all rights of yours under this Agreement and all rights of yours in the lists of customers, prospects and policyholders and all business records and information regarding those customers, prospects and policyholders, including the name and address of the applicant or policyholder and the date of expiration and policy limits of any insurance policy or renewal, rights to solicit the customers, prospects and policyholders for the sale of insurance products and renewal of policyholders' current policies, rights to new, renewal or other commissions and compensation from the insurance carriers or their agents, book of business, furniture, fixtures, equipment and the rights under the lease for the Approved Location. We may elect not to include the furniture, fixtures, equipment and the rights under the lease for the Approved Location in that purchase. If we intend to exercise this option, we will notify you (or your appropriate legal representative) within thirty (30) days of the date we learn of such death or mental incapacity. 16.6.3.2 For assets other than furniture, fixtures or equipment and the rights under the lease for the Approved Location, the purchase price will be an amount equal to one and one-half times the Commissions, net of Royalty Fees, received by the Franchised Business during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the closing of the purchase of the assets by us, but if we re-sell the assets purchased under this Section within six (6) months of our purchase, the purchase price will be calculated to be ninety percent (90%) of the price for which we re-sell the business (if more than the original purchase price). The purchase price will be reduced by any current and long-term liabilities of the Franchised Business assumed by us and any amounts due to us from you at the time of sale. The purchase price for\n\nPage 41 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nfurniture, fixtures, equipment and the rights under the lease for the Approved Location (if we elect to purchase these assets) will be the fair market value as you and we agree. If we and you (or your appropriate legal representative) cannot agree on the fair market value of such furniture, fixtures, equipment or the rights under the lease for the Approved Location, each party will select an independent appraiser who will each provide a written appraisal of such furniture, fixtures, equipment or rights under the lease for the Approved Location and we may elect to exercise the option granted hereunder by paying to you the average of the two appraisals. We will pay the purchase price to you in twelve (12) equal, monthly installments following the purchase, provided that you are in full compliance with the covenants contained in this Agreement. If, at any time during the twelve (12) months following our purchase of your assets, as described above, you breach any covenant contained in this Agreement (or any other agreement between you and us), our obligation to pay the monthly installments will immediately cease. 16.6.3.3 We may elect to exercise our option to purchase your interest in the Franchised Business by sending written notice of the election to you (or your appropriate legal representative). The election may exclude the purchase of the furniture, fixtures, equipment and rights under the lease for the Approved Location. The closing of the sale will occur within thirty (30) days after we exercise our option to purchase the Franchised Business or such later date as may be necessary to comply with applicable bulk sales or similar laws. At closing, we and you agree to sign and deliver all documents necessary to vest title in the assets purchased by us free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, except any assumed by us and/or to effectuate assignment of the lease for the Approved Location. You (or your appropriate legal representative) must cooperate fully and use your best efforts to acquire the landlord's approval of the assignment of the lease for the Approved Location to us, if necessary. If the lease for the Approved Location cannot be assigned to us, you will agree to sublease the Approved Location to us on all the same terms and conditions as are contained in your lease and will cooperate fully and use your best efforts to acquire the landlord's approval of the sublease, if necessary. We reserve the right to assign our option to purchase the Franchised Business or designate a substitute purchaser of the Franchised Business. 16.7 Consent to Transfer. Our consent to a transfer that is the subject of this Section 16 will not constitute a waiver of any claims that we may have against the transferring party, nor will it be deemed a waiver of our right to demand exact compliance with any of the terms of this Agreement by the transferor or transferee. 16.8 No Transfers to a Non-Franchisee Party to Operate a Similar Business. You agree that neither you nor any Principal of yours will transfer or attempt to transfer any or all of your Franchised Business to a third party who will operate a similar business at the Approved Location but not under the System and the Proprietary Marks, and not under a franchise agreement with us. 16.9 Bankruptcy Issues. If you or any person holding any interest (direct or indirect) in you become a debtor in a proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any similar law in the U.S. or elsewhere, it is the parties' understanding and agreement that any transfer of you, your obligations, and/or rights under this Agreement, any material assets of yours, and/or\n\nPage 42 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nany indirect or direct interest in you will be subject to all of the terms of this Section 16, including without limitation the terms of Sections 16.4, 16.5, and 16.6 above. 16.10 Securities Offers. All materials for an offering of stock, ownership, and/or partnership interests in you or any of your affiliates that are required by federal or state law must be submitted to us for review as described below before such materials are filed with any government agency. Any materials to be used in any exempt offering must be submitted to us for such review before their use. 16.10.1 You agree that: (a) no offering by you or any of your affiliates may imply (by use of the Proprietary Marks or otherwise) that we are participating in an underwriting, issuance, or offering of your securities or your affiliates; (b) our review of any offering will be limited solely to the relationship between you and us (and, if applicable, any of your affiliates and us); and (c) we will have the right, but not obligation, to require that the offering materials contain a written statement that we require concerning the limitations stated above. 16.10.2 You (and the offeror if you are not the offering party), your Principals, and all other participants in the offering must fully indemnify us and all of the Franchisor Parties (as defined in Section 21.5.2 below) in connection with the offering. 16.10.3 For each proposed offering, you agree to pay us a non-refundable fee of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000) or such greater amount as is necessary to reimburse us for our reasonable costs and expenses (including legal and accounting fees) for reviewing the proposed offering. 16.10.4 You agree to give us written notice at least thirty (30) days before the date that any offering or other transaction described in this Section 16.11 commences. Any such offering will be subject to all of the other provisions of this Section 16, including without limitation the terms set forth in Sections 16.4, 16.5, 16.6; and further, without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any such offering will be subject to our approval as to the structure and voting control of the offeror (and you, if you are not the offeror) after the financing is completed. 16.10.5 You also agree that after your initial offering, described above, for the remainder of the term of the Agreement, you will submit to us for our review and prior written approval all additional securities documents (including periodic reports, such as quarterly, annual, and special reports) that you prepare and file (or use) in connection with any such offering. You agree to reimburse us for our reasonable costs and expenses (including legal and accounting fees) that we incur in connection with our review of those materials. 17 DEFAULT AND TERMINATION 17.1 Automatic. If any one or more of the following events take place, then you will be deemed to be in default under this Agreement, and all rights granted in this Agreement will automatically terminate without notice to you: (a) if you become insolvent (meaning, you are unable to pay your debts as they fall due in the usual course of business) or make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; (b) if a bill in equity or other proceeding for the appointment of a receiver for you or another custodian for your business or assets is filed and consented to by you; (c) if a receiver or other custodian (permanent or temporary) of your assets or property, or any part thereof, is appointed by any court of competent jurisdiction; (d) if proceedings for a composition with creditors under any state or federal law is instituted by or against you;\n\nPage 43 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) if a final judgment remains unsatisfied or of record for thirty (30) days or longer (unless unappealed or a supersedeas bond is filed); (f) if you are dissolved; or if execution is levied against your business or property; (g) if suit to foreclose any lien or mortgage against the Franchised Business premises or equipment is instituted against you and not dismissed within thirty (30) days; and/or (h) if the real or personal property of your Franchised Business will be sold after levy thereupon by any sheriff, marshal, or constable. 17.2 With Notice. If any one or more of the following events occur, then you will be in default under this Agreement, and we will have the right to terminate this Agreement and all rights granted under this Agreement, without affording you any opportunity to cure the default, effective immediately upon the delivery of our written notice to you (in the manner provided in Section 24 below): 17.2.1 If you do not obtain an Approved Location for the Franchised Business within the time limits specified under the Site Selection Addendum, or if you do not construct and open the Franchised Business within the time limits specified in Sections 5.1 and 8.2 above, and within the requirements specified in Sections 5 and 8.2 above; 17.2.2 If you at any time cease to operate or otherwise abandon the Franchised Business for ten (10) consecutive business days (during which you are otherwise required to be open, and without our prior written consent to do so), or lose the right to possession of the premises, or otherwise forfeit the right to do or transact business in the jurisdiction where the Franchised Business is located (however, if through no fault of yours, the premises are damaged or destroyed by an event such that you cannot complete repairs or reconstruction within ninety (90) days thereafter, then you will have thirty (30) days after such event in which to apply for our approval to relocate and/or reconstruct the premises, which approval we will not unreasonably withhold); 17.2.3 If you or any of your Principals or Managers are convicted of a felony, a crime involving moral turpitude, or any other crime or offense that we believe is reasonably likely to have an adverse effect on the System, the Proprietary Marks, the goodwill associated therewith, or our interest therein; 17.2.4 If a threat or danger to public health or safety results from the construction, maintenance, or operation of the Franchised Business; 17.2.5 If you or any of your Principals purport to transfer any rights or obligations under this Agreement or any interest to any third party in a manner that is contrary to the terms of Section 16 above; 17.2.6 If you fail to comply with the requirements of Section 19 below; 17.2.7 If, contrary to the terms of Sections 10 or 11 above, you disclose or divulge the contents of the Manual or other confidential information that we provide to you; 17.2.8 If an approved transfer of an interest in you is not completed within a reasonable time, as required by Sections 16.7 above; 17.2.9 If you knowingly maintain false books or records, or submit any false reports (including information provided as part of your application for this franchise) to us;\n\nPage 44 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\n17.2.10 If you commit three (3) or more defaults under this Agreement in any fifty-two (52) week period, whether or not each such default has been cured after notice; 17.2.11 If, after receipt of notice from us, you continue to sell any products or services from the Franchised Business that are not Approved Products or Services; 17.2.12 If you engage in any conduct or practice that is fraudulent, unfair, unethical, or a deceptive practice, or if you allow any of your Producers to operate dishonestly or carelessly; 17.2.13 If you misuse or misappropriate login information for access to insurance carrier websites or databases 17.2.14 If an insurance carrier terminates your ongoing business relationship, for cause; 17.2.15 If you or your Manager fails to successfully complete any required training programs to our reasonable satisfaction; 17.2.16 If your Franchised Business uses or sells any Prohibited Products or Services; and/or 17.2.17 If you make any unauthorized or improper use of the Proprietary Marks, or if you or any of your Principals use the Proprietary Marks in a manner that we do not permit (whether under this Agreement and/or otherwise) or that is inconsistent with our direction, or if you or any of your Principals directly or indirectly contest the validity of our ownership of the Proprietary Marks, our right to use and to license others to use the Proprietary Marks, or seek to (or actually do) register any of our Proprietary Marks with any agency (public or private) for any purpose without our prior written consent to do so. 17.3 With Notice and Opportunity to Cure. 17.3.1 Except as otherwise provided above in Sections 17.1 and 17.2 above, if you are in default of your obligations under this Agreement or the Manual, then we may terminate this Agreement by giving you written notice of termination (in the manner provided under Section 24 below) stating the nature of the default at least thirty (30) days before the effective date of termination (or ten (10) days before the effective date of termination for (i) any failure to pay the Initial Franchise Fee or an installment thereof, or (ii) any failure to timely enter information into the agency management system as required by the Manual). You may, however, avoid termination by: (a) immediately initiating a remedy to cure such default; (b) curing the default to our satisfaction; and (c) promptly providing proof of the cure to us, all within the thirty (30) day period (or ten (10) day period, as applicable). If you do not cure any such default within the specified time (or such longer period as applicable law may require), then this Agreement will terminate without further notice to you effective immediately upon the expiration of the thirty (30) day period (or ten (10) day period, or such longer period as applicable law may require). 17.3.2 If you are in default under the terms of any other franchise agreement or other contract between you (and/or your affiliates) and us (and/or our affiliates), that will also constitute a default under Section 17.3.1 above.\n\nPage 45 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\n17.4 Bankruptcy. If, for any reason, this Agreement is not terminated pursuant to this Section 17, and the Agreement is assumed, or assignment of the same to any person or entity who has made a bona fide offer to accept an assignment of the Agreement is contemplated, pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, then notice of such proposed assignment or assumption, setting forth: (a) the name and address of the proposed assignee; and (b) all of the terms and conditions of the proposed assignment and assumption; must be given to us within twenty (20) days after receipt of such proposed assignee's offer to accept assignment of the Agreement; and, in any event, within ten (10) days before the date application is made to a court of competent jurisdiction for authority and approval to enter into such assignment and assumption. We will then have the prior right and option, to be exercised by notice given at any time before the effective date of such proposed assignment and assumption, to accept an assignment of the Agreement to us upon the same terms and conditions, and for the same consideration, if any, as in the bona fide offer made by the proposed assignee, less any brokerage commissions that may be payable by you out of the consideration to be paid by such assignee for the assignment of the Agreement. 17.5 Our Rights Instead of Termination. If we are entitled to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Sections 17.2 or 17.3 above, we will also have the right to take any lesser action instead of terminating this Agreement. 17.6 Reservation of Rights under Section 17.5. If any rights, options, or arrangements are terminated or modified in accordance with Section 17.5 above, such action will be without prejudice to our right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Sections 17.2 or 17.3 above, and/or to terminate any other rights, options or arrangements under this Agreement at any time thereafter for the same default or as a result of any additional defaults of the terms of this Agreement. 17.7 Damages. You agree that you will pay us all damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, discovery costs, and all other related expenses), that we incur as a result of any default by you under this Agreement and any other agreement between the parties (and their respective affiliates) (in addition to other remedies that we may have). 18 OBLIGATIONS UPON TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION\n\nUpon termination or expiration of this Agreement, all rights granted under this Agreement to you will forthwith terminate, and all of the following will take effect: 18.1 Cease Operation. You agree to: (a) immediately and permanently stop operating the Franchised Business; and (b) never directly or indirectly represent to the public that you are a present or former franchisee of ours. 18.2 Stop Using Marks and Intellectual Property. You agree to immediately and permanently cease to use, in any manner whatsoever, all aspects of the System, including any confidential methods, procedures and techniques associated with the System, the mark \"Goosehead Insurance\" and any and all other Proprietary Marks, distinctive forms, slogans, signs, symbols, and devices associated with the System, and any and all other intellectual property associated with the System. Without limiting the foregoing, you agree to stop making any further use of any and all signs, marketing materials, displays, stationery, forms, and any other articles that display the Proprietary Marks. 18.3 Cancel Assumed Names. You agree to take such action as may be necessary to cancel any assumed name or equivalent registration which contains the mark \"Goosehead Insurance\"\n\nPage 46 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nand any and all other Proprietary Marks, and/or any other service mark or trademark of ours, and you will give us evidence that we deem satisfactory to provide that you have complied with this obligation within five (5) days after termination or expiration of this Agreement. 18.4 Premises. We will have the right (but not the obligation) to require you to assign to us any interest that you (and/or your affiliates) may have in the lease or sublease for the ground upon which the Franchised Business is operated and/or for the building in which the Franchised Business is operated. 18.4.1 If we do not elect or if we are unable to exercise any option we may have to acquire the lease or sublease for the premises of the Franchised Business, or otherwise acquire the right to occupy the premises, you will make such modifications or alterations to the premises operated under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the changing of the telephone number) immediately upon termination or expiration of this Agreement as may be necessary to distinguish the appearance of said premises from that of other Goosehead Businesses, and must make such specific additional changes thereto as we may reasonably request for that purpose. In addition, you will cease use of all telephone numbers and any domain names, websites, e-mail addresses, and any other print and online identifiers, whether or not authorized by us, that you have while operating the Franchised Business, and must promptly execute such documents or take such steps necessary to remove reference to the Franchised Business from all trade or business directories, including online directories, or at our request transfer same to us. 18.4.2 If you fail or refuse to comply with all of the requirements of this Section 18.4, then we (or our designee) will have the right to enter upon the premises of the Franchised Business, without being guilty of trespass or any other tort, for the purpose of making or causing to be made such changes as may be required, at your cost, which expense you agree to pay upon demand. 18.5 Our Option to Buy Your Assets. Within thirty (30) days after expiration or non-renewal under this Agreement and/or default under your lease/sublease for the premises, we shall buy from you (and/or your affiliates) all assets of the Franchised Business. This includes all rights of yours in prospects and policyholders and all business records and information regarding those customers, prospects and policyholders, including the name and address of the applicant or policyholder and the date of expiration and policy limits of any insurance policy or renewal, rights to solicit the customers, prospects and policyholders for the sale of insurance products and renewal of policyholders' current policies, rights to new, renewal or other commissions and compensation from the insurance carriers or their agents, book of business, furniture, fixtures, and equipment. We may elect not to include the furniture, fixtures, equipment and the rights under the lease for the Approved Location in that purchase. We are not obligated to purchase the assets of the Franchised Business under any other circumstances, but we may offer to do so in our sole discretion. 18.5.1 For assets other than furniture, fixtures or equipment and the rights under the lease for the Approved Location, the purchase price will be an amount equal to one and one-half (1 1\u22152) times the Commissions, net of Royalty Fees, received by the Franchised Business during the twelve-month period immediately preceding the closing of the purchase of the assets by us. The purchase price will be reduced by any current and long-term liabilities of the Franchised Business assumed by us and any amounts due to us from you at the time of sale. The purchase price for furniture, fixtures, equipment and the rights under the lease for the Approved Location (if we elect to purchase these assets) will be the fair market value as you and we agree. If\n\nPage 47 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nwe and you cannot agree on the fair market value of such furniture, fixtures, equipment or the rights under the lease for the Approved Location, each party will select an independent appraiser who will each provide a written appraisal of such furniture, fixtures, equipment or rights under the lease for the Approved Location and we may elect to exercise the option granted hereunder by paying to you the average of the two appraisals. The total purchase price will be for the assets of the Franchised Business that we elect to purchase, which may not include the furniture, fixtures, equipment and rights under the lease for the Approved Location. We will pay the purchase price to you in twenty four (24) equal, monthly installments following the purchase, provided that you are in full compliance with the covenants contained in this Agreement. If, at any time during the twenty four (24) months following our purchase of your assets, as described above, you breach any covenant contained in this Agreement (or any other agreement between you and us), our obligation to pay the monthly installments will immediately cease. We have the right to offset amounts that you owe to us against any payment that we may be required to make pursuant to this Section 18.5. 18.5.2 The closing of the sale will occur within thirty (30) days after we exercise our option to purchase the Franchised Business or such later date as may be necessary to comply with applicable bulk sales or similar laws. At closing, we and you agree to sign and deliver all documents necessary to vest title in the assets purchased by us free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, except any assumed by us. We reserve the right to assign our repurchase rights described above or designate a substitute purchaser of the Franchised Business. 18.6 No Use of the Marks in Other Businesses. You agree, if you continue to operate or subsequently begin to operate any other business, that you will not use any reproduction, counterfeit copy, and/or colorable imitation of the Proprietary Marks, either in connection with such other business or the promotion thereof, which is likely to cause confusion, mistake, or deception, or which is likely to dilute our rights in and to the Proprietary Marks. You further agree not to use, in any manner whatsoever, any designation of origin, description, trademark, service mark, or representation that suggests or implies a past or present association or connection with us, the System, the equipment, and/or the Proprietary Marks. 18.7 Pay All Sums Due. You agree to promptly pay all sums owing to us and our affiliates (regardless whether those obligations arise under this Agreement or otherwise). In the event of termination for any of your defaults, those sums will include all damages, costs, and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, discovery costs, and all other related expenses), that we incur as a result of the default. 18.8 Pay Damages. You agree to pay us all damages, costs, and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, discovery costs, and all other related expenses) that we incur as a result of your default under this Agreement and/or subsequent to the termination or expiration of this Agreement in obtaining injunctive or other relief for the enforcement of any provisions of this Section 18, which will be in addition to amounts due to us under Section 18.11 below. 18.9 Return Confidential Information. You agree to immediately return to us the Manual, the Program Materials, and all other manuals, records, and instructions containing confidential information (including, without limitation, any copies thereof, even if such copies were made in violation of this Agreement), all of which are acknowledged to be our property.\n\nPage 48 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\n18.10 Right to Enter and Continue Operations. In order to preserve the goodwill of the System following termination, we (or our designee) will have the right to enter the Franchised Business (without liability to you, your Principals, or otherwise) for the purpose continuing the Franchised Business's operation and maintaining the goodwill of the business. 18.11 Lost Future Royalties. If we terminate this Agreement based on your default, or if you abandon or otherwise cease to operate the Franchised Business, in addition to all other amounts due to us under this Agreement, you agree to pay to us, as liquidated damages, an amount calculated as follows: (a) the average of your monthly Royalty Fees that are due under this Agreement for the twelve (12) months immediately before your abandonment or our delivery of the notice of default (or, if you have been operating for less than 12 months, the average of your monthly Royalty Fees for the number of months you have operated the Franchised Business); (b) multiplied by the lesser of 36 or the number of months remaining in the then-current term of this Agreement under Section 2. 18.12 Our Rights. You agree not to do anything that would potentially interfere with or impede the exercise of our rights under this Section 18. 18.13 Offsets. We have the right to offset amounts that you owe to us against any payment that we may be required to make under this Agreement. 19 COVENANTS 19.1 Full Time Efforts. You agree that during the term of this Agreement, except as we have otherwise approved in writing, you (or the Operating Principal or Manager) will devote full time, energy, and best efforts to the management and operation of the Franchised Business. 19.2 Understandings. 19.2.1 You acknowledge and agree that: (a) pursuant to this Agreement, you will have access to valuable trade secrets, specialized training and Confidential Information from us and our affiliates regarding the development, operation, management, purchasing, sales and marketing methods and techniques of the System; (b) the System and the opportunities, associations and experience we have established and that you will have access to under this Agreement are of substantial and material value; (c) in developing the System, we and our affiliates have made and continue to make substantial investments of time, technical and commercial research, and money; (d) we would be unable to adequately protect the System and its trade secrets and Confidential Information against unauthorized use or disclosure and would be unable to adequately encourage a free exchange of ideas and information among franchisees in our system if franchisees were permitted to hold interests in Competitive Businesses (as defined below); and (e) restrictions on your right to hold interests in, or perform services for, Competitive Businesses will not unreasonably or unnecessarily hinder your activities. 19.2.2 As used in this Section 19, the term \"Competitive Business\" is agreed to mean any property and/or casualty insurance distribution business. 19.3 Covenant Not to Compete or Engage in Injurious Conduct. Accordingly, you covenant and agree that, during the term of this Agreement and for a continuous period of two (2) years after the expiration or termination of this Agreement, and/or a transfer as contemplated in Section 16 above, you will not directly, indirectly, for yourself, or through, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any party, in any manner whatsoever, do any of the following:\n\nPage 49 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\n19.3.1 Divert or attempt to divert any actual or potential business or customer of any Goosehead Business to any competitor or otherwise take any action injurious or prejudicial to the goodwill associated with the Marks and the System. 19.3.2 Employ or seek to employ any person who is then employed by us or any other Goosehead Business franchisee or developer, or otherwise directly or indirectly induce such person to leave his or her employment. In addition to any other rights and remedies available to us under this Agreement, in the event of a violation of this Section, we will have the right to require you to pay to us (or such other Goosehead Business developer or franchisee, as the case may be) an amount equal to three times the annual salary of the person(s) involved in such violation, plus an amount equal to our costs and attorney's fees incurred in connection with such violation. 19.3.3 Own, maintain, develop, operate, engage in, franchise or license, make loans to, lease real or personal property to, be associated with, accept any compensation or remuneration from, and/or have any whatsoever interest in, or render services or give advice to, any Competitive Business. 19.4 Where Restrictions Apply. During the term of this Agreement, there is no geographical limitation on the restrictions set forth in Section 19.3 above. During the two-year period following the expiration, the non- renewal, or earlier termination of this Agreement, or a transfer as contemplated under Section 16 above, these restrictions will apply only within the city and county in which the Approved Location is situated. These restrictions will not apply to businesses that you operate that we (or our affiliates) have franchised to you pursuant to a valid franchise agreement. 19.5 Post-Term. You further covenant and agree that, for a continuous period of two (2) years after (1) the expiration of this Agreement, (2) the non-renewal of this Agreement, (3) the termination of this Agreement, and/or (4) a transfer as contemplated in Section 16 above: 19.5.1 you will not directly or indirectly, for yourself, or through, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other entity, sell, assign, lease, and/or transfer the Approved Location to any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other entity that you know, or have reason to know, intends to operate a Competitive Business at the Approved Location; and 19.5.2 you will not solicit, divert, or attempt to solicit or divert any actual or potential business or customer of the Franchised Business to any Competitive Business. 19.5.3 You agree that, by the terms of any conveyance, selling, assigning, leasing or transferring your interest in the Approved Location, you shall include these restrictive covenants as necessary to ensure that a Competitive Business that would violate this Section is not operated at the Approved Location for this two-year period, and you will take all steps necessary to ensure that these restrictive covenants become a matter of public record. 19.6 Periods of Non-Compliance. Any period of non-compliance with the requirements of this Section 19, whether such non-compliance takes place after termination, expiration, non-renewal, and/or a transfer, will not be credited toward satisfying the two-year obligation specified above. 19.7 Publicly-Held Entities. Section 19.3.3 above will not apply to your ownership of less than five percent (5%) beneficial interest in the outstanding equity securities of any publicly-held\n\nPage 50 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\ncorporation. As used in this Agreement, the term \"publicly-held corporation\" will be deemed to refer to a corporation which has securities that have been registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 19.8 Personal Covenants. You agree to require and obtain execution of covenants similar to those set forth in Sections 9.3, 11, 16, 18 above, and this Section 19 (as modified to apply to an individual), from your Managers, Producers and other managerial and/or executive staff, as well as your Principals. The covenants required by this section must be in the form provided in Exhibit F to this Agreement. If you do not obtain execution of the covenants required by this section and deliver to us those signed covenants, that failure will constitute a default under Section 17.2.6 above. 19.9 Construction. The parties agree that each of the foregoing covenants will be construed as independent of any other covenant or provision of this Agreement. We have the right to reduce in writing the scope of any part of this Section 19 and, if we do so, you agree to comply with the obligations as we have reduced them. 19.10 Claims Not a Defense. You agree that the existence of any claims you may have against us, whether or not arising from this Agreement, will not constitute a defense to our enforcement of the covenants in this Section 19. You agree to pay all costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, discovery costs, and all other related expenses) that we incur in connection with the enforcement of this Section 19. 19.11 Covenant as to Anti-Terrorism Laws. You and the owners of your business (\"Owners\") agree to comply with and/or to assist us to the fullest extent possible in our efforts to comply with Anti-Terrorism Laws (as defined below). In connection with such compliance, you and the Owners certify, represent, and warrant that none of their respective property or interests are \"blocked\" under any of the Anti-Terrorism Laws and that neither you nor any of the Owners are in violation of any of the Anti-Terrorism Laws. You also agree not to knowingly hire or do business with (or continue to employ or do business with) any party who is blocked under any of the Anti-Terrorism Laws. The term \"Anti-Terrorism Laws\" means Executive Order 13224 issued by the President of the United States, as supplemented, the USA PATRIOT Act, and all other laws and regulations addressing or in any way relating to terrorist acts and/or acts of war. 19.12 Defaults. You acknowledge and agree that your violation of the terms of this Section 19 would result in irreparable injury to us for which no adequate remedy at law may be available, and you accordingly consent to the issuance of an injunction prohibiting any conduct in violation of the terms of this Section 19. 20 TAXES, PERMITS, AND INDEBTEDNESS 20.1 Payment of Taxes. You agree to promptly pay when due all taxes levied or assessed, including, without limitation, unemployment and sales taxes, and all accounts and other indebtedness of every kind that you incur in the conduct of the business franchised under this Agreement. You agree to pay us an amount equal to any sales tax, gross receipts tax, or similar tax imposed on us with respect to any payments that you make to us as required under this Agreement, unless the tax is credited against income tax that we otherwise pay to a state or federal authority. 20.2 Payment of Trade Creditors. You agree to promptly pay when due all trade creditors and vendors (including any that are affiliated with us) that supply goods or services to you and/or the Franchised Business.\n\nPage 51 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\n20.3 Your Right to Contest Liabilities. If there is a bona fide dispute as to your liability for taxes assessed or other indebtedness, you may contest the validity or the amount of the tax or indebtedness in accordance with procedures of the taxing authority or applicable law; however, in no event will you permit a tax sale or seizure by levy of execution or similar writ or warrant, or attachment by a creditor, to occur against the premises of the Franchised Business, or any improvements thereon. 20.4 Compliance with Law. You agree to comply with all federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations, and to timely obtain any and all permits, certificates, or licenses necessary for the full and proper conduct of the business franchised under this Agreement, including, without limitation, licenses to do business, health certificates, fictitious name registrations, sales tax permits, and fire clearances. To the extent that the requirements of any such laws are in conflict with the terms of this Agreement, the Manual, or our other instructions, you agree to: (a) comply with said laws; (b) immediately provide us with written notice describing the nature of the conflict; and (c) cooperate with us and our counsel in developing a way to comply with the terms of this Agreement, as well as applicable law, to the extent that it is possible to do so. 20.5 Notice of Violations and Actions. You agree to notify us in writing within five (5) days after: (a) you receive notice of any health or safety violation, the commencement of any action, suit, or proceeding, and of the issuance of any order, writ, injunction, award, or decree of any court, agency, or other governmental instrumentality, (b) the occurrence of any accident or injury which may adversely affect the operation of the Franchised Business or your financial condition, or give rise to liability or a claim against either party to this Agreement, or (c) the discovery of any facts that may give rise to a professional liability claim against either party to this Agreement. 21 INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AND INDEMNIFICATION 21.1 Independent Contractor Relationship. The parties acknowledge and agree that: 21.1.1 this Agreement does not create a fiduciary relationship between them; 21.1.2 you are the only party that will be in day-to-day control of your franchised business, even though we will share the brand and Proprietary Marks as specified in this Agreement, and neither this Agreement nor any of the systems, guidance, computer programs, processes, or requirements under which you operate alter that basic fact; 21.1.3 nothing in this Agreement and nothing in our course of conduct is intended to make either party an agent, legal representative, subsidiary, joint venturer, partner, employee, or servant of the other for any purpose whatsoever; and 21.1.4 neither this Agreement nor our course of conduct is intended, nor may anything in this Agreement (nor our course of conduct) be construed, to state or imply that we are the employer of your employees and/or independent contractors, nor vice versa 21.2 Notice of Status. At all times during the term of this Agreement and any extensions hereof, you will hold yourself out to the public as an independent contractor operating the business pursuant to a franchise from us. You agree to take such action as may be necessary to do so, including, without limitation, exhibiting a notice of that fact in a conspicuous place at the Approved Location, the content of which we reserve the right to specify.\n\nPage 52 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\n21.3 No Contracts in our Name. It is understood and agreed that, except as may be necessary for you to provide Products or Services to customers using the Proprietary Marks, nothing in this Agreement authorizes you to make any contract, agreement, warranty, or representation on our behalf, or to incur any debt or other obligation in our name; and that we will in no event assume liability for, or be deemed liable under this Agreement as a result of, any such action; nor will we be liable by reason of any act or omission in your conduct of the Franchised Business or for any claim or judgment arising therefrom against either party to this Agreement. 21.4 Indemnification. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Franchisor Parties against any and all Damages arising directly or indirectly from any Asserted Claim as well as from your breach of this Agreement. Your indemnity obligations will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, and will not be affected by the presence of any applicable insurance policies and coverages that we may maintain. 21.5 Definitions. As used in Section 21.4 above, the parties agree that the following terms will have the following meanings: 21.5.1 \"Asserted Claim\" means any allegation, claim or complaint that is the result of, or in connection with, your exercise of your rights and/or carrying out of your obligations under this Agreement (including any claim associated with your operation of the Franchised Business or otherwise), or any default by you under this Agreement, notwithstanding any claim that any Franchisor Party was or may have been negligent. 21.5.2 \"Franchisor Parties\" means us, our shareholders, parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents. 21.5.3 \"Damages\" means all claims, demands, causes of action, suits, damages, liabilities, fines, penalties, assessments, judgments, losses, and expenses (including without limitation expenses, costs and lawyers' fees incurred for any indemnified party's primary defense or for enforcement of its indemnification rights). 22 FORCE MAJEURE 22.1 Impact. Neither party will be responsible to the other for non-performance or delay in performance occasioned by causes beyond its control, including without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (a) acts of nature; (b) acts of war, terrorism, or insurrection; (c) strikes, lockouts, labor actions, boycotts, floods, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, and/or other casualties; and/or (d) our inability (and that of our affiliates and/or suppliers) to manufacture, purchase, and/or cause delivery of any services or products used in the operation of the Franchised Business. 22.2 Transmittal of Funds. The inability of either party to obtain and/or remit funds will be considered within control of such party for the purpose of Section 22.1 above. If any such delay occurs, any applicable time period will be automatically extended for a period equal to the time lost; provided, however, that the party affected makes reasonable efforts to correct the reason for such delay and gives to the other party prompt notice of any such delay; and further provided, however, that you will remain obligated to promptly pay all fees owing and due to us under this Agreement, without any such delay or extension.\n\nPage 53 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\n23 APPROVALS AND WAIVERS 23.1 Request for Approval. Whenever this Agreement requires our prior approval or consent, you agree to make a timely written request to us therefor, and such approval or consent must be obtained in writing. 23.2 No Warranties or Guarantees. You acknowledge and agree that we make no warranties or guarantees upon which you may rely, and that we assume no liability or obligation to you, by providing any waiver, approval, consent, or suggestion to you in connection with this Agreement, or by reason of any neglect, delay, or denial of any request therefor. 23.3 No Waivers. No delay, waiver, omission, or forbearance on our part to exercise any right, option, duty, or power arising out of any breach or default by you or any other franchisee under any of the terms, provisions, covenants, or conditions of this Agreement, and no custom or practice by the parties at variance with the terms of this Agreement, will constitute our waiver of our right to enforce any such right, option, duty, or power as against you, or as to subsequent breach or default by you. If we accept late payments from you or any payments due, that will not be deemed to be our waiver of any earlier or later breach by you of any terms, provisions, covenants, or conditions of this Agreement. No course of dealings or course of conduct will be effective to amend the terms of this Agreement. 24 NOTICES\n\nAny and all notices required or permitted under this Agreement must be in writing and must be personally delivered, sent by certified U.S. mail, or by other means which affords the sender evidence of delivery, of rejected delivery, or attempted delivery to the respective parties at the addresses shown on the signature page of this Agreement, unless and until a different address has been designated by written notice to the other party. Any notice by a means that gives the sender evidence of delivery, rejected delivery, or delivery that is not possible because the recipient moved and left no forwarding address will be deemed to have been given at the date and time of receipt, rejected, and/or attempted delivery. The Manual, any changes that we make to the Manual, and/or any other written instructions that we provide relating to operational matters, are not considered to be \"notices\" for the purpose of the delivery requirements in this Section 24. 25 ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND AMENDMENT 25.1 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the exhibits referred to in this Agreement constitute the entire, full, and complete Agreement between the parties to this Agreement concerning the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior agreements. The parties confirm that: (a) they were not induced by any representations other than the words of this Agreement (and the FDD) before deciding whether to sign this Agreement; and (b) they relied only on the words printed in this Agreement in deciding whether to enter into this Agreement. However, nothing in this Section is intended as, nor will it be interpreted to be, a disclaimer by us of any representation made in our Franchise Disclosure Document (\"FDD\"), including the exhibits and any amendments to the FDD. 25.2 Amendment. Except for those changes that we are permitted to make unilaterally under this Agreement, no amendment, change, or variance from this Agreement will be binding on either party unless mutually agreed to by the parties and executed by their authorized officers or agents in writing.\n\nPage 54 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\n26 SEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION 26.1 Introductory Paragraphs. The parties agree that the introductory paragraphs of this Agreement, under the heading \"Introduction,\" are accurate, and the parties agree to incorporate those paragraphs into the text of this Agreement as if they were printed here. 26.2 Severability. Except as expressly provided to the contrary herein, each portion, section, part, term, and/or provision of this Agreement will be considered severable; and if, for any reason, any section, part, term, and/or provision herein is determined to be invalid and contrary to, or in conflict with, any existing or future law or regulation by a court or agency having valid jurisdiction, such will not impair the operation of, or have any other effect upon, such other portions, sections, parts, terms, and/or provisions of this Agreement as may remain otherwise intelligible; and the latter will continue to be given full force and effect and bind the parties hereto; and said invalid portions, sections, parts, terms, and/or provisions will be deemed not to be a part of this Agreement. 26.3 No Third Party Rights. Except as expressly provided to the contrary herein, nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor will be deemed, to confer upon any person or legal entity other than you, we, and such of our respective successors and assigns as may be contemplated (and, as to you, permitted) by Section 16.4 above, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement. 26.4 Captions Don't Amend Terms. All captions in this Agreement are intended solely for the convenience of the parties, and no caption will be deemed to affect the meaning or construction of any provision hereof. 26.5 Including.

Each party will bear all of the costs of exercising its rights and carrying out its responsibilities under this Agreement, except as otherwise provided. 26.9 Counterparts.

This Agreement takes effect when we accept and sign this document. This Agreement will be interpreted and construed exclusively under the laws of the State of Texas, which laws will prevail in the event of any conflict of law (without regard to, and without giving effect to, the application of Texas choice-of-law rules); provided, however, that if the covenants in Section 19 of this Agreement would not be enforced as written under\n\nPage 55 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas law, then the parties agree that those covenants will instead be interpreted and construed under the laws of the state in which the Franchised Business is located. Nothing in this Section 27.1 is intended by the parties to invoke the application of any franchise, business opportunity, antitrust, implied covenant, unfair competition, fiduciary, and/or other doctrine of law of the State of Texas (or any other state) that would not otherwise apply without this Section 27.1. 27.2 Choice of Venue. Subject to Section 27.3 below, the parties agree that any action that you bring against us, in any court, whether federal or state, must be brought only within the state and judicial district in which we maintain our principal place of business. Any action that we bring against you in any court, whether federal or state, may be brought within the state and judicial district in which we maintain our principal place of business. 27.2.1 The parties agree that this Section 27.2 will not be construed as preventing either party from removing an action from state to federal court; provided, however, that venue will be as set forth above. 27.2.2 The parties hereby waive all questions of personal jurisdiction or venue for the purpose of carrying out this provision. 27.2.3 Any such action will be conducted on an individual basis, and not as part of a consolidated, common, or class action. 27.3 Mediation. Before any party may bring an action in court against the other, the parties agree that they must first meet to mediate the dispute (except as otherwise provided in Section 27.5 below).

No delay or failure by the Franchisor or Franchisee to exercise any right under this Agreement, and no partial or single exercise of that right, will constitute a waiver of that or any other right provided herein, and no waiver of any violation of any terms and provisions of this Agreement will be construed as a waiver of any succeeding violation of the same or any other provision of this Agreement.\n\n5. Third-Party Beneficiary. Member hereby acknowledges and agrees that Franchisor is an intended third-party beneficiary of this Agreement with the right to enforce it, independently or jointly with Franchisee.\n\nPage 72 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Franchisee and the Member attest that each has read and understands the terms of this Agreement, and voluntarily signed this Agreement on the date first written above. FRANCHISEE By: Name: Title:\n\nMEMBER By: Name: Title:\n\nPage 73 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nGOOSEHEAD INSURANCE AGENCY, LLC FRANCHISE AGREEMENT EXHIBIT G\n\nSITE SELECTION ADDENDUM\n\nGoosehead Insurance Agency, LLC (\"Franchisor\" or \"us\" or \"we\") and (\"Franchisee\" or \"you\") have this day of , 201 entered into a Goosehead Insurance Franchise Agreement (\"Franchise Agreement\") and wish to supplement its terms as set out below in this Site Selection Addendum (the \"Addendum\"). The parties agree as follows:\n\nAGREEMENT\n\n1. Time to Locate Site: Within ninety (90) days after the date of this Addendum, you agree to acquire or lease/sublease, at your own expense, commercial real estate that is properly zoned for the use of the business that you will conduct under the Franchise Agreement (the \"Franchised Business\") at a site that we will have approved in writing as provided below.\n\na. Such location must be within the following area: (the \"Site Selection Area\").\n\nb. The only reason that the Site Selection Area is described is for the purpose of selecting a site for the Franchised Business.\n\nc. For purposes of this Addendum, the term \"Search Period\" means ninety (90) days from the date of this Addendum, or the period from the date of this Addendum until we have approved of a location for your Franchised Business, whichever event first occurs.\n\nd. If you do not acquire or lease a site (that we have approved in writing) for the Franchised Business in accordance with this Addendum by not later than ninety (90) days after the date of this Addendum, that will constitute a default under Section 17.2 of the Franchise Agreement and also under this Addendum, and we will have the right to terminate the Franchise Agreement and this Addendum pursuant to the terms of Section 17.2 of the Franchise Agreement.\n\n2. Site Evaluation Services: We will provide you with our site selection guidelines, including our minimum standards for a location for the Franchised Business, and such site selection counseling and assistance as we may deem advisable. If we deem on-site evaluation to be necessary and appropriate, we will conduct up to two (2) on-site evaluations at our cost and expense. If we perform any additional on-site evaluations, you must reimburse us, as applicable, for all reasonable expenses that we incur in connection with such on-site evaluation, including, without limitation, the cost of travel, lodging and meals. We will not provide on site evaluation for any proposed site before we have received from you a completed site approval form for the site (prepared as set forth in Section 3 below).\n\n3. Site Selection Package Submission and Approval: You must submit to us, in the form that we specify: (a) a completed site approval form (in the form that we require); (b) such other information or materials that we may reasonably require; and (c) an option contract, letter of intent, or other evidence satisfactory to us that confirms your favorable prospects for obtaining the site. You acknowledge that time is of the essence. We will have thirty (30) days after receipt of all such information and materials from you to approve or disapprove the proposed site as the location for the Franchised Business. We have the right to approve or disapprove any such site to serve as the\n\nPage 74 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nApproved Location for the Franchised Business. If we do not approve a proposed site by giving you written notice within the 30-day period, then we will be deemed to have disapproved the site.\n\n4. Lease Responsibilities: After we have approved a site and before the expiration of the Search Period, you must execute a lease, which must be coterminous with the Franchise Agreement, or a binding agreement to purchase the site. Our approval of any lease is conditioned upon inclusion in the lease of the Lease Rider attached to the Franchise Agreement as Exhibit H. However, even if we examine the Lease, we are not responsible for review of the Lease for any terms other than those contained in the Lease Rider.\n\n5. Approved Location: After we have approved the location for the Franchised Business and you have leased or acquired that location, the location will constitute the Approved Location described in Section 1.2 of the Franchise Agreement. The Approved Location will be specified on Exhibit A to the Franchise Agreement, and will become a part the Franchise Agreement.\n\na. You Franchisee hereby acknowledge and agree that our approval of a site does not constitute an assurance, representation, or warranty of any kind, express or implied, as to the suitability of the site for the Franchised Business or for any other purpose. Our approval of the site indicates only that we believe the site complies with our minimum acceptable criteria solely for our own purposes as of the time of the evaluation. The parties each acknowledge that application of criteria that have been effective with respect to other sites and premises may not be predictive of potential for all sites and that, subsequent to our approval of a site, demographic and/or economic factors, such as competition from other similar businesses, included in or excluded from criteria that we used could change, thereby altering the potential of a site. Such factors are unpredictable and are beyond our control.\n\nb. We will not be responsible for the failure of a site (even if we have approved that site) to meet your expectations as to revenue or operational criteria.\n\nc. You acknowledge and agree that your acceptance of a franchise for the operation of the Franchised Business at the site is based on its own independent investigation of the suitability of the site.\n\n6. Construction: This Addendum will be considered an integral part of the Franchise Agreement between the parties hereto, and the terms of this Addendum will be controlling with respect to the subject matter hereof. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein will have the same meaning as set forth in the Franchise Agreement. Except as modified or supplemented by this Addendum, the terms of the Franchise Agreement are hereby ratified and confirmed.\n\nPage 75 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, each party hereto has caused its duly authorized representative to duly execute and deliver this Addendum on the date first above written.

Landlord agrees to deliver to Franchisor a copy of any notice of default or termination of the Lease at the same time such notice is delivered to Franchisee. Franchisor agrees to deliver to Landlord a copy of any notice of termination under the Franchise Agreement. Franchisee hereby consents to that exchange of information by Landlord and Franchisor. 2. Franchisee hereby assigns to Franchisor, with Landlord's irrevocable and unconditional consent, all of Franchisee's rights, title and interests to and under the Lease upon any termination or non-renewal of the Franchise Agreement, but no such assignment will be effective unless and until: (a) the Franchise Agreement is terminated or expires without renewal; (b) Franchisor has exercised its Option to Purchase under the Franchise Agreement; and (c) Franchisor notifies the Franchisee and Landlord in writing that Franchisor assumes Franchisee's obligations under the Lease. 3. Franchisor will have the right, but not the obligation, to cure any breach of the Lease (within fifteen (15) business days after the expiration of the period in which Franchisee had to cure any such default should Franchisee fail to do so) upon giving written notice of its election to Franchisee and Landlord, and, if so stated in the notice, to also succeed to Franchisee's rights, title and interests thereunder. The Lease may not be modified, amended, supplemented, renewed, extended or assigned by Franchisee without Franchisor's prior written consent. 4.

Landlord agrees to execute such further documentation to\n\nPage 77 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\nconfirm its consent to the assignment permitted under this Addendum as Franchisor may reasonably request.

Landlord agrees to permit Franchisor, its employees or agent, to enter the Premises and remove signs (both interior and exterior), d\u00e9cor and materials displaying any marks, designs or logos owned by Franchisor, provided that Franchisor will bear the expense of repairing any damage to the Premises as a result thereof. 7. If Landlord is an affiliate or an Owner of Franchisee, Landlord and Franchisee agree that if Landlord proposes to sell the Premises, before the sale of the Premises, upon the request of Franchisor the Lease will be amended to reflect a rental rate and other terms that are the reasonable and customary rental rates and terms prevailing in the community where the \"Goosehead Insurance\" business is located. 8. Landlord agrees that during and after the term of the Lease, it will not disclose or use Franchisor's Confidential Information (as defined below) for any purpose other than for the purpose of fulfilling Landlord's obligations under the Lease. \"Confidential Information\" as used herein will mean all non-public information and tangible things, whether written, oral, electronic or in other form, provided or disclosed by or on behalf of Franchisee to Landlord, or otherwise obtained by Landlord, regarding the design and operations of the business located at the Premises, including, without limitation, all information identifying or describing the floor plan and layout, furnishings, equipment, fixtures, wall coverings, flooring materials, shelving, decorations, trade secrets, techniques, trade dress, \"look and feel,\" design, manner of operation, suppliers, vendors, and all other products, goods, and services used, useful or provided by or for Franchisee on the Premises. Landlord acknowledges that all such Confidential Information belongs exclusively to Franchisor. 9. Landlord agrees that: (a) Franchisor has granted to only one party, the Franchisee, the right to use Franchisor's proprietary trade name, trademarks, service marks logos, insignias, slogans, emblems, symbols, designs and indicia of origin (collectively the \"Marks\") at the Premises under the terms of the Franchise Agreement; and (b) Franchisor has not granted any rights or privileges to use the Marks to Landlord. 10. Landlord and Franchisee agree that the premises will be used solely for the operation of a \"Goosehead Insurance\" business. 11. Landlord and Franchisee agree that any default under the lease will also constitute a default under the Franchise Agreement, and any default under the Franchise Agreement will also constitute a default under the lease. 12. Landlord and Franchisee agree that the terms contained herein will supersede any terms to the contrary set forth in the Lease.\n\nPage 78 of 80\n\n\n\n\n\n13. Franchisor, along with its successors and assigns, is an intended third party beneficiary of the provisions of this Addendum. 14. Landlord and Franchisee agree that copies of any and all notices required or permitted under this Addendum, or under the Lease, will also be sent to Franchisor at (attention ), or to such other address as Franchisor may specify by giving written notice to Landlord.\n\nWITNESS the execution hereof under seal.

California Corporations Code, Section 31125, requires Franchisor to give Franchisee a disclosure document, approved by the Department of Business Oversight, before a solicitation of a proposed material modification of an existing franchise. 2. THE CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE INVESTMENT LAW REQUIRES THAT A COPY OF ALL PROPOSED AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE SALE OF THE FRANCHISE BE DELIVERED TOGETHER WITH THE DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT. 3. Item 3 of the Franchise Disclosure Document is modified by adding the following paragraph to the end thereof:\n\nNeither Goosehead Insurance Agency, LLC nor any person listed in Item 2 of this Franchise Disclosure Document is subject to any currently effective order of any national securities association or national securities exchange, as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.A. 78a et seq., suspending or expelling these persons from membership in this association or exchange. 4. Item 17 of the Franchise Disclosure Document is modified by adding the following paragraphs to the end of Item 17:\n\nCalifornia Business and Professions Code Sections 20000 through 20043 provide rights to Franchisee concerning termination, transfer or non-renewal of a franchise. If the Franchise Agreement contains a provision that is inconsistent with the law, the law will control.\n\nThe Franchise Agreement provides for termination upon bankruptcy. This provision may not be enforceable under federal bankruptcy law (11 U.S.C.A. Sec. 101 et seq.).\n\nThe Franchise Agreement contains a covenant not to compete which extends beyond the termination of the franchise. This provision may not be enforceable under California law.\n\nProspective franchisees are encouraged to consult private legal counsel to determine the applicability of California and federal laws (such as Business and Professions Code Section 20040.5, Code of Civil Procedure\n\nFDD Exhibit H-1\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 1281, and the Federal Arbitration Act) to any provisions of a franchise agreement restricting venue to a forum outside the State of California.\n\nThe Franchise Agreement requires application of the laws of the State of Texas. This provision may not be enforceable under California law.\n\nThe Franchise Agreement requires Franchisee to sign a general release of claims upon renewal or transfer of the Franchise Agreement. California Corporations Code Section 31512 provides that any condition, stipulation or provision purporting to bind any person acquiring any franchise to waive compliance with any provision of that law or any rule or order thereunder is void. Section 31512 voids a waiver of Franchisee's rights under the Franchise Investment Law (California Corporations Code Section 31000-31516). Business and Professions Code Section 20010 voids a waiver of Franchisee's rights under the Franchise Relations Act (Business and Professions Code Sections 20000-20043). 5.

Section 17.3 of the Franchise Agreement is amended to read as follows:\n\n17.3 Termination with Notice and Opportunity to Cure. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 17.1 and 17.2 of this Agreement, you will have 60 days after your receipt from us of a written notice of default within which to remedy any default under this Agreement and to provide evidence thereof to us.

DEFINITIONS\n\nThe terms defined in this Section shall have the meaning as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nFIRST LEVEL OF MAINTENANCE means MORPHO will require the Kuwait Government to contact MORPHO maintenance personnel for all problems associated with the installed Force Field PSS System. MORPHO will respond with fixes and/or workarounds to keep the system operational. MORPHO personnel may document any software problems and refer them to XIMAGE for additional fixes or patches.\n\nSECOND LEVEL OF MAINTENANCE means if Morpho's personnel can not start or keep the system operational because of software problems, XIMAGE should be contacted to provide all documented and replicated software Errors. XIMAGE will make best efforts to support Morpho by any means available. Such an undertaking is made in the knowledge that a telecommunications line between the site and XIMAGE may not be in existance.\n\nPROGRAM means ForceField PSS software developed by XIMAGE including the Sybase and Focus software and includes all software provided under the Maintenance Agreement.\n\nPROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS means the specifications published by XIMAGE for a particular version of the Program (if no such specification is available, then the relevant documentation for a particular version of the Program).\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE shall mean the Date of Installation of the PSS in Kuwait, i.e. December 10, 1993.\n\nERROR means any material failure to operate in accordance with the program specifications delivered from the specifications appended to the base agreement.

TERM OF AGREEMENT\n\nXIMAGE's obligations hereunder shall become effective upon the      \"Effective Date\" and, unless sooner terminated as provided herein, shall      remain in full force and effect for at least one year thereafter. This      Agreement shall automatically renew for consecutive one (1) year terms      at XIMAGE's then prevailing rates at the end of each one (1) year term      unless either party gives at least sixty (60) days prior written notice      of the non-renewal of this Agreement.\n\n3.   SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE SERVICES\n\nXIMAGE will provide to MORPHO during the term hereof \"Software      Maintenance Services\" which shall include remedial maintenance service      (i.e, error fixing and/or work arounds) for any significant error,      malfunction or defect (collectively in \"Error\") in the Software so that      the Software will operate in accordance with the specifications set      forth in the related documentation. Correction of Errors is subject to      MORPHO's prompt notification to XIMAGE of the nature and description of      the Error provided that the Error is not caused by the abuse, misuse or      neglect of the products by MORPHO. In addition, XIMAGE will provide the      following as additional Customer Support Services:\n\n(a)  telephone support as reasonably requested by MORPHO at the rate of           $100 per hour for all hours in excess of 40 hours in any one-year           term;\n\n(b)  on-site visits to MORPHO's sites as determined to be necessary by           Morpho for Error correction, unless error correction is normally           performed via Dial up from the XImage facility in San Jose;\n\n(c)  give title to all modifications and improvements to the PSS           Software which XIMAGE generally makes available to its other           customers (at no additional Charge) under standard software           maintenance agreements relating to the Software.\n\nIf MORPHO requests XIMAGE to perform any other services, the related terms and conditions shall be based on further separate agreement between the parties. This Agreement and the rights and duties contained herein are not be deemed to cover maintenance services with respect to hardware. Such may be decided in accordance with paragraph 9.\n\n4.   PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES\n\nWhen XIMAGE provides Software Maintenance Services which require the use      of the hardware portion of equipment which utilizes the Software (the      \"Equipment\"), MORPHO shall make such Equipment available to XIMAGE at and      for reasonable times, and in no event will MORPHO charge XIMAGE for such      use of such Equipment. All Software Maintenance Services covered by the      Maintenance Charges will be performed during the regular business hours      of XIMAGE (Monday-Friday, exclusive holidays). If Software Maintenance      Services are performed outside regular business hours, MORPHO will pay      the additional charges, if any, as at XIMAGES then current charges.\n\n                                         Page 4\n\n\n\n\n\n5.

The Recipient agrees to assist the disclosing party in      remedying any such unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential      Information. This obligation will not apply to the extent that the      Recipient can demonstrate:\n\n(a)  the disclosed information at the time of disclosure is part of the           public domain;\n\n                                         Page 5\n\n(b)  the disclosed information became part of the public domain, by           publication or otherwise, except by breach of the provisions of this           Agreement;\n\n(c)  the disclosed information can be established by written evidence to           have been in the possession of the Recipient at the time of           disclosure;\n\n(d)  the disclosed information is received from a third party without           similar restrictions and without breach of this Agreement; or\n\n(e)  the disclosed information is required to be disclosed by a           government agency to further the objectives of this agreement, such           as to obtain permission to distribute the Program of by a proper           court of competent jurisdiction; provided, however, that the           Recipient wil use its best efforts to minimize the disclosure of           such information and will consult with and assist the Disclosing           Party in obtaining a protective order prior to such disclosure.\n\n8.   RESPONSE BY XIMAGE.\n\nXIMAGE will maintain a 24 hour a day reporting facility to accept calls      from MORPHO. XIMAGE agrees to respond to any telephone call made, within      30 minutes.\n\n9.

XIMAGE undertake to have an engineer on site in Kuwait within      72 hours from the time the request was made, exclusive of the time      required to arrange for travel and obtain the required documents, and      the actual travel time itself.      In such cases where on site intervention is required MORPHO shall pay      for all travel expenses (Business Class), hotel accomodation and      reasonable subsistence. XIMAGE shall charge for the time of the engineer      only when he/she is on site or in exceptional circumstances when away      from the site but directly involved in work connected with the PSS.      XIMAGE will not charge for travel time.\n\nAll interventions on site are subject to a minimum total charge of      $2,000.

RETURN AND REPAIR\n\nMORPHO may, at its option, return equipment to XIMAGE for repair. XIMAGE      will make its best efforts to liaise with the supplier of the equipment      and to expeditiously repair and return the equipment. XIMAGE reserves the      right to charge an administration fee of $100 per shipment in such cases.\n\n11.  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF/TERMINATION\n\nMORPHO acknowledges and agrees that any violation of the provisions of      Section 7 herein by MORPHO will result in irreparable harm to XIMAGE and      that money damages would provide inadequate remedy.

The other Party will then have a period of fourteen (14) days from the date of the notice to indicate whether it also desires to extend the Term, on the terms and conditions set forth herein and if no such indication is made, the other Party will be deemed to have declined the offer to extend. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Wade agrees that for a period of ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the Term (unless the Agreement is terminated by Wade as permitted hereunder), Naked shall have the exclusive right to negotiate for continued endorsement by Athlete of the Naked Products.

The Partnership, all of the Partners except Alpha Mariah (Prime), Inc. and Beta Mariah (Prime) Inc., and Manager entered into that certain Sagebrush Management and Maintenance Agreement, dated as of September 1, 1989 (the \"Agreement\").\n\n     B.  Concurrently herewith, all of the Partners are entering into a First Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Sagebrush General Co-Ownership Partnership Agreement, by which the Partners agree, among other things, that Alpha Mariah (Prime), Inc. and Beta Mariah (Prime), Inc. are admitted to the Partnership.\n\n     C.  The Partnership, the Partners and Manager desire to amend the Agreement to extend the term of the Agreement and to add a new section concerning curtailment of the LIFO Partners (as defined below), all as set forth in this Amendment.\n\n     NOW, THEREFORE, IN CONSIDERATION of the foregoing premises, the parties hereby agree as follows:\n\n     1.   Amendment.           ---------\n\n          (a)  Section 6.1 of the Agreement shall be, and hereby is, amended by deleting the date \"September 30, 2003\" where it appears therein, and inserting in its place the date \"July 20, 2006\".\n\n          (b)  A new Section 7.4 is hereby added to the Agreement, as follows:\n\n               \"7.4 Disconnection of LIFO Partners. In addition to the other rights provided to Manager hereunder to disconnect the Projects of the Partners (or their Partner Affiliates), Manager shall disconnect the Projects of Alpha Willow, SP11, SP12, SP13, SP14 and SP21 (together with their Partner Affiliates, the \"LIFO Partners\") in the following circumstances.\n\nIf at any time, and for any reason other than force majeure affecting the Transmission Line, (i) the Transmission Line is incapable of delivering power at its designed capacity, availability or voltage and curtailment of the Projects of the LIFO Partners would improve the capability of the transmission Line to deliver power at its designed capacity, availability and voltage, or (ii) the Transmission Line line losses exceed 1.14%, the excess line losses have an adverse effect on the Projects of Alpha Mariah, Alpha Mariah (Prime), Beta Mariah, Beta Mariah (Prime), or Gamma Mariah or their Partner Affiliates, and curtailment of the Projects of the LIFO Partners would reduce or eliminate such excess line losses, or (iii) the Transmission Line line losses for either of the power purchase contracts commonly known as Desert Winds I and Desert Winds III exceed the levels experienced immediately prior to the addition of the Projects of the LIFO Partners to the Transmission Line, the excess line losses have an adverse effect on the Projects of Alpha Joshua, Alpha Joshua (Prime), Beta Joshua, Beta Willow or Beta Willow (Prime) or their Partner Affiliates, and curtailment of the Projects of the LIFO Partners would reduce or eliminate such excess line losses, then the Manager shall curtail the Projects of the LIFO Partners. Nothing contained in the preceding sentence shall affect the rights of the Manager to curtail or disconnect the Project of a Partner under Section 4 of that Partner's Technical Use Agreement. Any curtailment under this provision shall be in an amount sufficient to cause the Transmission Line to deliver power at its designed capacity, availability and voltage, or to reduce the Transmission Line line losses, as applicable, up to and including the Projects of all of the LIFO Partners. Such curtailment shall continue until the Manager shall determine that reconnecting the Projects of the LIFO Partners shall not result in the recurrence of the event giving rise to the curtailment. If the LIFO Partners shall inform the Manager in writing of an agreement among them concerning the priority of the curtailment of their respective Projects, the Manager shall effect any curtailment under these provisions according to such priority. If the LIFO Partners fail to so inform the Manager, the Manager shall in its discretion determine which of the Projects of the LIFO Partners to curtail. The Manager shall cooperate with the LIFO Partners to attempt to eliminate the cause of any curtailment under this provision, provided that any expenses in connection with such cooperation shall be paid by the LIFO Partners. In connection with any attempt to eliminate the cause of any curtailment, no change to the Transmission Line shall be made without the prior unanimous consent of the Partners (excluding the LIFO Partners), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.\"\n\n          (c)  Existing Section 7.4 shall be renumbered as Section 7.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                       2\n\n          (d) All references in the Agreement to Manager as \"ToyoWest Management Company\" shall be interpreted as referring to \"ToyoWest Management Inc.,\" the correct name of Manager.\n\n     2.  Continuing Validity. Except as expressly modified by Section 1 of this          ------------------- Amendment, all of the terms and conditions of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. By execution of this Amendment, Alpha Mariah (Prime), Inc. and Beta Mariah (Prime), Inc. hereby become parties to the Agreement and agree to be bound by all of the terms of the Agreement and this Amendment.\n\n     3.   Miscellaneous. The provisions contained in Article 10 of the Agreement           ------------- are hereby incorporated herein by this cross-reference.\n\n                                       3\n\n          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Partnership, the Partners, and Manager have caused this Amendment to be executed on the dates set forth below the signatures of their respective representatives.\n\n                                           TOYOWEST MANAGEMENT INC.,                                            a California corporation\n\n                                           By:                                               ---------------------------------                                               Name:  Robert L.

FRANCHISE AGREEMENT   This Franchise Agreement (this or the \"Agreement\") is being entered into effective as of the _____ day of _______________, 20__ (the \"Agreement Date\"). The parties to this Agreement are The Joint Corp., a Delaware corporation (\"we,\" \"us,\" the \"Company,\" or \"The Joint Corp.\"); _________________________________________, as Franchise Owner (\"you,\" \"Franchise Owner,\" or \"Franchisee\"), and, if you are a partnership, corporation, or limited liability company, your \"Principal Owners\" (defined below).   1. INTRODUCTION.   This Agreement has been written in an informal style in order to make it more easily readable and to be sure that you become thoroughly familiar with all of the important rights and obligations the Agreement covers before you sign it. This Agreement includes several exhibits, all of which are legally binding and are an integral part of the complete Franchise Agreement. In this Agreement, we refer to The Joint Corp. as \"we,\" \"us,\" or the \"Company.\" We refer to you as \"you,\" \"Franchise Owner\" or \"Franchisee.\" If you are a corporation, partnership or limited liability company, you will notice certain provisions that are applicable to those principal shareholders, partners or members on whose business skill, financial capability and personal character we are relying in entering into this Agreement. Those individuals will be referred to in this Agreement as \"Principal Owners.\"   Through the expenditure of considerable time, effort and money, we and our affiliates have devised a system for the establishment and operation of The Joint Corp. business model, a chiropractic location that specializes in affordable, convenient, and accessible chiropractic care. It is our mission \"to improve your quality of life through affordable Chiropractic care.\" Our atmosphere is fun and upbeat, and no appointments are necessary (all of these characteristics are referred to in this Agreement as the \"System\"). This business model includes a location model offering all of our franchised services and products (individually, a \"Location\" and collectively, the \"Locations\"). We identify the System by the use of certain trademarks, service marks and other commercial symbols, including the marks \"The Joint\u2026A Chiropractic Place\u00ae\", \"The Joint\u2026The Chiropractic Place\u2122\" and certain associated designs, artwork and logos, which we may change or add to from time to time (the \"Marks\").   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  From time to time we grant to persons who meet our qualifications, franchises to own and operate a The Joint Corp. Location franchise business that will manage clinics that specialize in providing chiropractic services and products to the general public through licensed chiropractic professionals (\"Clinic(s)\"). This Agreement is being presented to you because of the desire you have expressed to obtain the right to develop, own, and be franchised to operate a The Joint Corp. Location (we will refer to your The Joint Corp. franchise as the \"Franchise\" or the \"Franchised Business\"). You may purchase and operate your Franchise as a new, start-up Location (a \"Start-up Location\"), or may convert an existing chiropractic practice to a The Joint Corp. Location (a \"Conversion Location\"). In signing this Agreement, you acknowledge that you have conducted an independent investigation of The Joint Corp. Franchised Business, and recognize that, like any other business, the nature of it may evolve and change over time, that an investment in a The Joint Corp. Franchised Business involves business risks, and that the success of this business venture is primarily dependent on your business abilities and efforts.   We expressly disclaim making, and you acknowledge that you have not received or relied on, any guarantee, express or implied, as to the revenues, profits, or likelihood of success of The Joint Corp. Franchise venture contemplated by this Agreement. You acknowledge that there have been no representations by us or our affiliates or our or their respective officers, directors, members, employees, or agents that are inconsistent with the statements made in our current Franchise Disclosure Document concerning the Franchised Business, or the provisions of this Agreement. You further represent to us, as an inducement to our entering into this Agreement with you, that there have been no misrepresentations to us in your application for the rights granted by this Agreement, or in the financial information provided by you and your Principal Owners.   2. GRANT OF FRANCHISE.   2.1 Term; Reference to Exhibit 1.   You have applied for a franchise to own and operate a The Joint Corp. Location, and we have approved your application in reliance on all of the representations you made in that application. As a result, and subject to the provisions of this Agreement, we grant to you a Franchise to operate a The Joint Corp. Location offering all products, services, and proprietary programs of ours, in accordance with all elements of the System, that we may require for The Joint Corp. Locations.   You must operate the Franchise at a mutually agreeable site (the \"Premises\") to be identified after the signing of this Agreement, and to use the System and the Marks in the operation of that Franchise, for a term of 10 years (the \"Initial Term\"). The Initial Term will begin on the Agreement Date. (For convenience, the expiration date of the Initial Term is listed on Exhibit 1.) Termination or expiration of this Agreement will constitute a termination or expiration of your Franchise. (All references to the \"term\" of this Agreement refer to the period from the Agreement Date to the date on which this Agreement actually terminates or expires.)   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  2.2 Full Term Performance.   You specifically agree to be obligated to operate the Franchise, perform the obligations of this Agreement, and continuously exert your best efforts to promote and enhance the business of the Franchise for the full term of this Agreement.   2.3 Management Agreement with Professional Corporation - Non-Licensed Franchisees.   If you are not a licensed chiropractor, prior to commencing operations of the Franchised Business, you must enter into a management agreement (\"Management Agreement\") with a chiropractic professional corporation (or a professional limited liability company, if permitted in the state in which the Clinic is located) (a \"PC\") whereby you will provide to the PC management and administrative services and support consistent with the System and as outlined in our form of Management Agreement, a copy of which is included as an Exhibit to our Disclosure Document, to support the PC's chiropractic practice and its delivery of chiropractic services and related products to chiropractic patients, consistent with all applicable laws and regulations.   The PC shall employ and control the chiropractors and other chiropractic personnel that will provide the actual chiropractic services required to be delivered at and through the Clinic.  You shall not provide any actual chiropractic services, nor shall you supervise, direct, control or suggest to, the PC or its chiropractors or employees the manner in which the PC provides or may provide chiropractic services to its patients. You acknowledge and agree that we will not provide any chiropractic services, nor will we supervise, direct, control or suggest to, the PC or its chiropractors or employees the manner in which the PC provide chiropractic services to its patients.   Due to various federal and state laws regarding the practice of chiropractic medicine, and the ownership and operation of chiropractic practices and health care businesses that provide chiropractic services, you understand and acknowledge that that you, as non-chiropractor Location franchisee, shall not engage in any practices that are, or may appear to be, the practice of chiropractic medicine. You acknowledge that the PC must offer all chiropractic services in accordance with the Management Agreement and the System.   You must use our standard form of Management Agreement, however, you may negotiate the monetary terms and, with our written consent, certain other terms of the relationship with the PC. We will not unreasonably withhold our approval to requested changes in the Management Agreement. You must obtain our written approval of the final Management Agreement prior to your execution. We must approve the PC candidate. You shall ensure that the PC offers all chiropractic services in accordance with the Management Agreement and the System. If you are not able to find a suitable chiropractor to create, own and staff the PC, we will attempt to help you find a suitable PC. You must have a Management Agreement in effect with a PC at all times during the operation of the Franchised Business and during the Initial Term of this Agreement.   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  If you are a licensed chiropractor, or part of a PC owned by licensed chiropractors, you do not need to execute a Management Agreement. However, you are still responsible for compliance with all laws application to the operation of a chiropractic Clinic and your Location franchise.   2.4 Waiver of Management Agreement.   In certain states, it may be permissible under the existing laws that may be applicable to chiropractic professionals and/or practices, such as chiropractic clinics, for a non-chiropractor to both own and operate a Clinic and a Location Franchise, including hiring chiropractic and other professional personnel and providing chiropractic services to patients at the Clinic. If you determine that the laws that would apply to a Clinic in your state would permit you to do so, you may request that we waive certain of the requirements of the Franchise Agreement related to separating the operation of the chiropractic aspects of the Clinic from the management aspects. In particular, you (i) would not enter into a Management Agreement with a PC that, as a separate entity, would otherwise operate the Clinic and provide all chiropractic services, and (ii) you would not be restricted from hiring and supervising chiropractic professionals. Any waiver, or any modification of our standards, would be subject to compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. If we agree to do a waiver, you must enter into an Amendment to Waive Management Agreement (\"Waiver Agreement\"), a copy of which is attached as an exhibit to our Disclosure Document. Under the Waiver Agreement, you will agree that, instead of entering into the Management Agreement with a separate PC, you will (a) operate the Clinic, including performing all responsibilities and obligations of the \"PC\" under the Management Agreement, and (b) manage the Clinic as required in this Agreement and by performing all the responsibilities and obligations of the \"Company\" under the Management Agreement.   You are responsible for operating in full compliance with all laws that apply to a Clinic, and you must make your own determination as to your legal compliance obligations. Additionally, the laws applicable to your Clinic may change, and if there are any chiropractic regulations or other laws that would render your operation of the Clinic through a single entity (or otherwise) in violation of any medical regulations, you must immediately advise us of such change and of the your proposed corrective action to comply with chiropractic regulations, including (if applicable) entering into a Management Agreement with a PC. Similarly, if we discover any such laws, upon providing you notice of such laws, you agree to make such changes as are necessary to comply with medical regulations, including (if applicable) entering into a Management Agreement with a PC.   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  2.5 Selection of Premises; No Protected Territory; Reservation of Rights.   You and we will mutually select the location of the Premises upon or after the signing of this Agreement. You acknowledge that the Franchise granted by this Agreement gives you the right to operate your Franchise only at the Premises. Although we will not seek to operate or grant others the right to operate a The Joint Corp. Location within the same general area as the Premises, we make no guarantee of any protected territory. Except as otherwise provided in this Paragraph 2.5, we retain all rights with respect to The Joint Corp. Location franchises, the Marks and the System, including (by way of example only and not as a limitation): (a) the right to operate or grant others the right to operate The Joint Corp. Location franchises in any location on terms and conditions we deem appropriate; and (b) the right to operate or offer other healthcare-related companies or franchises or enter into other lines of business offering similar or dissimilar products or services under trademarks or service marks other than the Marks, in any location.   2.6 Renewal of Franchise.   (a) Franchise Owner's Right to Renew. Subject to the provisions of subparagraph 2.6(b) below, and if you have substantially complied with all provisions of this Agreement and all other agreements between us, on expiration of the Initial Term, if you refurbish and decorate the Premises, replace fixtures, furnishings, wall decor, furniture, equipment, and signs and otherwise modify the Franchise in compliance with specifications and standards then applicable under new or renewal franchises for The Joint Corp. Location franchises, you will have the right to renew the Franchise for one (1) additional term of ten (10) years (the \"Renewal Term\").   (b) Notice of Deficiencies and Other Requirements. At least one (1) year before the expiration of the Initial Term, we agree to give you written notice of any deficiencies in your operation or in the historical performance of the Franchise that could cause us not to renew the Franchise. If we will permit renewal, our notice will state what actions, if any, you must take to correct the deficiencies in your operation of the Franchise or of the Premises, and will specify the time period in which those deficiencies must be corrected or other requirements satisfied. Renewal of the Franchise will be conditioned on your continued compliance with all the terms and conditions of this Agreement up to the date of expiration. If we send a notice of non-renewal, it will state the reasons for our refusal to renew.   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (c) Renewal Agreement; Releases. Should you choose to renew the Franchise, you must provide us with written notice of that intent no earlier than two (2) years and no later than one (1) year before the expiration of the Initial Term. To renew the Franchise, the Company, you and your Principal Owners must execute the form of Franchise Agreement and any ancillary agreements we are then customarily using in the grant or renewal of franchises for the operation of The Joint Corp. Location Franchises (with appropriate modifications to reflect the fact that the agreement relates to the grant of a renewal franchise), except that no initial franchise fee will be payable upon renewal of the Franchise. However, you must pay to us a renewal fee equal to 25% of our then-current initial franchise fee for Start-up Locations. You and your Principal Owners and your and their spouses must also execute general releases, in a form satisfactory to us, of any and all claims against us and our affiliates, and our and their respective owners, officers, directors, employees, and agents.   2.7 Personal Guaranty by Principal Owners; Reference to Exhibit 2.

You must submit to us, in the form we specify, a description of the site and such other information or materials as we may reasonably require. We will not unreasonably withhold approval of a site that meets our standards for general location and neighborhood, traffic patterns, parking size, layout and other physical characteristics, for The Joint Corp. Location franchises. Our approval of a site shall not constitute, nor be deemed, a judgment as to the likelihood of success of a The Joint Corp. Location at such location, or a judgment as to the relative desirability of such location in comparison to other locations. If you fail to identify a mutually-agreeable site within the aforementioned six (6) month period, we may terminate this Agreement.   (b) Once we have approved the proposed site of the Premises for your Franchise, you must obtain lawful possession of the Premises through lease or purchase within thirty (30) days of our approval of the Premises. You agree that you will not execute a lease without our advance written approval of the lease terms. The lease for the Premises must include the Addendum to Lease, attached hereto as Exhibit 3, permitting us to take possession of the Premises under certain conditions if this Agreement is terminated or if you violate the terms of the lease.

You agree to use in the development and operation of the Franchise the computer terminals/billing systems and operating software (\"Computer System\") that we specify from time to time. You acknowledge that we may modify such specifications and the components of the Computer System from time to time. As part of the Computer System, we may require you to obtain specified computer hardware and/or software, including without limitation a license to use proprietary software developed by us or others. Our modification of such specifications for the components of the Computer System may require you to incur costs to purchase, lease and/or obtain by license new or modified computer hardware and/or software, and to obtain service and support for the Computer System during the term of this Agreement. You acknowledge that we cannot estimate the future costs of the Computer System (or additions or modifications thereto), and that the cost to you of obtaining the Computer System (or additions or modifications thereto), including software, may not be fully amortizable over the remaining term of this Agreement. Nonetheless, you agree to incur such costs in connection with obtaining the computer hardware and software comprising the Computer System (or additions or modifications thereto). Within sixty (60) days after you receive notice from us, you agree to obtain the components of the Computer System that we designate and require. You further acknowledge and agree that we and our affiliates have the right to charge a reasonable systems fee for software or systems installation services; modifications and enhancements specifically made for us or our affiliates that are licensed to you; and other maintenance and support Computer System-related services that we or our affiliates furnish to you. You will have sole responsibility for: (1) the acquisition, operation, maintenance, and upgrading of your Computer System; (2) the manner in which your Computer System interfaces with our computer system and those of third parties; and (3) any and all consequences that may arise if your Computer System is not properly operated, maintained, and upgraded.   (b) Software. As a franchisee of The Joint Corp., we will provide to you The Joint Corp.'s proprietary office management software (the \"Joint Software\"), which you will be required to install onto the Computer System and use in the daily operation of the Franchise. In addition, we may, at any time and from time to time, contract with one or more software providers, business service providers, or other third parties (individually, a \"Service Provider\") to develop, license, or otherwise provide to or for the use and benefit of you and other The Joint Corp. Franchises certain software, software applications, and software maintenance and support services related to the Computer System that you must or may use in accordance with our instructions with respect to your Computer System.\n\nTHE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  3.5 Equipment, Furniture, Fixtures, Furnishings and Signs.

The opening supervisor will be on site one (1) day before the opening of your first Location and for one (1) day after the opening of your first Location franchise.   4. TRAINING.   4.1 General Manager.   At your request, we may, but are not obligated to, agree for you to employ a general manager to operate the Franchise (\"General Manager\"). The term \"General Manager\" means an individual with primary day-to-day responsibility for the Franchise's operations, and may or may not be you (if you are an individual) or a Principal Owner, officer, director, or employee of yours (if you are other than an individual). We may or may not require that the General Manager have an equity interest in the Franchise. The General Manager will be obligated to devote his or her full time, best efforts, and constant personal attention to the Franchise's operations, and must have full authority from you to implement the System at the Franchise. You must not hire any General Manager or successor General Manager without first receiving our written approval of such General Manager's qualifications. Each General Manager and successor General Manager must attend and complete our Initial Training (as defined herein). No General Manager may have any interest in or business relationship with any business competitor of your franchise. Each General Manager must sign a written agreement, in a form approved by us, to maintain confidential our Confidential Information described in Paragraph 9.1, and to abide by the covenants not to compete described in Paragraph 9.3. You must forward to us a copy of each such signed agreement. If we determine, in our sole discretion, during or following completion of the Initial Training program, that your General Manager (if any) is not qualified to act as General Manager of the Franchise, then we have the right to require you to choose (and obtain our approval of) a new individual for that position.   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  4.2 Training.   You acknowledge that it is very important to the operation of the Franchise that you and your employees receive appropriate training. To that end, you agree as follows:   (a) No later than thirty (30) days before the Franchise opens for business, you must attend our initial training program for your Franchise (the \"Initial Training\") at the time and place we designate. You (if you are an individual) or at least one of your Principal Owners (if you are a legal entity) must complete the Initial Training to our satisfaction. If you employ a General Manager other than yourself or one of your Principal Owners, that General Manager must also complete the Initial Training to our satisfaction. Other employees may complete the Initial Training at your sole discretion and expense, provided you first obtain our approval and subject to availability of facilities and materials. The Initial Training may include classroom instruction and Franchise operation training, and will be furnished at our training facility in Scottsdale, Arizona, a The Joint Corp. Franchise location we designate, your Franchise location, and/or at another location we designate. Our Initial Training programs may be different for each employee depending on their responsibilities at the Franchise. There will be no tuition charge for the persons whom we require to attend any Initial Training program or for any additional personnel of your choosing. All persons who attend our Initial Training must attend and complete the Initial Training to our satisfaction. If we, in our sole discretion, determine that any General Manager or employee whom we require to attend any Initial Training program is unable to satisfactorily complete such program, then you must not hire that person, and must hire a substitute General Manager or employee (as the case may be), who must enroll in the Initial Training program within fifteen (15) days thereafter, and complete the Initial Training to our satisfaction.   (b) You agree to have your General Manager (if any) and/or other employees who attend our Initial Training complete additional training programs at places and times as we may request from time to time during the term of this Agreement.   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (c) In addition to providing the Initial Training described above, we reserve the right to offer and hold such additional ongoing training programs and franchise owners meetings regarding such topics and at such times and locations as we may deem necessary or appropriate. We also reserve the right to make any of these training programs mandatory for you and/or designated owners, employees, and/or representatives of yours. We reserve the right to charge you a daily attendance fee in an amount to be set by us for each attendee of yours who attends any mandatory or optional training program or owners meeting. If we offer any such mandatory training programs, then you or your designated personnel must attend a minimum of seventy-five percent (75%) of the programs offered on an annual basis. In addition to any other remedies we may have, if you fail to attend any required training, we reserve the right to charge you a non-attendance fee of up to $400 per day for each day of mandatory training programs or meetings you miss or fail to attend.   (d) You agree to pay all wages and compensation owed to, and travel, lodging, meal, transportation, and personal expenses incurred by, all of your personnel who attend our Initial Training and/or any mandatory or optional training we provide.

This guidance and assistance may, in our discretion, be furnished in the form of bulletins, written reports and recommendations, operations manuals and other written materials (the \"Operations Manual\"), and/or telephone consultations and/or personal consultations at our offices or your Franchise. If you request\u2014and if we agree to provide\u2014any additional, special on-premises training of your personnel or other assistance in operating your Franchise, then you agree to pay a daily training fee in an amount to be set by us, and all expenses we incur in providing such training or assistance, including any wages or compensation owed to, and travel, lodging, transportation, and living expenses incurred by, our Company personnel.   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  5.2 Operations Manual.   The Operations Manual we lend to you will contain mandatory and suggested specifications, standards, and operating procedures that we prescribe from time to time for your Franchise, as well as information relative to other obligations you have in the operation of the Franchise. The Operations Manual may be composed of or include audio recordings, video recordings, computer disks, compact disks, and/or other written or intangible materials. We may make all or part of the Manual available to you through various means, including the Internet. A previously delivered Operations Manual may be superseded from time to time with replacement materials to reflect changes in the specifications, standards, operating procedures and other obligations in operating the Franchise. You must keep your copy of the Operations Manual current, and if you and we have a dispute over the contents of the Manual, then our master copy of the Manual will control. You agree that you will not at any time copy any part of the Operations Manual, permit it to be copied, disclose it to anyone not having a need to know its contents for purposes of operating your Franchise, or remove it from the Franchise location without our permission. If your copy of the Operations Manual is lost, destroyed, or significantly damaged, then you must obtain a replacement copy for us at our then-applicable charge.   5.3 Modifications to System.   We will continually be reviewing and analyzing developments in the healthcare, and chiropractic industries, as well as developments in fields related to small-business management, and based upon our evaluation of this information, may make changes in the System, including but not limited to, adding new components to services offered and equipment used by The Joint Corp. Location franchises. Moreover, changes in laws regulating the services offered by The Joint Corp. franchises may (a) require us to restructure our franchise program, (b) require your General Manager (if any) and employees to obtain additional licenses or certifications, (c) require you to retain or establish relationships with additional professionals and specialists in the chiropractic and/or healthcare industries, and/or (d) require you to modify your ownership or organizational structure. You agree, at our request, to modify the operation of the Franchise to comply with all such changes, and to be solely responsible for all related costs.   5.4 Advisory Councils.   You agree to participate in, and, if required, become a member of any advisory councils or similar organizations we form or organize for The Joint Corp. Location franchises.\n\nTHE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  6. FEES AND COSTS.   6.1 Initial Franchise Fee.   You agree to pay us the initial franchise fee of Twenty-Nine Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($29,000.00) (the \"Initial Franchise Fee\") when you sign this Agreement. In recognition of the expenses we incur in furnishing assistance and services to you, you agree that we will have fully earned the Initial Franchise Fee, and that is due and non-refundable when you sign this Agreement.   6.2 Royalty Fee.   You agree to pay us a continuing franchise royalty fee (\"Royalty Fee\") in the amount of seven percent (7%) of the gross revenues of the Franchise for all periods, with a minimum monthly amount of Seven Hundred and No/100 Dollars ($700.00). This fee will be payable on the 1st and 16t h of each month based on the Franchise's gross revenues. If the 1 st or 16t h of the month fall on a weekend or holiday, then the fee is payable on the next business day. If, at the end of any calendar month, the total Royalty Fee collected for the preceding month is less than $700.00, the difference between the amount collected and $700.00 shall be due on the tenth (10th) day of the following month. The terms \"gross revenues\" shall, for purposes of this Agreement, mean the total of all revenue and receipts derived from the operation of the Franchise, including all amounts received at or away from the site of the Franchise, or through the business the Franchise conducts (such as fees for chiropractic care, fees for the sale of any service or product, gift certificate sales, and revenue derived from products sales, whether in cash or by check, credit card, debit card, barter or exchange, or other credit transactions); and excludes only sales taxes collected from customers and paid to the appropriate taxing authority, and all customer refunds and credits the Franchise actually makes. For the avoidance of doubt, you specifically acknowledge that \"gross revenues\" includes the gross revenues of any P.C. or any of P.C.'s clinics that are managed by you pursuant to a Management Agreement, even if those revenues are not recognized on your books, and that you are responsible for determining those revenues and paying the Royalty Fee as if those revenues were recognized on your books. You and we acknowledge and agree that the Royalty Fee represents compensation paid by you to us for the guidance and assistance we provide and for the use of our Marks, Confidential Information (as defined herein), know-how, and other intellectual property we allow you to use under the terms of this Agreement. The Royalty Fee does not represent payment for the referral of customers to you, and you acknowledge and agree that the services we offer to you and our other The Joint Corp. franchisees do not include the referral of customers.\n\nTHE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  6.3 Regional and National Advertising Fee.   Recognizing the value of advertising to the goodwill and public image of The Joint Corp. Location franchises, we may, in our sole discretion, establish, maintain and administer one or more regional and/or national advertising funds (the \"Ad Fund(s)\") for such advertising as we may deem necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion. We may, however, choose to use only one Ad Fund to meet the needs of regional, multi- regional, and national advertising and promotional programs. If we establish an Ad Fund, you agree to contribute to the Ad Fund a percentage of gross revenues of the Franchise in an amount we designate from time to time by notice to you, up to a maximum of two percent (2%) of the gross revenues of the Franchise. As of the date of this Agreement, the current required contribution to the Ad Fund is one percent (1%) of the gross revenues of the Franchise. In the event we choose to change the required contribution amount, which we may do at our sole and absolute discretion, up to a maximum of two percent (2%) of gross revenues, we will provide you with thirty (30) days' advance written notice of the change. These advertising fees (\"Advertising Fees\") will be payable with and at the same time as your Royalty Fees payable under Paragraph 6.2 above. A further description of the Ad Fund and your obligations with respect to advertising and promoting the Franchise is found in Section 11 of this Agreement.   6.4 Local Advertising.   (a) By Franchisee. In addition to the Advertising Fees set forth in Paragraph 6.3, which will be used by us to promote The Joint Corp. on a regional and national level, you agree to spend a certain amount on advertising in your local market area. This amount must equal the greater of (a) Three Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($3,000.00); or (b) five percent (5%) of the Franchise's gross revenues for each month during the term of this Agreement (the \"Local Advertising Requirement\"). All proposed local advertising must be submitted to and approved by us before you enter into any advertising agreements. At our request, you must provide us with any documentation we request showing that you have met your monthly Local Advertising Requirement.   (b) Regional Advertising Cooperative. In the event that more than one The Joint Corp. Location franchise is located in an area of dominant influence (\"ADI\"), we reserve the right to form a regional advertising cooperative (the \"Regional Ad Co-op\"), require you to join the Regional Ad Co-op and contribute to its funding. An ADI is a geographic market designation that defines a broadcast media market, consisting of all counties in which the home market stations receive a preponderance of viewing. We reserve the right to determine the amount to be contributed by each member of the Regional Ad Co-op as necessary. The required contributions to any Regional Ad Co-op will not be credited against the Local Advertising Requirement set forth in Paragraph 6.4(a) or 11.2.   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  6.5 Grand Opening Costs.   During sixty (60) day period that begins thirty (30) days prior to the opening of your Franchise, and ending thirty (30) days after the opening of your Franchise (the \"Grand Opening Period\"), you will be required to expend at least Ten Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($10,000.00) in verifiable marketing costs to publicize the grand opening of your Franchise. These costs may include, but are not limited to, signage, local advertising, flyers, promotions, and giveaways. Upon conclusion of the Grand Opening Period, you must send to us a report detailing the amounts spent to publicize the grand opening of your franchise during the Grand Opening Period. All proposed grand opening advertising must be submitted to and approved by us. At our request, you must provide us with any documentation we request showing that you have met the required spend requirement for your Grand Opening.   6.6 Software and Programming Fees.   The initial purchase and installation fee for the Joint Software is Four Hundred Ninety-Five and No/100 Dollars ($495.00), which is payable along with the Initial Franchise Fee. For each month during the term of this Agreement, the on-going license fee for the Joint Software is Two Hundred Seventy-Five and No/100 Dollars ($275.00), which will be debited from the Account on the fifth (5th) day of each month for the preceding month.   6.7 Relocation Fee.   If you must relocate the Premises of your Location for any reason, you must pay to us a Franchise Relocation Fee (the \"Relocation Fee\") of Two Thousand Five Hundred and No/100 Dollars ($2,500.00). The Relocation Fee will help the Company defray the costs of approving a new location, reviewing and approving plans for the new location, and updating Company records and marketing materials to reflect the new location.   6.8 Late Payments.   All Royalty Fees, Advertising Fees, amounts due from you for purchases from us or our affiliates, and other amounts which you owe us or our affiliates (unless otherwise provided for in a separate agreement between us or our affiliates) will begin to accrue interest after their respective due dates at the lesser of (i) the highest commercial contract interest rate permitted by state law, and (ii) the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum. In addition to any accruing interest, all late payments will incur a late charge of Fifty and No/100 Dollars ($50.00) per day until the payment is made. Payments due us or our affiliates will not be deemed received until such time as funds from the deposit of any check by us or our affiliates is collected from your account. You acknowledge that the inclusion of this Paragraph in this Agreement does not mean we agree to accept or condone late payments, nor does it indicate that we have any intention to extend credit to, or otherwise finance your operation of the Franchise. We have the right to require that any payments due us or our affiliates be made by certified or cashier's check in the event that any payment by check is not honored by the bank upon which the check is drawn. We also reserve the right to charge you a fee of One Hundred and No/100 Dollars ($100.00) for any payment by check that is not honored by the bank upon which it is drawn.   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  6.9 Electronic Funds Transfer.   We have the right to require you to participate in an electronic funds transfer program under which Royalty Fees, Advertising Fees, and any other amounts payable to us or our affiliates are deducted or paid electronically from your bank account (the \"Account\"). In the event you are required to authorize us to initiate debit entries, you agree to make the funds available in the Account for withdrawal by electronic transfer no later than the payment due date. The amount actually transferred from the Account to pay Royalty Fees and Advertising Fees will be based on the Franchise's gross revenues as reported in the Franchise's practice management software. If you have not properly input the Franchise's gross revenues for any reporting period, then we will be authorized to debit the Account in an amount equal to one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the Royalty Fee, Advertising Fee, and other amounts transferred from the Account for the last reporting period for which a report of the Franchise's gross revenues was provided to us. If at any time we determine that you have under-reported the Franchise's gross revenues or underpaid any Royalty Fee or Advertising Fee due us under this Agreement, then we will be authorized to initiate immediately a debit to the Account in the appropriate amount, plus applicable interest, in accordance with the foregoing procedure. Any overpayment will be credited, without interest, against the Royalty Fee, Advertising Fee, and other amounts we otherwise would debit from your account during the following reporting period. Our use of electronic funds transfers as a method of collecting Royalty Fees and Advertising Fees due us does not constitute a waiver of any of your obligations to provide us with weekly reports as provided in Section 12, nor shall it be deemed a waiver of any of the rights and remedies available to us under this Agreement.   6.10 Application of Payments.   When we receive a payment from you, we have the right in our sole discretion to apply it as we see fit to any past due indebtedness of yours due to us or our affiliates, whether for Royalty Fees, Advertising Fees, purchases, interest, or for any other reason, regardless of how you may designate a particular payment should be applied.\n\nTHE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  6.11 Modification of Payments.   If, by operation of law or otherwise, any fees contemplated by this Agreement cannot be based upon gross revenues, then you and we agree to negotiate in good faith an alternative fee arrangement. If you and we are unable to reach an agreement on an alternative fee arrangement, then the Company reserves the right to terminate this Agreement upon notice to you, in which case all of the post-termination obligations set forth in Section 16 shall apply.   6.12 Non-Compliance Charge.   In addition to our other rights and remedies, we may charge you a non-compliance charge in an amount up to five hundred dollars ($500) per violation by you of any term or condition of this Agreement, including, without limitation, failure to pay (or to have adequate amounts available for electronic transfer of) amounts owed to Franchisor or Franchisor's affiliates or failure to timely provide required reports, or failure to obtain prior approval from Franchisor whenever Franchisor approval is required (i.e., advertising).   7. MARKS.   7.1 Ownership and Goodwill of Marks.   You acknowledge that your right to use the Marks is derived solely from this Agreement, and is limited to your operation of the Franchise pursuant to and in compliance with this Agreement and all applicable standards, specifications, and operating procedures we prescribe from time to time during the term of the Franchise. You understand and acknowledge that our right to regulate the use of the Marks includes, without limitation, any use of the Marks in any form of electronic media, such as Websites (as defined herein) or web pages, or as a domain name or electronic media identifier. If you make any unauthorized use of the Marks, it will constitute a breach of this Agreement and an infringement of our rights in and to the Marks. You acknowledge and agree that all your usage of the Marks and any goodwill established by your use will inure exclusively to our benefit and the benefit of our affiliates, and that this Agreement does not confer any goodwill or other interests in the Marks on you (other than the right to operate the Franchise in compliance with this Agreement). All provisions of this Agreement applicable to the Marks will apply to any additional trademarks, service marks, commercial symbols, designs, artwork, or logos we may authorize and/or license you to use during the term of this Agreement.   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  7.2 Limitations on Franchise Owner's Use of Marks.

Any such information disclosed to or developed by you will be referred to in this Agreement as \"Confidential Information\".   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  9.2 Non-Disclosure Agreement.   You agree that your relationship with us does not vest in you any interest in the Confidential Information, other than the right to use it in the development and operation of the Franchise, and that the use or duplication of the Confidential Information in any other business would constitute an unfair method of competition. You acknowledge and agree that the Confidential Information belongs to us, may contain trade secrets belonging to us, and is disclosed to you or authorized for your use solely on the condition that you agree, and you therefore do agree, that you (1) will not use the Confidential Information in any other business or capacity; (2) will maintain the absolute confidentiality of the Confidential Information during and after the term of this Agreement; (3) will not make unauthorized copies of any portion of the Confidential Information disclosed in written form or another form that may be copied or duplicated; and (4) will adopt and implement all reasonable procedures we may prescribe from time to time to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information, including without limitation restrictions on disclosure to your employees, and the use of non-disclosure and non-competition agreements we may prescribe or approve for your shareholders, partners, members, officers, directors, employees, independent contractors, or agents who may have access to the Confidential Information.   9.3 Non-Competition Agreement.   You agree that we would be unable to protect the Confidential Information against unauthorized use or disclosure, and would be unable to encourage a free exchange of ideas and information among The Joint Corp. franchises, if franchise owners of The Joint Corp. franchises were permitted to hold interests in any competitive businesses (as described below).

Location franchises. The ownership of one percent (1%) or less of a publicly traded company will not be deemed to be prohibited by this Paragraph.

Locations, and have undertaken a plan to make the proposed change in the balance of such Company and affiliate-owned Locations (any expenditures incurred pursuant to this Paragraph 10.1(f) shall apply to the requirement in Paragraph 10.1(e));   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (g) you will place or display at the Premises (interior and exterior) only those signs, emblems, designs, artwork, lettering, logos, and display and advertising materials that we from time to time approve; and   (h) if at any time in our reasonable judgment, the general state of repair, appearance, or cleanliness of the premises of the Franchise or its fixtures, equipment, furniture, or signs do not meet our standards, then we shall have the right to notify you specifying the action you must take to correct the deficiency. If you do not initiate action to correct such deficiencies within (ten) 10 days after receipt of our notice, and then continue in good faith and with due diligence, a bona fide program to complete any required maintenance or refurbishing, then we shall have the right, in addition to all other remedies available to us at law or under this Agreement, to enter the Premises or the Franchise and perform any required maintenance or refurbishing on your behalf, and you agree to reimburse us on demand.   10.2 Franchise Services and Products.   You agree that (a) the Franchise will offer for sale all services and products that we from time to time specify for Locations, (b) the Franchise will offer and sell approved services and products only in the manner we have prescribed; (c) you will not offer for sale or sell at the Franchise, the Premises, or any other location any services or products we have not approved; (d) all products will be offered at retail prices, and you will not offer or sell any products at wholesale prices; (e) you will not use the Premises for any purpose other than the operation of the Franchise; and (f) you will discontinue selling and offering for sale any services or products that we at any time decide (in our sole discretion) to disapprove in writing.

You agree to maintain an inventory of approved products sufficient in quantity and variety to realize the full potential of the Franchise. We may, from time to time, conduct market research and testing to determine consumer trends and the saleability of new services and products. You agree to cooperate by participating in our market research programs, test marketing new services and products in the Franchise, and providing us with timely reports and other relevant information regarding such market research. In connection with any such test marketing, you agree to offer a reasonable quantity of the products or services being tested, and effectively promote and make a reasonable effort to sell them.   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  10.3 Approved Products, Distributors and Suppliers.   We have developed or may develop various unique products or services that may be prepared according to our formulations. We have approved, and will continue to periodically approve, specifications for suppliers and distributors (which may include us and/or our affiliates) for products or services required to be purchased by, or offered and sold at, The Joint Corp. Location franchises, that meet our standards and requirements, including without limitation standards and requirements relating to product quality, prices, consistency, reliability, and customer relations.

Your failure or refusal to do so shall constitute a breach of this Agreement.   We may approve a single distributor or other supplier (collectively \"supplier\") for any product, and may approve a supplier only as to certain products. We may concentrate purchases with one or more suppliers to obtain lower prices or the best advertising support or services for any group of The Joint Corp. Locations franchised or operated by us. Approval of a supplier may be conditioned on requirements relating to the frequency of delivery, concentration of purchases, standards of service (including prompt attention to complaints), or other criteria, and may be temporary, pending our continued evaluation of the supplier from time to time.   If you would like to purchase any items from any unapproved supplier, then you must submit to us a written request for approval of the proposed supplier. We have the right to inspect the proposed supplier's facilities, and require that product samples from the proposed supplier be delivered, at our option, either directly to us, or to any independent, certified laboratory that we may designate, for testing. We may charge you a supplier evaluation fee (not to exceed the reasonable cost of the inspection and the actual cost of the test) to make the evaluation. We reserve the right to periodically re-inspect the facilities and products of any approved supplier, and revoke our approval if the supplier does not continue to meet any of our criteria.   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  We and/or our affiliates may be an approved supplier of certain products or services to be purchased by you for use and/or sale by the Franchise. We and our affiliates reserve the right to charge any licensed manufacturer engaged by us or our affiliates a royalty to manufacture products for us or our affiliates, or to receive commissions or rebates from vendors that supply goods or services to you. We or our affiliates may also derive income from our sale of products or services to you, and may sell these items at prices exceeding our or their costs in order to make a profit on the sale.   10.4 Hours of Operation.   You agree to keep the Franchise open for business at such times and during such hours as we may prescribe from time to time.   10.5 Specifications, Standards and Procedures.   You agree to comply with all mandatory specifications, standards, and operating procedures relating to the appearance, function, cleanliness, sanitation and operation of the Franchise.

All references to \"this Agreement\" include all such mandatory specifications, standards, and operating procedures.   10.6 Compliance with Laws and Good Business Practices.   You agree to secure and maintain in force in your name all required licenses, permits and certificates relating to the operation of the Franchise. You also agree to operate the Franchise in full compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, and regulations, including without limitation all government regulations relating to worker's compensation insurance, unemployment insurance, and withholding and payment of federal and state income taxes, social security taxes, and sales taxes.   All advertising you employ must be completely factual, in good taste (in our judgment), and conform to the highest standards of ethical advertising and all legal requirements. You agree that in all dealings with us and any of our affiliates, other franchisees, your customers, your suppliers, and public officials, you will adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, fair dealing and ethical conduct. You further agree to refrain from any business or advertising practice that may be harmful to the business of the Company, the Franchise, and/or the goodwill associated with the Marks and other The Joint Corp. franchises.   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  You must notify us in writing within 5 days of (1) the commencement of any action, suit, or proceeding, and/or of the issuance of any order, writ, injunction, award, or decree of any court, agency, or other governmental unit, that may adversely affect your and/or the Franchise's operation, financial condition, or reputation; and/or (2) your receipt or knowledge any notice of violation of any law, ordinance, or regulation relating to health or safety.   10.7 Management and Personnel of the Franchise.   Unless we approve your employment of a General Manager to operate the Franchise as provided in Paragraph 4.1, you must actively participate in the actual, on-site, day-to-day operation of the Franchise, and devote as much of your time as is reasonably necessary for the efficient operation of the Franchise. If you are other than an individual, then at least one (1) Principal Owner, director, officer, or other employee of you whom we approve must comply with the this requirement. If we agree that you may employ a General Manager, then the General Manager must fulfill this requirement. Any General Manager shall each obtain all licenses and certifications required by law before assuming his or her responsibilities at the Franchise. You will ensure that your employees and independent contractors of the Franchise have any licenses as may be required by law, and hold or are pursuing any licenses, certifications, and/or degrees required by law or by us in the Operations Manual, as updated from time to time. You will be exclusively responsible for the terms of your employees' and independent contractors' employment and compensation, and for the proper training of your employees and independent contractors in the operation of the Franchise. You must establish any training programs for your employees and/or independent contractors that we may prescribe in writing from time to time. You must require all employees and independent contractors to maintain a neat and clean appearance, and conform to the standards of dress that we specify in the Operations Manual, as updated from time to time. Each of your employees and independent contractors must sign a written agreement, in a form approved by us, to maintain confidential our Confidential Information, proprietary information, and trade secrets as described in Paragraph 9.1, and to abide by the covenants not to compete described in Paragraph 9.3. You must forward to us a copy of each such signed agreement. All of your employees and independent contractors must render prompt, efficient and courteous service to all customers of the Franchise. You agree not to recruit or hire, either directly or indirectly, any employee (or a former employee, for sixty (60) days after his or her employment has ended) of any The Joint Corp. Location franchise operated by us, our affiliates, or another The Joint Corp. franchise owner without first obtaining the written consent of us, our affiliate, or the franchise owner that currently employs (or previously employed) such employee. If you violate this provision, in addition to any other right or remedy we may have, you agree to pay the employee's current or former employer twice the employee's annual salary, plus all costs and attorneys' fees incurred as a result of the violation. This amount is set at twice the employee's annual salary because it is a reasonable estimation of the damages that would occur from such a breach, and it will almost certainly be impossible to calculate precisely the actual damages from such a breach.   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  10.8 Insurance.

Best rating of A-VIII or better approved by us, and in such amounts as we may determine from time to time: (1) comprehensive public, professional, product, medical malpractice and motor vehicle liability insurance against claims for bodily and personal injury, death and property damage caused by or occurring in conjunction with the operation of the Franchise or otherwise in conjunction with your conduct of the Franchise Business pursuant to this Agreement, under one or more policies of insurance containing minimum liability coverage amounts as set forth in the Operations Manual; (2) general casualty insurance, including theft, cash theft, fire and extended coverage, vandalism and malicious mischief insurance, for the replacement value of the Franchise and its contents, and any other assets of the Franchise; (3) worker's compensation and employer's liability insurance as required by law, with limits equal to or in excess of those required by statute; (4) business interruption insurance for a period adequate to reestablish normal business operations, but in any event not less than six (6) months; (5) any other insurance required by applicable law, rule, regulation, ordinance or licensing requirements; and (6) umbrella liability coverage with limits of not less than $1,000,000/$3,000,000 or such other amounts that we may establish in the Operations Manual. You must purchase such insurance coverage(s) only from our approved or designated supplier(s). We may periodically increase or decrease the amounts of coverage required under these insurance policies, and/or require different or additional kinds of insurance, including excess liability insurance, to reflect inflation, identification of new risks, changes in law or standards of liability, higher damage awards, or other relevant changes in circumstances.   Each insurance policy must name us (and, if we so request, our members, directors, employees, agents, and affiliates) as additional insureds, and must provide us with thirty (30) days' advance written notice of any material modification, cancellation, or expiration of the policy. Deductibles must be in reasonable amounts, and are subject to review and written approval by us. You must provide us with copies of policies evidencing the existence of such insurance concurrently with execution of this Agreement and prior to each subsequent renewal date of each insurance policy, along with certificates evidencing such insurance. You are responsible for any and all claims, losses or damages, including to third persons, originating from, in connection with, or caused by your failure to name us as an additional insured on each insurance policy. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold us harmless of, from, and with respect to any such claims, loss or damage arising out of your failure to name us as additional insured, which indemnity shall survive the termination or expiration and non-renewal of this Agreement.

If you at any time fail or refuse to maintain any insurance coverage required by us or to furnish satisfactory evidence thereof, then we, at our option and in addition to our other rights and remedies under this Agreement, may, but need not, obtain such insurance coverage on your behalf, and you shall reimburse us on demand for any costs or premiums paid or incurred by us, including any administrative fees or surcharges that we may incur. If you fail to pay us within ten (10) days of our demand for reimbursement, we reserve the right to debit your account the amounts owed to us for any premiums paid on your behalf for such insurance coverage along with any other costs, surcharges expenses and fees we incur to obtain such coverage on your behalf or on behalf of your franchise. We reserve the right to require you to provide us with an application for insurance (in a form acceptable to our required supplier for insurance) for any medical professional that has been offered a position to work in a Franchise location so that we may, if you fail to do so, procure any necessary insurance coverage for such medical professional.   Notwithstanding the existence of such insurance, you are and will be responsible for all loss or damage and contractual liability to third persons originating from or in connection with the operation of the Franchise, and for all claims or demands for damages to property or for injury, illness or death of persons directly or indirectly resulting therefrom; and you agree to defend, indemnify and hold us harmless of, from, and with respect to any such claims, loss or damage, which indemnity shall survive the termination or expiration and non-renewal of this Agreement. In addition to the requirements of the foregoing paragraphs of this Paragraph 10.8, you must maintain any and all insurance coverage in such amounts and under such terms and conditions as may be required in connection with your lease or purchase of the Premises.   Your obligation to maintain insurance coverage as described in this Agreement will not be reduced in any manner by reason of any separate insurance we maintain on our own behalf, nor will our maintenance of that insurance relieve you of any obligations under Section 7 of this Agreement.   10.9 Credit Cards and Other Methods of Payment.   You must at all times have arrangements in existence with Visa, Master Card, American Express, Discover and any other credit and debit card issuers or sponsors, check verification services, and electronic fund transfer systems that we designate from time to time, in order that the Franchise may accept customers' credit and debit cards, checks, and other methods of payment. We may require you to obtain such services through us or our affiliates.   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  10.10 Pricing.   To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may periodically establish maximum and/or minimum prices for services and products that the Franchise location offers, including without limitation, prices for promotions in which all or certain The Joint Franchise locations participate. If we establish such prices for any services or products, you agree not to exceed or reduce that price, but will charge the price for the service or product that we establish. You hereby agree to apply any pricing matrix or schedule established by us. If you wish to offer an alternate pricing matrix, you must obtain our prior written approval. In states where you must enter a Management Agreement (Section 2.3), this provision shall be modified, to the extent legally permissible, and/or legally construed to conform to the laws of the state where your Franchise location will be located.   11. ADVERTISING.   11.1 By Company.   As stated in Paragraph 6.3, due to the value of advertising and the importance of promoting the public image of The Joint Corp. Location franchises, we will establish, maintain, and administer one or more Ad Funds to support and pay for national, regional, and/or local marketing programs that we deem necessary, desirable, or appropriate to promote the goodwill and image of all The Joint Corp. Location franchises. You will contribute to the Ad Fund the Advertising Fee set forth in Section 6.3. We agree that any Locations owned by us or our affiliates will contribute to the Ad Fund on at least the same basis as you do.   We will be entitled to direct all advertising programs financed by the Ad Fund, with sole discretion over the creative concepts, materials, and endorsements used in them, and the geographic, market, and media placement and allocation of the programs. We will have the sole discretion to use the Ad Fund to pay the costs of preparing and producing video, audio, and written advertising materials; administering regional, multi- regional and/or national advertising programs; including purchasing direct mail and other media advertising; employing advertising agencies and supporting public relations, market research, and other advertising and marketing firms; and paying for advertising and marketing activities that we deem appropriate, including the costs of participating in any national or regional trade shows. and providing advertising and marketing materials to The Joint Corp. Location franchises. We may in our discretion use the Ad Fund to engage in advertising and promotional programs that benefit only one or several regionals, and not necessarily all Location franchises Ad Funds. The Ad Fund will furnish you with approved advertising materials at its direct cost of producing those advertising materials. The amounts you contribute to the Ad Fund will not be used for placement of advertising in television, radio, newspaper or other media. Rather, any collective media placement will be conducted through the local and regional advertising cooperatives described in Section 11.3.   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  The Ad Fund will be accounted for separately from other funds of the Company, and will not be used to defray any of our general operating expenses, except for any reasonable salaries, administrative costs, and overhead we may incur in activities reasonably related to the administration of the Ad Fund and its advertising programs (including without limitation conducting market research, preparing advertising and marketing materials, and collecting and accounting for contributions to the Ad Fund). We may spend in any fiscal year an amount greater or less than the total contributions to the Ad Fund in that year. We may cause the Ad Fund to borrow from us or other lenders to cover deficits of the Ad Fund, or to invest any surplus for future use by the Ad Fund. You authorize us to collect for remission to the Ad Fund any advertising monies or credits offered by any supplier to you based upon purchases you make. We will prepare an annual statement of monies collected and costs incurred by the Ad Fund and will make it available to you on written request.   You understand and acknowledge that the Ad Fund will be intended to maximize recognition of the Marks and patronage of The Joint Corp. Location franchises. Although we will endeavor to use the Ad Fund to develop advertising and marketing materials, and to place advertising in a manner that will benefit all The Joint Corp. Location franchises, we undertake no obligation to ensure that expenditures by the Ad Fund in or affecting any geographic area are proportionate or equivalent to contributions to the Ad Fund by The Joint Corp. Location franchises operating in that geographic area, or that any The Joint Corp. Location franchise will benefit directly or in proportion to its contribution to the Ad Fund from the development of advertising and marketing materials or the placement of advertising. Except as expressly provided in this Paragraph, we assume no direct or indirect liability or obligation to you with respect to the maintenance, direction, or administration of the Ad Fund.   We will have the right to terminate the Ad Fund by giving you thirty (30) days' advance written notice. All unspent monies on date of termination will be divided between the Company and the contributing The Joint Corp. Location franchisees in proportion to our and their respective contributions. At any time thereafter, we will have the right to reinstate the Ad Fund under the same terms and conditions as described in this Section (including the rights to terminate and reinstate the Ad Fund) by giving you thirty (30) days' advance written notice of reinstatement.   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  11.2 By Franchise Owner.   You must spend, in addition to any contributions to the Ad Fund, a minimum of the greater of (a) Three Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($3,000.00); or (b) five percent (5%) of the Franchise's gross revenues for each month during the term of this Agreement, as outlined in Paragraph 6.4, for local advertising, promotion and marketing. You must provide us (in a form we approve or designate) evidence of your required local advertising, marketing and promotional expenditures by the thirtieth (30th) day of each month, for the preceding calendar month, along with a year- to-date report of the total amount spent on local advertising.   You agree to list and advertise the Franchise in each of the classified telephone directories distributed within your market area, in those business classifications as we prescribe from time to time, using any standard form of classified telephone directory advertisement we may provide.   On each occasion before you use them, samples of all local advertising and promotional materials not prepared or previously approved by us must be submitted to us for approval. If you do not receive our written disapproval within fifteen (15) days from the date we receive the materials, the materials will be deemed to have been approved. You agree not to use any advertising or promotional materials that we have disapproved. You will be solely responsible and liable to ensure that all advertising, marketing, and promotional materials and activities you prepare comply with applicable federal, state, and local law, and the conditions of any agreements or orders to which you may be subject.   11.3 Regional Advertising Cooperatives.   In the event that more than one The Joint Corp. Location franchise is located in an area of dominant influence (\"ADI\"), we reserve the right to form a regional advertising cooperative (the \"Regional Ad Co-op\"). We also reserve the right to require you to join the Regional Ad Co-op and to contribute to its funding. We reserve the right to determine the amount to be contributed by each member of the Regional Ad Co-op as necessary. The required contributions to any Regional Ad Co-op will not be credited against the Local Advertising Requirement set forth in Paragraphs 6.4(a) and 11.2.   11.4 Websites and Other Forms of Advertising Media.   You acknowledge and agree that any Website or Other Forms of Advertising Media (as defined below) will be deemed \"advertising\" under this Agreement, and will be subject to, among other things, the need to obtain our prior written approval in accordance with Paragraphs 7.2 and 11.2. As used in this Agreement, the term or reference to \"Website or Other Forms of Advertising Media\" means any interactive system, including but not limited to all types of online communications, virtual applications, social media, or the like, including but not limited to Groupon, Living Social, Facebook, Twitter, etc., that you operate or use, or authorize others to operate or use, and that refer to the Franchise, the Marks, us, and/or the System. The term or reference Website or Other Forms of Advertising Media includes, but is not limited to, Internet and World Wide Web home pages. In connection with any Website or Other Forms of Advertising Media, you agree to the following:   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (a) Before establishing any Website or Other Form of Advertising Media, you will submit to us a sample of such Website or Other Form of Advertising Media format and information in the form and manner we may require.   (b) You will not establish or use any Website or Other Forms of Advertising Media without our prior written approval.

If we require, you will establish a website as part of our corporate website and/or establish electronic links to our corporate website.   (d) If you propose any material revision to Website or Other Forms of Advertising Media or any of the information contained therein, you will submit each such revision to us for our prior written approval.   12. ACCOUNTING, REPORTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.   You agree to maintain, at your own expense, the Joint Software and accounting software, to act as a bookkeeping, accounting, and record keeping system for the Franchise. The Joint Software includes the capability of being polled by our central computer system, which you agree to permit. With respect to the operation and financial condition of the Franchise, we will pull from the Joint Software (if available), or require you to provide from your accounting software in a form we designate, or in accordance with General Acceptably Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), as the case may be, the following: (1) by Tuesday of each week, an electronic report of the Franchise's gross revenues for the preceding week ending on, and including, Sunday, and any other data, information, and supporting records that we may require; (2) by the thirtieth (30 t h) day of each month, a profit and loss statement for the preceding calendar month, and a year-to-date profit and loss statement and balance sheet; (3) within ninety (90) days after the end of your fiscal year, a fiscal year-end balance sheet, and an annual profit and loss statement for that fiscal year, reflecting all year- end adjustments; and (4) such other reports as we require from time to time (collectively, the \"Reports\"). You agree to input all Franchise transactions into the Joint Software and your accounting software in a timely manner to ensure that all Reports are accurate. If it is determined that any information was omitted from the Joint Software or your accounting software was input inaccurately, or you have failed to provide us any required Reports, we may charge a non-refundable accounting fee of One Hundred and No/100 Dollars ($100.00), payable in a lump sum by the fifth (5th) day of the month following the month during which the inaccurate report was submitted or for any late Reports. You agree to maintain and furnish upon our request complete copies of federal and state income tax returns you file with the Internal Revenue Service and state tax departments, reflecting revenues and income of the Franchise or the corporation, partnership, or limited liability company that holds the Franchise. We reserve the right to require you to have audited or reviewed financial statements prepared by a certified public accountant on an annual basis. You agree to retain hard copies of all records for a minimum of four (4) years.   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  13. INSPECTIONS AND AUDITS.   13.1 Company's Right to Inspect the Franchise.   To determine whether you and the Franchise are complying with this Agreement and the specifications, standards, and operating procedures we prescribe for the operation of the Franchise, we or our agents have the right, at any reasonable time and without advance notice to you, to: (1) inspect the Premises; (2) observe the operations of the Franchise for such consecutive or intermittent periods as we deem necessary; (3) interview personnel of the Franchise; (4) interview customers of the Franchise; and (5) inspect and copy any books, records and documents relating to the operation of the Franchise. You agree to fully cooperate with us in connection with any of those inspections, observations and interviews. You agree to present to your customers any evaluation forms we periodically prescribe, and agree to participate in, and/or request that your customers participate in, any surveys performed by or on our behalf. Based on the results of any such inspections and audits and your other reports, we may provide to you such guidance and assistance in operating your Franchise as we deem appropriate.   13.2 Company's Right to Audit.   We have the right at any time during business hours, and without advance notice to you, to inspect and audit, or cause to be inspected and audited, the business records, bookkeeping and accounting records, sales and income tax records and returns and other records of the Franchise, and the books and records of any corporation, limited liability company, or partnership that holds the Franchise. You agree to fully cooperate with our representatives and any independent accountants we may hire to conduct any inspection or audit. If the inspection or audit is necessary because of your failure to furnish any reports, supporting records, other information or financial statements as required by this Agreement, or to furnish such reports, records, information, or financial statements on a timely basis, or if an understatement of gross revenues for any period is determined by an audit or inspection to be greater than two percent (2%), then you agree to pay us all monies owed, plus interest of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, and reimburse us for the cost of such inspection or audit, including without limitation any attorneys' fees and/or accountants' fees we may incur, and the travel expenses, room and board, and applicable per diem charges for our employees or contractors. The above remedies are in addition to all our other remedies and rights under this Agreement or under applicable law.   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  14. TRANSFER REQUIREMENTS.   14.1 Organization.   If you are a corporation, partnership or limited liability company (or if this Agreement is assigned to a corporation, partnership or limited liability company with our approval), you represent and warrant to us that you are and will continue to be throughout the term of this Agreement, duly organized and validly existing in good standing under the laws of the state of your incorporation, registration or organization, that you are qualified to do business and will continue to be qualified to do business throughout the term of this Agreement in all states in which you are required to qualify, that you have the authority to execute, deliver and carry out all of the terms of this Agreement, and that during the term of this Agreement the only business you (i.e., the corporate, partnership or limited liability entity) will conduct will be the development, ownership and operation of the Franchise.   14.2 Interests in Franchise Owner; Reference to Exhibit 4.   You and each Principal Owner represent, warrant and agree that all \"Interests\" in Franchise Owner are owned in the amount and manner described in Exhibit 4. No Interests in Franchise Owner will, during the term of this Agreement, be \"public\" securities (i.e., securities that require, for their issuance, registration with any state or federal authority). (An \"Interest\" is defined to mean any shares, membership interests, or partnership interests of Franchise Owner and any other equitable or legal right in any of Franchise Owner's stock, revenues, profits, rights or assets. When referring to Franchise Owner's rights or assets, an \"Interest\" means this Agreement, Franchise Owner's rights under and interest in this Agreement, any The Joint Corp. franchise, or the revenues, profits or assets of any The Joint Corp. franchise.) You and each Principal Owner also represent, warrant, and agree that no Principal Owner's Interest has been given as security for any obligation (i.e., no one has a lien on or security interest in a Principal Owner's Interest), and that no change will be made in the ownership of an Interest other than as expressly permitted by this Agreement or as we may otherwise approve in writing. You and each Principal Owner agree to furnish us with such evidence as we may request from time to time to assure ourselves that the Interests of Franchise Owner and each of your Principal Owners remain as permitted by this Agreement, including a list of all persons or entities owning any Interest, as defined above. If you have transferred your Interests in violation of this Agreement you shall be considered in breach of this Agreement.   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  14.3 Transfer by Company.   This Agreement is fully transferable by us and will inure to the benefit of any person or entity to whom it is transferred, or to any other legal successor to our interests in this Agreement.   14.4 No Transfer Without Approval.   You understand and acknowledge that the rights and duties created by this Agreement are personal to you and that we have entered into this Agreement in reliance on the individual or collective character, skill, aptitude, attitude, business ability, and financial capacity of you and your Principal Owners. Accordingly, neither this Agreement nor any part of your interest in it, nor any Interest (as defined in Paragraph 14.2) of Franchise Owner or a Principal Owner, may be transferred (see definition below) without our advance written approval if such transfer will result in the Principal Owner(s) set forth in Exhibit 4 holding less than a seventy-five percent (75%) Interest in Franchise Owner. Any Transfer that is made without our approval will constitute a breach of this Agreement and convey no rights to or interests in this Agreement, you, the Franchise, or any other The Joint Corp. franchise.   As used in this Agreement the term \"Transfer\" means any voluntary, involuntary, direct or indirect assignment, sale, gift, exchange, grant of a security interest, or occurrence of any other event which would or might change the ownership of any Interest, and includes, without limitation: (1) the Transfer of ownership of capital stock, partnership interest or other ownership interest (including the granting of options (such as stock options or any option which give anyone ownership rights now or in the future); (2) merger or consolidation, or issuance of additional securities representing an ownership interest in Franchise Owner; (3) sale of common stock of Franchise Owner sold pursuant to a private placement or registered public offering; (4) Transfer of an Interest in a divorce proceeding or otherwise by operation of law; or (5) Transfer of an Interest by will, declaration of or transfer in trust, or under the laws of intestate succession.   We will not unreasonably withhold consent to a Transfer of an Interest by a Principal Owner to a member of his or her immediate family or to your key employees, so long as all Principal Owners together retain a \"controlling Interest\" (i.e., the minimum ownership percentage listed in Exhibit 4), although we reserve the right to impose reasonable conditions on the Transfer as a requirement for our consent.   Interests owned by persons other than the Principal Owners (\"minority owners\") may be Transferred without our advance consent unless the Transfer would give that transferee and any person or group of persons affiliated or having a common interest with the transferee more than a collective twenty-five percent (25%) Interest in Franchise Owner, in which case our advance written approval for the Transfer must be obtained. Your formal partnership, corporation or other formation documents and all stock certificates, partnership units or other evidence of ownership must recite or bear a legend reflecting the transfer restrictions of this Paragraph 14.4.   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  14.5 Conditions for Approval of Transfer.   If you and your Principal Owners are in full compliance with this Agreement, we will not unreasonably withhold our approval of a Transfer that meets all the applicable requirements of this Section 14. The person or entity to whom you wish to make the Transfer, or its principal owners (\"Proposed New Owner\"), must be individuals of good moral character and otherwise meet our then-applicable standards for The Joint Corp. Location franchisees. If you propose to Transfer this Agreement, the Franchise or its assets, or any Interest, or if any of your Principal Owners proposes to Transfer a controlling Interest in you or make a Transfer that is one of a series of Transfers which taken together would constitute the Transfer of a controlling Interest in you, then all of the following conditions must be met before or at the time of the Transfer:   (a) the Proposed New Owner must have sufficient business experience, aptitude, and financial resources to operate the Franchise;   (b) you must pay any amounts owed for purchases from us and our affiliates, and any other amounts owed to us or our affiliates which are unpaid;   (c) the Proposed New Owner's directors and such other personnel as we may designate must have successfully completed our Initial Training program, and shall be legally authorized and have all licenses necessary to perform the services offered by the Franchise. The Proposed New Owner shall be responsible for any wages and compensation owed to, and the travel and living expenses (including all transportation costs, room, board and meals) incurred by, the attendees who attend the Initial Training program;   (d) if your lease for the Premises requires it, the lessor must have consented to the assignment of the lease of the Premises to the Proposed New Owner;   (e) you (or the Proposed New Owner) must pay us a Transfer fee equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the then current initial franchise fee we charge to new Start-up Location franchisees, and must reimburse us for any reasonable expenses incurred by us in investigating and processing any Proposed New Owner where the Transfer is not consummated for any reason;   (f) you and your Principal Owners and your and their spouses must execute a general release (in a form satisfactory to us) of any and all claims you and/or they may have against us, our affiliates, and our and our affiliates' respective officers, directors, employees, and agents;   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (g) we must approve the material terms and conditions of the proposed Transfer, including without limitation that the price and terms of payment are not so burdensome as to adversely affect the operation of the Franchise;   (h) the Franchise and the Premises shall have been placed in an attractive, neat and sanitary condition;   (i) you and your Principal Owners must enter into an agreement with us providing that all obligations of the Proposed New Owner to make installment payments of the purchase price (and any interest on it) to you or your Principal Owners will be subordinate to the obligations of the Proposed New Owner to pay any amounts payable under this Agreement or any new Franchise Agreement that we may require the Proposed New Owner to sign in connection with the Transfer;   (j) you and your Principal Owners must enter into a non-competition agreement wherein you agree not to engage in a competitive business for a period of two (2) years after the Transfer and within twenty-five (25) miles of your Franchise Premises or any other The Joint Corp. Location franchise location;   (k) the Franchise shall have been determined by us to contain all equipment and fixtures in good working condition, as were required at the initial opening of the Franchise. The Proposed New Owner shall have agreed, in writing, to make such reasonable capital expenditures to remodel, equip, modernize and redecorate the interior and exterior of the premises in accordance with our then existing plans and specifications for a The Joint Corp. Location franchise, and shall have agreed to pay our expenses for plan preparation or review, and site inspection;   (l)  upon receiving our consent for the Transfer or sale of the Franchise, the Proposed New Owner shall agree to assume all of your obligations under this Agreement in a form acceptable to us, or, at our option, shall agree to execute a new Franchise Agreement with us in the form then being used by us. We may, at our option, require that you guarantee the performance, and obligations of the Proposed New Owner; and   (m) you must have properly offered us the opportunity to exercise our right of first refusal as described below, and we must have then declined to exercise it.   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  14.6 Right of First Refusal.   If you or any of your Principal Owners wishes to Transfer any Interest, we will have a right of first refusal to purchase that Interest as follows. The party proposing the Transfer (the \"transferor\") must obtain a bona fide, executed written offer (accompanied by a \"good faith\" earnest money deposit of at least five percent (5%) of the proposed purchase price) from a responsible and fully disclosed purchaser, and must submit an exact copy of the offer to us. You also agree to provide us with any other information we need to evaluate the offer, if we request it within five (5) days of receipt of the offer. We have the right, exercisable by delivering written notice to the transferor within fifteen (15) days from the date of last delivery to us of the offer and any other documents we have requested, to purchase the Interest for the price and on the terms and conditions contained in the offer, except that we may substitute cash for any form of payment proposed in the offer, and will not be obligated to pay any \"finder's\" or broker's fees that are a part of the proposed Transfer. We also will not be required to pay any amount for any claimed value of intangible benefits, for example, possible tax benefits that may result by structuring and/or closing the proposed Transfer in a particular manner or for any consideration payable other than the bona fide purchase price for the Interest proposed to be transferred. (In fact, we may in our sole and absolute discretion withhold consent to any proposed Transfer if the offer directly or indirectly requires payment of any consideration other than the bona fide purchase price for the Interest proposed to be transferred.) Our credit will be deemed equal to the credit of any other proposed purchaser, and we will have at least sixty (60) days to prepare for closing. We will be entitled to all customary representations and warranties given purchasers in connection with such sales. If the proposed Transfer includes assets not related to the operation of the Franchise, we may purchase only the assets related to the operation of the Franchise or may also purchase the other assets. (An equitable purchase price will be allocated to each asset included in the Transfer.)   If we do not exercise our right of first refusal, the transferor may complete the sale to the Proposed New Owner pursuant to and on the terms of the offer, as long as we have approved the Transfer as provided in this Section 14. You must immediately notify us of any changes in the terms of an offer. Any material change in the terms of an offer before closing will make it a new offer, revoking any previous approval or previously made election to purchase and giving us a new right of first refusal effective as of the day we receive formal notice of a material change in the terms. If the sale to the Proposed New Owner is not completed within one hundred twenty (120) days after we have approved the Transfer, our approval of the proposed Transfer will expire. Any later proposal to complete that proposed Transfer will be deemed a new offer, giving us a new right of approval and right of first refusal effective as of the day we receive formal notice of the new (or continuing) proposal. We will not exercise a right of first refusal with respect to a proposed Transfer of less than a controlling interest to a member of a Principal Owner's immediate family or to your key employees.   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  14.7 Death and Disability.   Upon the death or permanent disability of you or a Principal Owner, the executor, administrator, conservator or other personal representative of the deceased or disabled person must Transfer the deceased or disabled person's Interest within a reasonable time, not to exceed forty-five (45) days from the date of death or permanent disability, to a person we have approved. Such Transfers, including without limitation transfers by a will or inheritance, will be subject to all the terms and conditions for assignments and Transfers contained in this Agreement. Failure to so dispose of an Interest within the forty-five (45) day period of time will constitute grounds for termination of this Agreement.   14.8 Effect of Consent to Transfer.   Our consent to a proposed Transfer pursuant to this Section 14 will not constitute a waiver of any claims we may have against you or any Principal Owner, nor will it be deemed a waiver of our right to demand exact compliance with any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement by the Proposed New Owner.   14.9 Consent Not Unreasonably Delayed.   If all the conditions are met to transfer the FA or any interest therein, we will not unreasonably delay granting our consent to the transfer.   15. TERMINATION OF THE FRANCHISE.   We have the right to terminate this Agreement effective upon delivery of notice of termination to you, if: (1) you do not develop or open the Franchise as provided in this Agreement; (2) you abandon, surrender, transfer control of, lose the right to occupy the Premises of, or do not actively operate, the Franchise, or your lease for or purchase of the location of the Franchise is terminated for any reason; (3) you or your Principal Owners assign or Transfer this Agreement, any Interest, the Franchise, or assets of the Franchise without complying with the provisions of Section 14; (4) you are adjudged a bankrupt, become insolvent or make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; (5) you use, sell, distribute or give away any unauthorized services or products, and do not cease the use, sale, or distribution of unauthorized services or products within ten (10) days after written notice is given to you; (6) you fail to maintain a valid license to practice and/or fail to maintain compliance with state and federal regulations and do not cure the failure within twenty (20) days after written notice is given to you; (7) you or any of your Principal Owners are convicted of or plead no contest to a felony or are convicted or plead no contest to any crime or offense that is likely to adversely affect the reputation of the Company, the Franchise, and/or the goodwill associated with the Marks; (8) you are involved in any action that is likely to adversely affect the reputation of the Company, the Franchise, and/or the goodwill associated with the Marks; (9) you or any of your employees violate any health or safety law, ordinance or regulation, or operate the Franchise in a manner that presents a health or safety hazard to your customers or the public; (10) you do not pay when due any monies owed to us or our affiliates, and do not make such payment within ten (10) days after written notice is given to you; (11) you fail to meet the minimum local advertising expenditures required in Section 11.2, and to provide the required proof of your expenditures; (12) you or any of your Principal Owners fail to comply with any other provision of this Agreement or any mandatory specification, standard, or operating procedure or you fail to make changes required to comply with applicable state or federal laws within twenty (20) days after written notice of such failure to comply is given to you; (13) you fail to procure or maintain any and all insurance coverage that we require, or otherwise fail to name us as an additional insured on any such insurance policies and failure to do so within ten (10) days after written notice is given to you; or (13) you or any of your Principal Owners fail on three (3) or more separate occasions within any twelve (12) consecutive month period to submit when due any financial statements, reports or other data, information, or supporting records; pay when due any amounts due under this Agreement; or otherwise fail to comply with this Agreement, whether or not such failures to comply are corrected after notice is given to you or your Principal Owners.   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  In addition, if, in the opinion of our legal counsel, any provision of this Agreement is contrary to law, then you and we agree to negotiate in good faith an amendment that would make this Agreement conform to the applicable legal requirements. If you and we are unable to reach such an agreement, or if fundamental changes to this Agreement are required to make it conform to the legal requirements, then we reserve the right to terminate this Agreement upon notice to you, in which case all of the post-termination obligations set forth in Section 16 shall apply.   In the event that we terminate this Agreement under this Section or other applicable provisions of this Agreement, we shall be entitled, in those states in which such termination fees are enforceable, to receive from you a termination fee in the amount equal to one-half (1/2) of our then- current initial franchise fee for new The Joint Corp. Location franchises (the \"Termination Fee\"). The Termination Fee shall be payable by you in addition to any damages payable to us, including loss of future revenues, resulting from your improper or wrongful breach or other termination of this Agreement. We shall be entitled to recover all costs, including attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with the termination and collection of the Termination Fee.   If you continue to operate the Franchise after termination of this Agreement, in addition to any other right or remedy we may have (including the Termination Fee), you agree to pay to us the amount of One Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($1,000.00) per day that you operate the Franchise in violation of this Agreement, plus all costs and attorneys' fees incurred as a result of the violation. This amount is set at $1,000 per day because it is a reasonable estimation of the damages that would occur from such a breach, and it will almost certainly be impossible to calculate precisely the actual damages from such a breach.   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  16. RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF COMPANY AND FRANCHISE OWNER UPON TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION OF THE FRANCHISE.   16.1 Payment of Amounts Owed to Company.   You agree to pay us within five (5) days after the effective date of termination or expiration of the Franchise, or any later date that the amounts due to us are determined, all amounts owed to us or our affiliates which are then unpaid.   16.2 Marks.   You agree that after the termination or expiration of the Franchise you will:   (a)  not directly or indirectly at any time identify any business with which you are associated as a current or former The Joint Corp. franchise or franchisee;   (b) not use any Mark or any colorable imitation of any Mark in any manner or for any purpose, or use for any purpose any trademark or other commercial symbol that suggests or indicates an association with us;   (c) return to us or destroy (whichever we specify) all customer lists, forms and materials containing any Mark or otherwise relating to a The Joint Corp. franchise;   (d) remove all Marks affixed to uniforms or, at our direction, cease to use those uniforms; and   (e) take any action that may be required to cancel all fictitious or assumed name or equivalent registrations relating to your use of any Mark.   16.3 De-Identification.   If you retain possession of the Premises, you agree to completely remove or modify, at your sole expense, any part of the interior and exterior decor that we deem necessary to disassociate the Premises with the image of a The Joint Corp. franchise, including any signage bearing the Marks. If you do not take the actions we request within thirty (30) days after notice from us, we have the right to enter the Premises and make the required changes at your expense, and you agree to reimburse us for those expenses on demand.   16.4 Confidential Information.   You agree that on termination or expiration of the Franchise you will immediately cease to use any of the Confidential Information, and agree not to use it in any business or for any other purpose. You further agree to immediately return to us all copies of the Operations Manual and any written Confidential Information or other confidential materials that we have loaned or provided to you. Upon   THE JOINT\u2026THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u2122 FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  16.5 Joint Software.   You agree that on termination or expiration of the Franchise, you will immediately cease to use the Joint Software and will uninstall it from all computer systems owned by the Franchise.   16.6 Company's Option to Purchase the Franchise.   Upon the termination or expiration of the Franchise, we will have the option, but not the obligation, exercisable for thirty (30) days upon written notice to you, to purchase at fair market value all of the assets of the Franchise, including all approved equipment, fixtures, furniture and signs and all supplies, materials, and other items imprinted with any Mark, and to take an assignment of the lease for the Premises and any other lease or concession agreement necessary for the operation of the Franchise. If you and we cannot agree on the fair market value of the assets of the Franchise within a reasonable time, such value shall be determined by an average of the appraisals of two (2) independent appraisers, one of whom will be selected by you and one of whom will be selected by us. If the appraisals differ by more than ten percent (10%), then you and we will mutually agree on a value, or if you and we cannot agree, our appraisers will select a third appraiser whose determination of market value will be final. We shall not assume any liabilities, debts or obligations of the Franchise in connection with any such transfer, and you will indemnify us from any and all claims made against us arising out of any such transfer of the assets of the Franchise. All parties will comply with all applicable laws in connection with any such transfer, and you agree to cooperate with us in complying with all such requirements.   The closing shall occur within thirty (30) days after we exercise our option to purchase the assets or such later date as may be necessary to comply with applicable bulk sales or similar laws. At the closing, you and we both agree to execute and deliver all documents necessary to vest title in the purchased assets and/or real property in us free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, except those assumed by us and/or to effectuate the lease of the Franchise Premises. You also agree to provide us with all information necessary to close the transaction. We reserve the right to assign our option to purchase the Franchise or designate a substitute purchaser for the Franchise.

You agree to be bound by the modification to the greatest extent lawfully permitted.   17.2 Unilateral Waiver of Obligations.

If at any time we do not exercise a right or power available to us under this Agreement or do not insist on your strict compliance with the terms of the Agreement, or if there develops a custom or practice that is at variance with the terms of this Agreement, then we will not be deemed to have waived our right to demand exact compliance with any of the terms of this Agreement at a later time. Similarly, our waiver of any particular breach or series of breaches under this Agreement, or of any similar term in any other agreement between us and any other The Joint Corp. franchisee will not affect our rights with respect to any later breach. It will also not be deemed to be a waiver of any breach of this Agreement for us to accept payments that are due to us under this Agreement.   17.7 Cumulative Remedies.

You and we irrevocably waive trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim, whether at law or in equity, brought by either you or us.

You agree that we may institute any action against you arising out of or relating to this Agreement (which is not required to be arbitrated hereunder or as to which arbitration is waived) in any state or federal court of general jurisdiction in Maricopa County, Arizona, and you irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of such courts and waive any objection you may have to either the jurisdiction or venue of such court.   17.12 Binding Effect.   This Agreement is binding on and will inure to the benefit of our successors and assigns and, subject to the Transfers provisions contained in this Agreement, will be binding on and inure to the benefit of your successors and assigns, and if you are an individual, on and to your heirs, executors, and administrators.   17.13 No Liability to Others; No Other Beneficiaries.   We will not, because of this Agreement or by virtue of any approvals, advice or services provided to you, be liable to any person or legal entity that is not a party to this Agreement, and no other party shall have any rights because of this Agreement.   17.14 Construction.

All references in this Agreement to masculine, neuter or singular usage will be construed to include the masculine, feminine, neuter or plural, wherever applicable. Except where this Agreement expressly obligates us to reasonably approve or not unreasonably withhold our approval of any of your actions or requests, we have the absolute right to refuse any request by you or to withhold our approval of any action or omission by you. The term \"affiliate\" as used in this Agreement is applicable to any company directly or indirectly owned or controlled by you or your Principal Owners, or any company directly or indirectly owned or controlled by us that sells products or otherwise transacts business with you.

In other words, the parties agree that each provision of this Agreement will be construed as independent of any other provision of this Agreement.   18. NOTICES AND PAYMENTS.

RECITALS   WHEREAS, the Parties hereto have entered into a certain Lease Agreement, dated on the ______ day of _______________, 20___ (the \"Agreement\"), and pertaining to the premises located at _____________________________ (the \"Premises\");   WHEREAS, Lessor acknowledges that Lessee intends to operate The Joint franchise from the Premises pursuant to a Franchise Agreement (the \"Franchise Agreement\") with The Joint Corp. (\"Franchisor\") under the name The Joint or other name designated by Franchisor (\"Franchised Business\"); and   WHEREAS, the Parties now desire to amend the Lease Agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions contained herein.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements herein set forth and each act done and to be done pursuant hereto, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, do hereby represent, warrant, covenant and agree as follows:   1. Remodeling and Decor. The above recitals are hereby incorporated by reference.

Assignment. Lessee shall have the right to assign all of its right, title and interest in and to the Lease Agreement to Franchisor or its parent, subsidiary, or affiliate, (including another franchisee) at any time during the term of the Lease, including any extensions or renewals thereof, without first obtaining Lessor's consent, pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Assignment of Lease attached hereto as Exhibit A.

Upon notice from Franchisor to Lessor requesting an automatic assignment, Lessor will, at the cost of Franchisor, take appropriate actions to secure the leased premises including but not limited changing the locks and granting Franchisor sole rights to the Premises.   (b)  Upon the expiration or termination of either the Lease Agreement or the Franchise Agreement (attached), Lessor will cooperate with and assist Franchisor in securing possession of the Premises and if Franchisor does not elect to take an assignment of the Lessee's interest, Lessor will allow Franchisor to enter the Premises, without being guilty of trespass and without incurring any liability to Lessor, to remove all signs, awnings, and all other items identifying the Premises as a Franchised Business and to make other modifications (such as repainting) as are reasonably necessary to protect The Joint marks and system, and to distinguish the Premises from a Franchised Business. In the event Franchisor exercises its option to purchase assets of Lessee or has rights to those through the terms and conditions any agreement between Lessee and Franchisor, Lessor shall permit Franchisor to remove all the assets being purchased by Franchisor.   5.

The amount payable pursuant to either of the prior two sentences (sometimes referred to as the \"Section 2(a) Amount\") shall be reduced by the sum of (A) 100% of any costs incurred by Nexstar during the applicable month in maintaining, replacing or purchasing capital equipment which is owned by WYZZ or which is used solely in connection with the operation of WYZZ-TV, which costs have not otherwise been deducted in calculating BCF, plus (B) 50% of the cost incurred by Nexstar during the applicable month in maintaining, replacing or purchasing capital equipment which is not owned by WYZZ and which is used in connection with the combined operation of both Stations (\"Combined Capital Equipment)\", which costs have not otherwise been deducted in calculating BCF. The Minimum BCF shall be Three Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars ($3,700,000) for calendar year 2002 and shall be increased on January 1, 2003 and on each January 1 thereafter in an amount equal to the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Philadelphia Regional Office - All Urban Consumers for the United States - All Items) (the \"PI\") over the prior year. During the Term, Nexstar shall calculate BCF (the \"BCF Report\") for each calendar month. The last day of each calendar month is referred to herein as an \"End Date\". During the Term, Nexstar shall, within thirty (30) days of each End Date deliver to WYZZ-TV the BCF Report for the month ending on such End Date. Within ninety (90) days following each\n\n                                       3\n\ncalendar year during the Term, Nexstar shall notify WYZZ of the BCF for such year (the \"Final BCF Report\") and, subject to clause (h) of this Section 2, within thirty (30) days after such notification either Nexstar shall make a payment to WYZZ or WYZZ shall make a payment to Nexstar, as appropriate to \"true-up\" the payments made hereunder based on (i) the final determination of the BCF for the entire year, and (ii) the principle that the aggregate Section 2(a) Amount for the calendar year should be equal to (x) thirty-five percent (35%) of BCF for such calendar year up to the Minimum BCF for such year, plus (y) fifty percent (50%) of BCF for such calendar year in excess of the Minimum BCF for such year, minus (z) the sum of one hundred percent (100%) of any costs incurred by Nexstar during such calendar year in maintaining, replacing or purchasing capital equipment which is owned by WYZZ or which is used solely in connection with the operation of WYZZ-TV, and fifty percent (50%) of any costs incurred by Nexstar during such calendar year in maintaining, replacing or purchasing capital equipment which is not owned by WYZZ and which is used in connection with the combined operation of both Stations (in each case to the extent such costs were not otherwise deducted in the calculation of BCF). Furthermore, for the purposes of clarification, to the extent the Section 2(a) Amount for the calendar year is less than zero, the \"true-up\" shall be done such that WYZZ shall have paid to Nexstar the amount by which the Section 2(a) Amount is less than zero. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein for purposes of the period commencing December 1, 2001 and ending December 31, 2001, the Minimum BCF shall be One Dollar ($1.00).\n\n            (b) In addition to the payment of the Section 2(a) Amount, Nexstar agrees to pay WYZZ, within 30 days following each calendar month of the Term, the amount set forth on Exhibit B hereto with respect to such calendar month\n\n            (c) On or before the 5th day of each calendar month during the Term, Nexstar shall pay to WYZZ the fair market value rent (as set forth on Exhibit C hereto) of any real property owned by WYZZ (or any affiliate thereof) and used by the Stations; provided, no rent shall be due to WYZZ, Nexstar or any affiliate thereof with respect to any period where the Stations are using corresponding real property owned by Nexstar (or any affiliate thereof). By way of example, no rent shall be due to WYZZ or Nexstar under this clause (c) for use by one of the Stations of a broadcast tower owned by WYZZ if the other Station is using a tower owned by Nexstar.\n\n            (d) For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"BCF\" is defined as Net\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome of the Stations, determined on a basis in accordance with GAAP, plus the sum of (X) (in each case to the extent deducted in calculating Net Income) (i) depreciation expense (ii) amortization expense (including amortization of program assets and amortization of deferred and stock based compensation) (iii) interest expense (iv) corporate overhead or management fees (v) income tax expense (vi) non-cash losses or expenses (including losses on disposals of assets and trade/barter expenses) (vii) Section 2(a) Amount expenses pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof (viii) any expenses (other than\n\n                                       4\n\nelectric costs relating to the digital transmission of either Station's primary commercial broadcast signal) related to either Station's \"DTV Spectrum\" (ix) costs or expenses arising from any claims relating to the period prior to the Effective Date, and (x) any expenses or costs identified on Exhibit D hereto less the sum of (Y) (i) cash payments for program contract rights relating to the Stations (ii) payments made by Nexstar to WYZZ pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 2, to the extent not otherwise taken into account in calculating Net Income, (iii) the aggregate fair market value rent (as set forth on Exhibit C hereto) of any real property owned by either Nexstar or WYZZ (or any affiliate of either) and used by the Stations to the extent the Stations are not using corresponding real property owned by each of the parties hereto (or any affiliate thereof) and which is not otherwise taken into account in calculating Net Income, (iv) any other rental income earned by either WYZZ or Nexstar from real property owned or leased thereby to the extent included in calculating Net Income (v) interest income to the extent included in calculating Net Income (vi) any rent paid with respect to any capital leases of the Stations (vii ) any revenues related to either Station's \"DTV Spectrum\" and (viii) any non-cash gains or revenues (including gains on disposals of assets and trade/barter revenue).\n\n            (e) At all times during the Term and for six (6) months following the termination of this Agreement, WYZZ shall have the right, upon prior written request to Nexstar, to review all of the books and records of Nexstar relating to the BCF Report and the Distributions. Any such review must take place during normal business hours between Monday through Friday.\n\n            (f) The parties agree that, to the extent permitted by law and by the rules, regulations and policies of the FCC, the Stations shall be operated in a manner consistent with industry standards for commercial broadcast television stations providing general entertainment programming and with a view toward maximizing the combined broadcast cash flow of the Stations.\n\n            (g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if, with respect to any month, the Section 2(a) Amount is a negative amount, then WYZZ shall pay such negative amount to Nexstar within seventy-five (75) days following the end of such month (and Nexstar shall make no payment of a Section 2(a) Amount to WYZZ with respect to such month); provided, with respect to each of the first three (3) months of the Term, the amount if any, payable pursuant to this clause (g) shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of accounts receivable retained by Buyer during such month pursuant to the first proviso to the last sentence of Section 10(d)(i).\n\n            (h) On or prior to the 30th day after WYZZ's receipt of the Final BCF Report, WYZZ may give Nexstar a written notice (an \"Objection Notice\") indicating its objections to the Final BCF Report. If WYZZ does not give Nexstar an Objection Notice within such 30-day period, then the Final BCF Report will be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto. If WYZZ gives a timely Objection Notice, then Nexstar and\n\n                                       5\n\nWYZZ will negotiate in good faith to resolve their disputes regarding the Final BCF Report. If Nexstar and WYZZ are unable to resolve all disputes regarding the Final BCF Report on or prior to the 30th day after the Objection Notice is given, then Nexstar and WYZZ will retain a \"big five\" accounting firm (either by mutual agreement or by random choice after eliminating any such firm which is conflicted or otherwise unable to participate) (the \"Independent Accounting Firm\") to resolve the dispute as soon as practicable, and in any event within thirty (30) days. The BCF for the applicable year as determined by the Independent Accounting Firm will be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto and will constitute the BCF for such year for all purposes of this Section 2; provided, the parties will use reasonable efforts to limit the scope of the Independent Accounting Firm's review. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm in connection with its review of the Final BCF Report shall be paid one-half by Nexstar and one-half by WYZZ.\n\n            (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, cash payments for program content rights relating to the Stations which were contractually due prior to the Effective Date shall for all purposes be treated as relating to the period following the Effective Date if, and only if, such payments were ninety days or less past due as of the Effective Date.\n\n      3. Material Considerations. Except to the extent inconsistent with law or the rules and regulations of any governmental agency, during the Term, each of the following considerations and undertakings (the \"Material Considerations\") by Nexstar shall require the prior consent of, and prior consultation with, WYZZ:\n\n            a. the setting of annual budgets (the \"Annual Budgets\") for the operation of the Stations (as more specifically addressed in Section 11 hereof);\n\n\n\n\n\n            b. determining the necessity for, and amount of, any single capital expenditure for either of the Stations to the extent not provided for in the applicable Annual Budget; provided, WYZZ's consent shall not be required for Nexstar to make unbudgeted capital expenditures in any calendar year which is necessary to maintain or restore the normal operations and transmission of the Station and which in the aggregate are not in excess of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000)\n\n            c. the hiring and firing of key employees of the Stations, consisting of general sales managers, national sales managers, and local sales managers (collectively, the \"Key Employees\"); provided, WYZZ's consent shall not be required for Nexstar to fire any Key Employee if circumstances exist which would give WYZZ the right to withhold its consent to the retention of such Key Employee under clause (e) of this Section 3; provided further, WYZZ must be reasonable in determining whether or not to consent to the hiring of any Key Employee to replace a former Key Employee who was not retained\n\n                                       6\n\nas a result of WYZZ's failure to consent to the retention of such former Key Employee pursuant to clause (e) of this Section 3;\n\n            d. the retention of any outside consultants not provided for in the applicable Annual Budget;\n\n            e. the retention of any Key Employee if (i) the combined share of market revenue (excluding political) for both Stations in any fiscal quarter (the \"First Quarter\") is ten percent (10%) or more below the combined share of market revenue (excluding political) for both Stations in the immediately preceding fiscal quarter (the \"Baseline Quarter\") and (ii) the combined share of market revenue (excluding political) for both Stations in either (x) the fiscal quarter immediately succeeding the First Quarter or (y) each of any two or more fiscal quarters out of the five fiscal quarters immediately succeeding the First Quarter, is ten percent (10%) or more below the combined share of market revenue for both Stations in the Baseline Quarter; provided, that Nexstar shall only be required to obtain a consent with respect to a Key Employee who WYZZ has requested be terminated); and; provided further, that WYZZ shall not be permitted to exercise its rights under this clause (e) more than once in any eighteen (18) month period with respect to any particular Key Employee position;\n\n            f. any material alteration or modification in or to the broadcast signal or the transmission of either of the Stations.\n\n                                       7\n\n      4.

Within twenty (20) days following the end of each full calendar month during the Collection Period, Nexstar shall furnish WYZZ with a report of all amounts collected, together with its check for payment thereof, with respect to the Accounts Receivable during such month; provided, that Nexstar shall be entitled to retain the first Three Hundred Ten Thousand Dollars ($310,000) (the \"Working Capital Amount\") of amounts collected on the Accounts Receivable for the purpose of funding WYZZ-TV's share of the initial working capital needs of the Stations; provided further,\n\n                                       14\n\nthat not later than the ninetieth (90th) day following the Effective Date, Nexstar shall pay to WYZZ the excess of the aggregate amount retained pursuant to the immediately preceding proviso over the aggregate reduction in payments otherwise due with respect to the first three months of the Term from WYZZ as a result of the proviso to Section 2(g) hereof.\n\n            (ii) Any payments received by Nexstar during the Collection Period from any Person that is an account debtor with respect to any account disclosed in the list of Accounts Receivable delivered by WYZZ to Nexstar shall be applied (A) first against the invoice, if any, as specified by the account debtor and (B) second against an account disclosed in such list, unless and to the extent that the account is disputed by the account debtor; provided, with respect to clause (B) above, payments on any accounts specified on WYZZ's list which relate to account debtors with respect to which Nexstar also has accounts, shall be applied first against the oldest accounts of WYZZ and Nexstar. Except to the extent resulting from Nexstar's willful breach of the terms of this Section 10(d), Nexstar shall incur no liability to WYZZ for any uncollected account. During the Collection Period, neither WYZZ nor any other agent of WYZZ shall make any direct solicitation without Nexstar's written consent of the account debtors for payment.\n\n      e. Proration. For purposes of this Agreement, revenues, expenses, and liabilities attributable to the Stations, including power and utilities charges, ad valorem property taxes, rents, income and sales taxes, and similar accruing, prepaid and deferred items, will be allocated in accordance with the principles that, as applicable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, (A) Nexstar and WYZZ will be allocated revenues earned or accrued, and expenses, costs and liabilities incurred in or allocable, with respect to the business and operation of the such entity's Station through but not including the Effective Date and following the last day of the Term, and (B) revenues earned or accrued, and expenses, costs and liabilities incurred in or allocable, with respect to the business and operation of the Stations on and after the Effective Date through the last day of the Term shall be allocated to the operation of the Stations under this Agreement and the calculation of BCF; provided, film costs relating to the period prior to the Effective Date shall be allocated to the period after the Effective Date to the extent such obligations were less than 90 days past due as of the Effective Date.\n\n      f. Payment of Liabilities and Obligations. Except to the extent provided to the contrary herein, as of the Effective Date and during the Term Nexstar shall undertake to pay, discharge and perform on WYZZ's behalf all obligations and liabilities of WYZZ under the WYZZ Contracts to the extent that the obligations and liabilities relate to the time after the Effective Date with respect to WYZZ-TV, as well as WYZZ's obligation to any Transferred Employees for vacation time. Nexstar shall not be required to pay, discharge or perform any other obligations or liabilities of WYZZ including (i) any obligations or liabilities under the WYZZ Contracts relating to the period prior to the Effective Date for WYZZ-TV, (ii) any claims (whether asserted or not) or pending\n\n                                       15\n\nlitigation or proceedings relating to the operation of WYZZ-TV prior to the Effective Date, (iii) any obligations or liabilities of WYZZ under any management incentive, employee pension, retirement, or other benefit plans, (iv) any obligations or liabilities of WYZZ under any collective bargaining agreements, (v) any obligation to any employee of WYZZ-TV for severance benefits or sick leave accrued prior to the Effective Date, (vi) any credit agreements, note purchase agreements, indentures, capital leases, or other financing arrangements, (vii) any agreements entered into other than in the ordinary course of business of WYZZ-TV, or (viii) any obligations or liabilities caused by, arising out of, or resulting from any action or omission of WYZZ prior to the Closing, and all such obligations and liabilities shall continue to be paid, discharged and performed by WYZZ. Notwithstanding anything herein to the\n\n\n\n\n\ncontrary, Nexstar shall be responsible pursuant to its reimbursement obligation hereunder for all film payments for programming which airs on WYZZ-TV to the extent such payments are not more than 90 days past due as of the Effective Date.\n\n      g. Consultation on Material Contractual Obligations. In addition to the other restrictions contained herein, Nexstar shall not enter into any material contractual obligation with respect to WYZZ-TV without first consulting with WYZZ to determine whether or not WYZZ (or its affiliates) is able to obtain more favorable terms with respect to the subject matter of such contract.\n\n      11. Mutual Covenants.\n\n      a. Budget.\n\n            (i) Not later than November 30 of each calendar year during the Term of this Agreement, WYZZ and Nexstar shall agree upon (1) an Operating Budget for the Stations (each an \"Annual Operating Budget\") setting forth in reasonable detail the reasonable and necessary costs and expenses that Nexstar is expected to incur in performing its obligations hereunder during the upcoming calendar year, including, without limitation, the costs of all Nexstar personnel (including salaries, incentives, commissions, bonuses, benefits, and payroll services), property, equipment (including repairs and maintenance, office space, office space modifications, utilities, sales, marketing costs, and related costs, and (2) a revenue budget for the Stations (the \"Annual Revenue Budget\" and, together with the Annual Operating Budget, the \"Annual Budget\") setting forth the projected sales revenues with respect to advertisements for the upcoming calendar year, as well as the assumptions underlying those projections; provided, in no event shall Nexstar have any right to object to the inclusion in the Annual Operating Budget of the cost of any programming which WYZZ determines is to be broadcast on WYZZ-TV, and in no event shall WYZZ have any right to object to the inclusion in the Annual Operating Budget of any programming which Nexstar determines is to be broadcast on WMBD-TV. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a part of the above-referenced budget approval process shall be the inclusion of proposed\n\n                                       16\n\ncommissions or other incentive plans applicable to the sale of advertisements, which plans shall be subject to each Party's approval, as part of their approval of the Annual Operating Budget. The Annual Budget for the one month period beginning December 1, 2001 and Year 2002_ (the \"Initial Budget\"), is attached hereto as Exhibit H.\n\n            (ii) For each year during the Term of this Agreement, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith and use their respective reasonable efforts to agree upon such changes, if any, to the Annual Budget for such year as are reasonably required to accurately reflect actual revenues generated and actual costs incurred during the six (6) month period ending June 30th. Each such revised Annual Budget, if required, shall be completed no later than October 31, of each year during the Term hereof.\n\n            (iii) In the event that the Parties are unable to resolve any disputes regarding any Annual Budget by December 15 of each year during the Term hereof, and either Party has notified the other in writing of the basis for its inability to agree on such Annual Budgets, then, subject to the proviso to the first sentence of clause (i) of this Section 11(a), the disputed items in the Annual Budget for the next succeeding year shall be the same as such disputed items were in the Annual Budget for the immediately preceding year, except for costs (e.g., sales commissions) that vary as a result of revenue.\n\n      b. Employees. Exhibit I contains a preliminary list of all employees, by position held by each, who are to be terminated from each of the Stations on such date as is mutually agreed by the parties on or after the Effective Time, but not later than March 1, 2002 (the \"Terminated Employees\"). All severance liabilities and all COBRA liabilities for any Terminated Employee terminated on or after the Effective Date shall be prorated between the Parties, in accordance with Section 4 hereof and Exhibit D hereto.\n\n      c. Confidentiality. Each of the parties shall during and after the Term continue to be bound by the provisions of the Confidentiality Letter Agreement dated as of July 31, 2001.\n\n      12. Transmitter Changes. In the event that either of the Parties, at any time, intends to file an application with the FCC to change the transmitter location, antenna height, power, or to change the frequency or hours of operation of its respective Station, the Parties agree to give ten (10) days prior written notice to the other Party of such proposed filing.\n\n      13. Assignment. Except as otherwise provided by this Agreement or in the event that either Party sells or otherwise transfers its Station to another (in which case such Party shall be required to assign to the Buyer, and such Buyer shall be required to assume, this Agreement, in its entirety), neither Party hereto shall assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement to a third party without the express written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.\n\n                                       17\n\n      14. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nbetween the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all prior agreements, commitments, or any other understandings between WYZZ and the Nexstar with respect to such subject matter. No provision of this Agreement shall be changed or modified, nor shall this Agreement be discharged in whole or in part except by an agreement in writing signed by the Party against whom the change, modification, or discharge is claimed or sought to be enforced, nor shall any waiver of any of the conditions or provisions of this Agreement be effective and binding unless such waiver shall be in writing and signed by the Party against whom the waiver is asserted, and no waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any other provision.\n\n      15. Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts with the same effect as if the signatures to each such counterpart were upon the same instrument.\n\n      16. Notices. All notices required under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given to an addressee when mailed if mailed by prepaid, certified, first class United States mail to the address for notice of such addressee set forth below:\n\n            If to WYZZ:\n\n            Mr. David D.

Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Maryland, without regard to its choice of law rules.\n\n      18. No Partnership or Joint Venture. This Agreement is not intended to be and shall not be construed as a partnership or joint venture agreement between the Parties. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement with regard to the services to be provided by Nexstar to WYZZ-TV, no Party to this Agreement shall be authorized to act as agent of or otherwise represent any other Party to this Agreement.\n\n      19. Cooperation. The Parties shall use their best efforts in the performance and fulfillment of the terms and conditions of this Agreement in effectuating the intent of such Parties as expressed under this Agreement. From time to time, without further consideration, the Parties shall execute and deliver such other documents and take such other actions as either Party hereto reasonably may request to effectuate such intent.\n\n      20. Arbitration. The Parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve all claims, disputes, and other disagreements arising out of or related to this Agreement. In the event that a dispute between the Parties cannot be resolved within thirty (30) days of written notice from one Party to the other Party, such dispute shall, at the request of either Party, after providing written notice to the other Party, be determined and settled by arbitration in Baltimore, Maryland, in accordance with the Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1 et seq., and the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The notice of arbitration shall specifically describe the claims, disputes, or other matters in issue to be submitted to arbitration. The Parties shall jointly select a single arbitrator who shall have the authority to hold hearings and to render a decision in accordance with the\n\n\n\n\n\n                                       19\n\nArbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. If the Parties are unable to agree within ten (10) days, the arbitrator shall be selected by the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The written decision of the arbitrator so appointed shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties and enforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction. The expenses of the arbitration shall be borne by the non-prevailing Party to the arbitration, including, but not limited to, the reasonable cost of experts, evidence, and legal counsel. Whenever the action is required to be taken under this Agreement within a specified period of time and the taking of such action is materially affected by a matter submitted to arbitration, such period shall automatically be extended by the number of days, plus ten (10), that are taken for the determination of that matter by the arbitrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree to use their best reasonable efforts to minimize the costs and frequency or arbitration hereunder. In addition, both Parties agree to use their best efforts to cause a final decision to be rendered with respect to the matters submitted to arbitration within sixty (60) days after its submission.\n\n      21. Severability. It is the intent of the Parties that the transactions contemplated hereunder comply in all respects to applicable law, including, but not limited to, the Communications Act of 1934, and all applicable rules, regulations, and policies of the FCC. If any provision of this Agreement shall become void, illegal, or invalid because of a decision or other action by any governmental or judicial authority with jurisdiction thereof, the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect without such offending provision so long as such remainder substantially reflects in all material respects the original agreement of the Parties. In such event, the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement promptly on lawful substitute provisions in place of said offending provision to effectuate as nearly as possible their intent as expressed by this Agreement.\n\n      22. Digital Spectrum. The FCC has authorized an additional 6 MHz of spectrum for digital television service (\"DTV Spectrum\") to Nexstar for WMBD-TV and to WYZZ for WYZZ-TV. Except to the extent necessary to comply with law and the rules and regulations of the FCC with regard to the digital broadcast of the Stations' commercial broadcast schedules, each of the Parties shall retain all rights to utilize its DTV Spectrum in accordance with the rules and regulations of the FCC and shall bear all costs in connection with such use including, without limitation, any costs of equipment necessary for digital broadcasting.\n\n      23. Further Assurances. WYZZ and Nexstar shall use commercially reasonable efforts in the performance and fulfillment of the terms and conditions of this Agreement in effectuating the intent of such Parties as expressed under this Agreement. From time to time, without further consideration, WYZZ and Nexstar shall execute and deliver such other documents and take such other actions as either Party hereto reasonably may request to effectuate such intent.\n\n                                       20\n\n      24.

This Agreement may be terminated by Nexstar by written notice to WYZZ (i) any time upon six (6) months prior notice, (ii) on six (6) months prior notice following the sale of WYZZ-TV by WYZZ, and/or (iii) if Nexstar is not then in material default or breach hereof, and WYZZ is in material breach of its representations or its material obligations hereunder, and has failed to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of written notice from Nexstar; provided, no notice may be given pursuant to clause (i) of this section prior to the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Effective Date.\n\n      b. Termination by WYZZ.

Termination due to invalidity or material change. Unless terminated pursuant to another provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement will terminate upon the first to occur of any of the following:\n\n            (i) this Agreement is declared invalid or illegal in whole or substantial part by an order or decree of an administrative agency or court of competent jurisdiction and such order or decree has not been stayed or has become final and no longer subject to further administrative or judicial review;\n\n            (ii) there has been a material change in FCC rules or policies that would cause this Agreement to be in violation thereof, and such change is in effect and not the subject of an appeal or further administrative or judicial review; provided, that in such event the Parties shall first negotiate in good faith and attempt to agree on an amendment to this Agreement that will provide the Parties with a valid, binding and enforceable agreement that conforms to the new FCC rules, policies or precedent; or\n\n            (iii) the mutual, written consent of both Parties.\n\n      d. Nexstar's Additional Termination Rights. Notwithstanding anything\n\n\n\n\n\nherein to the contrary and in addition to Nexstar's termination rights in Section 24.a. above, Nexstar shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon the event that WYZZ makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, files or has filed against it a petition for bankruptcy, reorganization or an arrangement for the benefit of creditors, or\n\n                                       21\n\nfor the appointment of a receiver, trustee or similar creditor's representative for the property or assets of WYZZ under any federal or state insolvency law, which if filed against WYZZ, has not been dismissed within thirty (30) days thereof.\n\n      e. WYZZ's Additional Termination Rights. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary and in addition to WYZZ's termination rights in Section 24.b. above, WYZZ shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon the event that Nexstar makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, files or has filed against it a petition for bankruptcy, reorganization or an arrangement for the benefit of creditors, or for the appointment of a receiver, trustee or similar creditors' representative for the property or assets of Nexstar under any federal or state insolvency law, which if filed against Nexstar, has not been dismissed within thirty (30) days thereof.\n\n      f. WYZZ's Rights following Termination. (i) If this Agreement is terminated for any reason, WYZZ may continue to use Nexstar's facility (to the extent of, and consistent with, the use immediately prior to the termination) for a period of six (6) months following the date of actual termination, without regard to any continuation which occurs as a result of the immediately succeeding sentence (the \"Continuation Period\"). If the Parties elect to continue the Services during the Continuation Period, then the Nexstar shall continue to provide the Services and pay the Section 2(a) Amount in accordance with this Agreement during the Continuation Period. If the Parties, or any one of them, elect(s) to discontinue the provision of Services during the Continuation Period, the WYZZ shall pay to the Nexstar a commercially reasonable rent (on a monthly basis in advance) for the use and occupancy of, or any part of, the Nexstar's facilities. WYZZ shall make all payments due to Nexstar hereunder within ten (10) days following receipt of an invoice from Nexstar for the payment of such rent. (ii) Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement, any amounts due hereunder with respect to the period prior to the end of the Term shall be paid in accordance with the provisions hereof following the end of the Term.\n\n      g. WYZZ's Right to Hire Certain Employees. Upon final termination of this Agreement, WYZZ shall have the obligation to hire any employee of Nexstar solely providing services to WYZZ-TV, including (without limitation) all of the account executives of Nexstar exclusively selling time on WYZZ-TV. The parties shall negotiate in good faith with respect to any rights of WYZZ to hire any other employees of Nexstar who are providing services to both Stations. For a period of one year from the termination of this Agreement, neither Party hereto (or any of its affiliates) will directly or indirectly solicit to employ or employ any of the employees of the other Party hereto if such employees were employed by either of the Stations at any time during the six month period immediately preceding the termination of this Agreement.\n\n      h. Joint Capital Equipment. Upon the final termination of this&sbsp;Agreement, the parties shall negotiate in good faith regarding which party shall retain any Combined\n\n                                       22\n\nCapital Equipment purchased during the term hereof for use on both Stations, as well as any payment to be made by the retaining party to the other party after taking into account the allocation among the parties during the term hereof of the cost of acquiring and maintaining such Combined Capital Equipment, as well as the benefit of any depreciation deductions received by Nexstar with respect thereto.\n\n      25. Indemnification.\n\n      a. by Nexstar. Nexstar shall indemnify and hold harmless WYZZ from and against any and all claims, losses, costs, liabilities, damages, and expenses, including any FCC fines or forfeitures (including reasonable legal fees and other expenses incidental thereto), of every kind, nature and description (collectively \"Damages\") arising or resulting from or relating to (i) Nexstar's breach of any representation, covenant, agreement or other obligation of Nexstar contained in this Agreement and (ii) any action, which constitutes gross negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct taken by Nexstar or its employees and agents with respect to WYZZ-TV, or any failure by Nexstar or its employees and agents to take any action with respect to WYZZ-TV, including, without limitation, Damages relating to violations of the Act, or any rule, regulation or policy of the FCC, slander, defamation or other claims relating to the sale of advertising time on the Station (except where the Damages are caused by WYZZ's negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct, or breach of its representations or obligations under this Agreement), from and after the Effective Date of this Agreement.\n\n      b. by WYZZ. WYZZ shall indemnify and hold harmless Nexstar from and against any and all Damages arising or resulting from or relating to (i) WYZZ's breach of any representation, covenant, agreement or other obligation of WYZZ contained in this Agreement and (ii) any action taken, which constitutes gross\n\n\n\n\n\nnegligence, recklessness or willful misconduct by WYZZ or its employees and agents with respect to WMBD-TV, or any failure by WYZZ or its employees and agents to take any action with respect to WMBD-TV, including, without limitation, Damages relating to violations of the Act, or any rule, regulation or policy of the FCC, slander, defamation or other claims relating to programming provided by WYZZ or WYZZ's broadcast and sale of advertising time on WMBD-TV (except where the Damages were incurred by Nexstar's negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct, or breach of any representation, covenant, agreement or other obligation contained in this Agreement), from and after the Effective Date of this Agreement.\n\n      c. Indemnification Procedure. Neither WYZZ nor Nexstar shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section unless such claim for indemnification is asserted in a written notice delivered to the other Party, together with a statement as to the factual basis for the claim and the amount of the claim. Together with such notice or promptly following the delivery thereof, the Party making the claim (the \"Claimant\") shall make available to the other Party (the \"Indemnitor\") information relied upon by the\n\n                                       23\n\nClaimant to substantiate the claim. Such notice shall be given promptly following Claimant knowing or having reason to know about such claim; provided, the Indemnitor shall be relieved of a liability for Claimant's failure to provide notice only if, and to the extent, adversely impacted by such failure. The Indemnitor under this Section 26(c) shall have the right to conduct and control through counsel of its own choosing the defense of any third Party claim, action or suit (and the Claimant shall cooperate fully with the Indemnitor), but the Claimant may, at its election, participate in the defense of any such claim, action or suit at its sole cost and expense; provided, that, if the Indemnitor shall fail to defend any such claim, action or suit, then the Claimant may defend through counsel of its own choosing such claim, action or suit, and (so long as it gives the Indemnitor at least fifteen (15) days' notice of the terms of the proposed settlement thereof and permits the Indemnitor to then undertake the defense thereof), Claimant may settle such claim, action or suit, and, if Claimant is entitled to be indemnified by Indemnitor hereunder, Claimant may recover from the Indemnitor the amount of such settlement or of any judgment and the costs and expenses of such defense. The Indemnitor shall not compromise or settle any third Party claim, action or suit without the prior written consent of the Claimant, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.\n\n      26. Damages; Specific Performance.\n\n      a. In the event of a material breach by WYZZ of its obligations hereunder, Nexstar shall be entitled to seek monetary damages against WYZZ. The Parties recognize, however, that, given the unique nature of the Station and this Agreement, monetary damages alone will not be adequate to compensate Nexstar for any injury resulting from WYZZ's breach. Except to the extent such action would not be permitted by the rules and regulations of the FCC, Nexstar shall therefore be entitled, in addition to a right to seek and collect monetary damages, to obtain specific performance of the terms of this Agreement. If any action is brought by Nexstar to enforce this Agreement, WYZZ shall waive the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law. In addition, in the event of a material breach by WYZZ of its obligations hereunder, Nexstar shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement and exercise its rights pursuant to Section 25(b) hereof (except that Nexstar may not assert consequential, special or punitive damages or any claim for lost profits).\n\n      b. In the event of a material breach by Nexstar of its obligations hereunder, WYZZ shall be entitled to seek monetary damages against Nexstar. The Parties recognize, however, that, given the unique nature of the Station and this Agreement, monetary damages alone will not be adequate to compensate WYZZ for any injury resulting from Nexstar's breach. Except to the extent such action would not be permitted by the rules and regulations of the FCC, WYZZ shall therefore be entitled, in addition to a right to seek and collect monetary damages, to obtain specific performance of the terms of this Agreement. If any action is brought by WYZZ to enforce this Agreement, Nexstar\n\n                                       24\n\nshall waive the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law. In addition, in the event of a material breach by Nexstar of its obligations hereunder, WYZZ shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement and exercise its rights pursuant to Section 25(a) hereof (except that WYZZ may not assert consequential, special or punitive damages or any claim for lost profits).\n\n      c.

(the \"Investor\"), in favor of U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, a national banking association in its capacity as administrative agent (in such capacity and together with its successors and assigns in such capacity, the \"Agent\"), for itself and the lending institutions from time to time party to the Financing Agreement (defined below) (collectively and together with their respective successors and assigns, the \"Lenders\").\n\nRECITALS:\n\nA. The Agent, Lenders and SUNTRON CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation, K*TEC OPERATING CORP., a Delaware corporation, SUNTRON GCO, L.P., a Texas limited partnership, EFTC OPERATING CORP., a Delaware corporation, SUNTRON-IOWA, INC., a Delaware corporation, CURRENT ELECTRONICS, INC., an Oregon corporation, RM ELECTRONICS, INC., a New Hampshire corporation, and SUNTRON-KANSAS, INC., a Delaware corporation (collectively, the \"Borrowers\") entered into a certain Financing Agreement bearing event date herewith (as the same may be amended, modified, restated or supplemented from time to time, the \"Financing Agreement\").\n\nB. As a condition precedent to the effectiveness of the Financing Agreement, the Agent has required that the Investor execute and deliver this Agreement.\n\nD. The Investor is a shareholder of Suntron Corporation and, as such, expects to derive benefits from the Amendment and from the credit accommodations extended to the Borrowers pursuant to the Financing Agreement, and finds it in its best interests to execute and deliver this Agreement to the Agent.\n\nAGREEMENTS:\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises herein set forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the nature, receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:\n\n1. Defined Terms. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings given such terms in the Financing Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n\n\"Required Capital Contributions\" means some combination of (a) one or      more unrestricted cash contributions to the capital of one or more of the      Borrowers made by the Investor, and/or (b) one or more Qualified      Subordinated Loans made by the Investor to one or more of the Borrowers, in      each case as required under Section 2 below, in any or all cases, in an      aggregate amount not to exceed $5,000,000 during the term of this      Agreement.\n\n\"Qualified Subordinated Loan\" shall mean a loan or other financial      accommodation (excluding interest paid in kind) extended by any Person to      one or more of the Borrowers which is subordinated in right of payment and      security to the Obligations pursuant to the terms of a written      subordination agreement (substantially equivalent to the Subordination      Agreement bearing even date herewith executed by the Investor in favor of      the Agent), the proceeds of which loan or other financial accommodation      have been delivered to the applicable Borrower(s) in the form of cash or      cash equivalents.\n\n2. Contributions to Capital. The Investor agrees to make, and the applicable Borrower(s) agree(s) to accept, Required Capital Contributions in respect of the applicable 12 Month Period (or shorter period prior to July 3, 2006, as applicable) in an amount sufficient to cause (via an addition to Adjusted EBITDAR in the amount of such Required Capital Contributions) the Borrowers to comply with Section 2 of Schedule 10.28 to the Financing Agreement as of the last day of each Fiscal Quarter. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Agent acknowledges and agrees that the Investor's obligation to make Required Capital Contributions hereunder shall be limited to an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 during the term of this Agreement. The Agent further acknowledges and agrees that, regardless of whether other \"Events of Default\" (as defined therein) have occurred and are continuing under the Financing Agreement, in no event shall the Investor be obligated to make any Required Capital Contributions hereunder if the Borrowers have fully complied with Section 2 of Schedule 10.28 to the Financing Agreement as of the last day of the applicable Fiscal Quarter for the applicable 12 Month Period (or shorter period prior to July 3, 2006, as applicable).\n\n3. Timing of Required Capital Contributions. The Required Capital Contributions shall be made within forty-five (45) days following the last day of each Fiscal Quarter, unless the last day of such Fiscal Quarter is the same as the fiscal year end, and in such case, ninety (90) days following such fiscal year end.\n\n4. Specific Performance and Liquidated Damages. The Investor acknowledges and agrees that if a Maintenance Event of Default (as defined in Section 10 below) has occurred and is continuing hereunder, the Agent, for itself and on behalf of the Lenders, shall have the non-exclusive right to\n\n\n\n\n\nobtain specific performance of the obligation of the Investor to make the Required Capital Contributions. If specific performance is not a remedy then available to the Agent and the Lenders for any reason, the Agent and the Lenders will suffer damages in an amount which, due to the special nature of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, will be impracticable or extremely difficult to ascertain. Determination of such damages would necessitate determinations of value which would be based upon speculative determination of the value of assets of the Borrowers and the capacity of assets of the Borrowers to pay the Obligations and other Indebtedness of the Borrowers. Such damages are uncertain and incapable of estimation as of the date of this Agreement and shall remain so to the date of the occurrence of any Maintenance Event of Default hereunder. The Investor, the Agent and the Lenders hereby acknowledge and agree that (a) an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the full amount of each Required Capital Contribution that has not been made by the Investor and (ii) the then-outstanding balance of the Obligations, represents a reasonable estimate of the damages which the Agent and the Lenders will sustain upon the occurrence of an Maintenance Event of Default hereunder, and (b) such lesser amount will be the full, agreed and liquidated damages resulting from the occurrence of any Maintenance Event of Default hereunder. The payment of such amount is intended to constitute liquidated damages to the Agent and the Lenders and shall not be deemed to constitute a forfeiture or penalty. Upon receipt by the Agent, such amount may, in the sole discretion of the Agent, be applied to the Obligations when and as due; provided, however, that such amount, if so applied, may not be reborrowed by any Borrower under the Financing Agreement.\n\n5. Representations and Warranties. The Investor hereby represents and warrants as follows:\n\n(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement will not      result in any violation of, or be in conflict with or constitute a default      under, any agreement or under any law, statute, regulation or ordinance      applicable to the Investor or result in the creation of any Lien upon any      properties or assets of the Investor.\n\n2\n\n(b) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the      Investor, and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the      Investor, enforceable against the Investor in accordance with its&bbsp;terms.\n\n(c) No consent or authorization of, filing with or other act by or in      respect of, any governmental authority and no consent of any other Person      (including, without limitation, any creditor of the Investor) is required      in connection with the execution, delivery, performance, validity or      enforceability of this Agreement.\n\n6. Special Account. All Required Capital Contributions shall be made by Investor via wire transfer directly into the Special Account.\n\n7. Unconditional Obligations, Waivers of Defenses. The obligations of the Investor under this Agreement shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances, and shall not be to any extent or in any way discharged, impaired or otherwise affected except by performance in full. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such obligations shall not be affected by: (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of the Financing Agreement or any other Loan Document, (b) any amendment of or addition or supplement to, or any waiver or consent with respect to, the Financing Agreement or any other Loan Document, (c) any exercise or nonexercise of any right, power or remedy under or in respect of the Financing Agreement or any other Loan Document (d) any exchange, release or nonperfection of all or any portion of the Collateral, or any other action or omission to act with respect to all or any portion of the Collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any guaranty for all or any of the Obligations, or any other release, extension, settlement, compromise, indulgence or other action, inaction, change, waiver or omission under or in respect of the Financing Agreement or any other Loan Document, (e) the value of all or any portion of the Collateral regardless of the manner of determining such value, (f) the subordination of the payment of the Obligations or any part thereof to the payment of any other Indebtedness which may at the time be due or owing by the Borrowers (or any of them) to the Agent or the Lenders or to any other Person, (g) any insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization, readjustment, composition, dissolution or other similar proceeding involving any Borrower or the Investor, (h) any \"Event of Default\" (as defined therein) under the Financing Agreement whether or not the Obligations shall have become, or been declared, due and payable (i) any claim, abatement, reduction, limitation, impairment, termination, set-off, defense, counterclaim or recoupment whatsoever or any right to any of the foregoing (including, but not limited to, claims, abatements, reductions, limitations, impairments, terminations, set-offs, defenses, counterclaims or recoupment for or on account of any past, present or future Indebtedness of any Borrower to the Investor or which may be asserted by any Borrower against the Agent or the Lenders, whether or not arising under this Agreement and whether or not arising out of any action or nonaction on the part of such Borrower, the Agent or the Lenders, including any disposition of any assets of such Borrower, pursuant to requirements of any governmental authority, actions of judicial receivers or trustees or otherwise, and whether or not arising from willful or negligent acts or omissions), (j) any failure on the part of any Borrower to perform its duties and obligations under this Agreement, (k) any other circumstances which constitutes or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of the Borrowers (or any of them) for the Obligations, or of the Investor under this Agreement, in bankruptcy or in any other instance, (l) any action or thing which might, but for this provision of this Agreement, be deemed a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor, other than irrevocable making of the Required Capital\n\n\n\n\n\nContributions or the liquidated damage amount specified in this Agreement, or (m) any other circumstance, happening, condition or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; whether or not the Investor shall have notice or knowledge of any of the foregoing or shall have consented to any of the foregoing.\n\n3\n\n8. Waivers. The Investor hereby irrevocably waives, to the extent that it may do so under applicable law: (a) any defense based on the adequacy of a remedy at law which may be asserted as a bar to the remedy of specific performance in any action brought against the Investor for specific performance of this Agreement by Agent, for itself and on behalf of the Lenders, or for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders by a receiver or trustee appointed for any Borrower or in respect of all or a substantial part of any Borrower's assets under the bankruptcy or insolvency laws of any jurisdiction to which such Borrower is, or its assets are, subject, (b) all statutes of limitations as a defense to any action or proceeding brought against the Investor by the Agent, for itself and on behalf of the Lenders under this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law, (c) any right the Investor may have to require the Agent or the Lenders to proceed against the Borrowers (or any of them), proceed against or exhaust any security held from the Borrowers (or any of them), or pursue any other remedy in the Agent's or the Lenders' power to pursue, (d) any defense based on any claim that the Investor's obligations hereunder exceed or are more burdensome than those of the Borrowers under the Financing Agreement or the other Loan Documents (as defined in the Financing Agreement), (e) any defense based on (i) any legal disability of any Borrower, (ii) any release, discharge, modification, impairment or limitation of the liability of any Borrower to the Agent or the Lenders from any cause, whether consented to by the Agent and/or the Lenders or arising by operation of law or from any bankruptcy or other voluntary or involuntary proceeding, in or out of court, for the adjustment of debtor creditor relationships (\"Insolvency Proceeding\") and (iii) any rejection or disaffirmance of this Agreement or the obligations hereunder, or the Obligations, or any portion thereof, or any security held therefor, in any such Insolvency Proceeding; (f) any defense based on any action taken or omitted by the Agent or the Lenders in any Insolvency Proceeding involving any Borrower, including any election to have the Agent's claims allowed as being secured, partially secured or unsecured, any extension of credit by the Agent and the Lenders to the Borrowers (or any of them) in any Insolvency Proceeding, and the taking and holding by the Agent and the Lenders of any security for any such extension of credit, (g) all presentments, demands for performance, notices of nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Agreement and of the existence, creation, or incurring of new or additional indebtedness, and demands and notices of every kind, (h) any defense based on or arising out of any defense that the Borrowers (or any of them) may have to the payment or performance of the Obligations or any part of them; and (i) any defense based on or arising out of any action of the Agent or the Lenders under this Agreement, the Financing Agreement or any of the Loan Documents (as defined in the Financing Agreement).\n\n9. Non-Reliance on Agent or Lenders. The Investor hereby warrants and represents to the Agent and the Lenders that: (a) the Investor now has, and will continue to have, independent means of obtaining information concerning the affairs, financial condition and business of each Borrower, (b) the Investor is familiar with the financial condition of each Borrower and has independently evaluated such financial condition, (c) the Investor is not in any way relying on any representations made by the Agent or the Lenders as to any Borrower, the Obligations, the Loan Documents or any collateral security therefore or other guarantors or endorsers, co-singers or sureties thereof or any related matters, and (d) the Investor has had an opportunity to review the Financing Agreement, the Amendment and all of the other Loan Documents. Neither the Agent nor the Lenders shall have any duty or responsibility to provide the Investor with any credit or other information concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of any Borrower which may come into the Agent's or any Lender's possession.\n\n10. Events of Default; Remedies. Any one or more of the following events shall constitute a \"Maintenance Event of Default\" under this Agreement: (a) if the Investor shall fail to pay, when and as due, any Required Capital Contribution and such failure shall continue for five (5) days; (b) if the Investor shall fail to perform any other of the Investor's obligations in this Agreement, and such failure shall continue for fifteen (15) days, (c) if any warranty or statement made or information provided\n\n4\n\nby the Investor in connection with this Agreement is untrue or misleading in any material respect on the date made; (d) if Investor shall, at any time, fail to have committed capital in an aggregate minimum amount equal to $5,000,000 less the sum of all Required Capital Contributions (if any) actually made by the Investor during the term of this Agreement, as determined based on the most recent information made available by the Investor to the Agent pursuant to Section 20 below; or (e) the Investor shall become insolvent or generally fail to pay, or admit in writing its inability to pay, its debts as they mature or apply for or consent to the appointment of a trustee or other custodian for its properties, or make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or any bankruptcy, reorganization, debt arrangement or other proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency law, is instituted by or against the Investor. Upon the occurrence of any Maintenance Event of Default hereunder, the Agent, for itself and on behalf of the Lenders, may exercise any of its rights and remedies\n\n\n\n\n\navailable at law or in equity (including, without limitation, the rights and remedies described in Section 4 above). The Investor and the Borrowers each expressly acknowledge and agree that the occurrence of any Maintenance Event of Default hereunder shall constitute an \"Event of Default\" (as defined therein) under the Financing Agreement.\n\n11. Expenses. The Investor agrees to pay or reimburse (or cause the Borrowers to pay or reimburse) the Agent and the Lenders on demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including in each case all reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the Agent or the Lenders in connection with enforcement of this Agreement.\n\n12. Consideration and Reliance. The Investor acknowledges that the Agent and the Lenders have relied upon and will continue to rely hereafter upon the Investor's undertakings herein in making or maintaining the advances under the Financing Agreement. The Investor acknowledges that the making or maintenance of such advances by the Agent and the Lenders produces economic benefit to the Investor, and that the Investor will receive consideration as the result of the making or maintaining of such advances.\n\n13. Miscellaneous. This Agreement supersedes and merges into it all prior agreements and understandings between the Investor, the Agent and the Lenders, whether oral or written, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. No delay or failure by the Agent or the Lenders in the exercise of any right or remedy shall constitute a waiver thereof and no single or partial exercise by the Agent or the Lenders of any right or remedy shall preclude other or further exercise of any other right or remedy. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Investor and the Investor's successors, transferees and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Agent, for itself and on behalf of the Lenders, and its successors, transferees, and assigns. Any invalidity or unenforceability of any provision or application of this Agreement shall not affect other lawful provisions and applications hereof and to this end the provisions of this Agreement are declared to be severable.\n\n14. No Third Party Beneficiaries. The Investor, the Agent and the Lenders have agreed that there are no intended third party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and specifically, that the Borrowers and their respective affiliates, successors and assigns are not third party beneficiaries.\n\n15. GOVERNING LAW. THE VALIDITY, CONSTRUCTION AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO CONFLICT OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF.\n\n16. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. AT THE OPTION OF&sbsp;THE AGENT, FOR ITSELF AND ON BEHALF OF THE LENDERS, THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE ENFORCED IN ANY FEDERAL COURT OR MINNESOTA STATE COURT SITTING IN HENNEPIN COUNTY OR\n\n5\n\nRAMSEY COUNTY, MINNESOTA; AND THE INVESTOR, THE AGENT AND THE LENDERS CONSENT TO THE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF ANY SUCH COURT AND WAIVE ANY ARGUMENT THAT VENUE IN SUCH FORUMS IS NOT CONVENIENT. IN THE EVENT ANY BORROWER OR THE AGENT, FOR ITSELF AND ON BEHALF OF THE LENDERS, COMMENCES ANY ACTION IN ANOTHER JURISDICTION OR VENUE UNDER ANY TORT OR CONTRACT THEORY ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM THE RELATIONSHIP CREATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER PARTY AT ITS OPTION SHALL BE ENTITLED TO HAVE THE CASE TRANSFERRED TO ONE OF THE JURISDICTIONS AND VENUES ABOVE-DESCRIBED, OR IF SUCH TRANSFER CANNOT BE ACCOMPLISHED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, TO HAVE SUCH CASE DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\n\n17. WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY. EACH OF THE INVESTOR, THE AGENT AND THE LENDERS IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n18. Continuing Agreement; Reinstatement. This Agreement shall in all respects be a continuing agreement and, subject to Section 19 below, shall remain in full force and effect (notwithstanding, without limitation, the dissolution of the undersigned or that at any time or from time to time all of the Obligations may have been paid in full) until such time as (a) all of the Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations to the extent no unsatisfied claim giving rise thereto has been asserted) have been paid in full in cash, and (b) any commitment on the part of the Agent and the Lenders to extend further financial accommodations to the Borrowers (or any of them) has been terminated. This Agreement shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment, or any part thereof, on account of any of the Obligations is invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Agent or the Lenders upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization of any Borrower or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for any Borrower, or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.\n\n19. Release of Agreement. The Investor may, at any time after March 31, 2007, and not more than once during any fiscal quarter of the Borrowers, request that the Agent release this Agreement by providing the Agent with written notice of the same (each, a \"Release Request\"). If such a request is made, the Agent agrees to release this Agreement on or before the Release Date (defined below) provided that all of the following conditions have been satisfied:\n\n(a) Unaudited financial statements of the Borrowers required under      Section 8.5 of the Financing Agreement, for the period of four (4)\n\n\n\n\n\nconsecutive Fiscal Quarters ending on, or most recently ended prior to, the      date of such Release Request (or, if the Fiscal Quarter ending on or most      recently ended prior to the date of such Release Request is the last Fiscal      Quarter of any Fiscal Year of the Borrowers, the audited financial      statements for the Borrowers required under Section 8.7 of the Financing      Agreement the Fiscal Year ending on, or most recently ended prior to, the      date of such Release Request) have been received by the Agent, and based on      the information contained in such financial statements, the Adjusted Fixed      Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Financing Agreement) as of last      day of the Fiscal Quarter ending on or most recently ended prior to, the      date of such Release Request, for said period of four (4) consecutive      Fiscal Quarters, is no less than 1.25 to 1.0;\n\n(b) no \"Default\" or \"Event of Default\" (as those terms are defined in      the Financing Agreement) shall have occurred and be continuing as of the      date of such Release Request; and\n\n6\n\n(c) the Investor shall have provided the Agent, and shall have caused      the Borrowers to have provided the Agent, with such information as the      Agent may reasonably request to confirm that the conditions set forth in      subsections (a) and (b) above have been satisfied.\n\nFor purposes of this Section 19, the term \"Release Date\" shall mean the date which is five (5) days after the date on which the Agent has received all documentation and other information reasonably necessary to determine that all of the foregoing conditions have been satisfied and has confirmed such satisfaction to the Borrowers in writing.\n\n20. Evidence of Minimum Liquidity.

EFS, at its sole cost and expense, shall be solely responsible for (i) developing, designing,  operating, maintaining and distributing the Catalogs; (ii) developing, designing, operating, maintaining and hosting the Websites; (iii)  except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, the creation (except for that provided by Client) and use of all content to be  displayed in the Catalogs and on the Websites; and (iv) marketing and promotion of the Playboy Commerce Business.

EFS, at its sole cost and expense or (with respect to pass-through expenses such as  shipping, gift wrapping, etc.) at the consumer's expense, shall be solely responsible for conducting all business activities related to  the Playboy Commerce Business, including, but not limited to the following activities: (i) setting the price consumers will pay for  Merchandise offered through the Catalogs and Websites and for shipping thereof; (ii) processing all Catalog and Website orders  placed by consumers, including, but not limited to, all picking, packing, billing, shipping, gift wrapping and other value-added  services necessary to process orders from order placement to delivery, which shall be performed substantially as set forth in  Exhibit 3, attached hereto and hereby incorporated by reference (collectively, \"Fulfillment Services\"); (iii) providing pricing, billing  and financial clearinghouse services in connection with the Playboy Commerce Business; (iv) handling all customer service matters  (provided, however, that Client and EFS shall agree upon a \"hot transfer\" process whereby non-e-commerce-related customer  calls will be rerouted); (v) handling all financial transactions related to the Playboy Commerce Business, including, but not limited  to, establishing merchant accounts with a banking institution to be approved by Client; (vi) handling all aspects of procuring  Merchandise to be made available for sale through the Playboy Commerce Business, including, without limitation, all warehouse  and inventory maintenance and control; and (vii) except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, handling all advertising,  promotion and marketing relating to the Playboy Commerce Business. Client acknowledges that the efficient and cost effective  fulfillment of orders on the Websites will require that third parties that provide Merchandise to EFS under a Playboy license  adhere to certain shipping and packaging guidelines provided by EFS, and which comply with Client's packaging guidelines as set  forth in Exhibit 3. Client agrees to provide reasonable assistance to EFS to enable EFS to have such third parties agree to abide  by the EFS guidelines.    (c) Client Approval. All aspects of the Websites and the Catalogs, including, but not limited to, their \"look and  feel\" (including as set forth in Section 1.1(d)(iii) below), use of the Playboy Marks (as defined in Section 7.2), functionality,  models to be used and all Merchandise sold therein, shall be subject to Client's prior written approval, which shall not be  unreasonably withheld. Further, EFS acknowledges that Client reserves the right to change the names of the PlayboyStore and  ShopTheBunny/BunnyShop Catalog and Websites to new Client brands and/or to add names to be used provided that Client  provides EFS with no less than six (6) months prior written notice. In the event that names are changed, except to the extent that  there is an extenuating reason for such name change, EFS shall be permitted to continue to use domain names then in use for  purposes of Micro Sites and/or forwarding domains (i.e., driving traffic to the new names).    (d) Websites    (i) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties and provided that this Agreement is executed not later than  January 15, 2008, EFS agrees that no later than March 1, 2008, both Websites shall launch and be fully operational, with the  exception of the gift wrapping which EFS shall make available as set forth in the time and action calendar (attached hereto as  Exhibit 12 and hereby incorporated by reference) and local billing (pursuant to Section 3.1, below), and EFS shall be ready to  perform all aspects of administration of the Website business, including, but not limited to, all Fulfillment Services. In furtherance of  this launch\n\n2\n\nSource: PLAYBOY ENTERPRISES INC, 10-Q/A, 2/20/2009\n\n\n\n\n\n   date, EFS and Client shall perform all activities and deliver all deliverables in accordance with the time and action calendar. Client  acknowledges that if it is unable to perform any obligations within the time period agreed to in the time and action calendar that the  launch of the Websites may be delayed accordingly.    (ii) Client and EFS acknowledge that design and functionality of the Websites consistent with best  practices for e-commerce is critical to ensure the maximum sales performance of the Websites and to maintain the goodwill of  Client's customers. EFS will utilize best industry practices to maintain the shopping areas of the Websites in order to ensure that  such areas feature functionality that is deemed best practice in the e-commerce industry and is updated with all content and brand  imagery necessary to keep the shopping areas of the Websites up-to-date and fresh, in all instances maintaining the high level of  brand integrity of the PLAYBOY brand while focusing on customer experience. From time to time, Client will provide updated  photo and brand elements for purposes of utilization by EFS in Website design.    (iii) In addition to any guidelines provided by Client, EFS shall use and comply with any style guides  provided by Client to ensure consistency among retail channels (e.g., graphics, patterns, colors, logos, etc.), visual brand displays  and seasonal color palettes. EFS shall maintain the shopping areas of the Websites consistent with the style guides (as modified for  e-commerce) to maximize sales, brand appearance and marketability. Client will provide new brand and content assets from time- to-time along with updated style guides in both digital and hard copies, and EFS will update the Websites and future Catalogs  accordingly within a commercially reasonable time following receipt. As of the Effective Date hereof, updated style guides are  provided twice per year. EFS will have not less than six (6) months advance notice of upcoming new style guides.    (iv) EFS will host all content displayed on the Websites on an EFS-hosted server provided by EFS at its  sole cost and expense. EFS may at its election use a reputable third party hosting service to host the Websites; provided,  however, that EFS shall nevertheless be responsible for ensuring the availability of the Websites as set forth in this Agreement.  EFS shall provide as required all updates of content on the Websites, including enhancements, modifications and additions thereto.   (v) EFS agrees to at all times during the Term use its best efforts to market the Websites no less diligently  than it does other online properties managed by EFS on behalf of third parties (including without limitation, maintaining best  practice functionality, search engine optimization tactics, utilizing customer acquisition and retention campaigns, etc.).    (vi) EFS shall take all reasonable measures to ensure the performance of each of the Websites, including,  at a minimum, availability at least ninety-nine and one-half percent (99.5%) of the time per month as averaged over any one (1)  month period, excepting scheduled maintenance or a Force Majeure Event (as defined in Section 14.7).    (vii) Subject to the prior, written approval of Client, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, EFS shall  have the right at its sole cost and expense to design and launch as many micro- and sub-domain websites as EFS deems  appropriate in order to take full\n\n3\n\nSource: PLAYBOY ENTERPRISES INC, 10-Q/A, 2/20/2009\n\n\n\n\n\n   advantage of online marketing channels (collectively, \"Micro Sites\"); provided, however, that all such Micro Sites shall be  designed and maintained consistent with the terms of this Agreement. At a minimum, EFS agrees to launch a version of the  PlayboyStore.com Website, which does not contain products or content containing nudity, marital aid or massager Merchandise,  within forty-five (45) days following launch of the PlayboyStore.com Website.     (viii) Front-End Platform. In the event that EFS chooses to use the Demandware, Inc. (\"Demandware\")  front-end platform software and services for the Websites, EFS shall enter into a separate agreement directly with Demandware;  provided, however, that the terms of any such agreement must be approved by Client in advance in writing.    (e) Catalogs    (i) EFS agrees that (A) the first issue of each of the Catalogs shall be sent to consumers by March 15,  2008; and (B) no later than March 1, 2008, EFS shall be ready to perform all aspects of administration of the Catalog business,  including, but not limited to, all Fulfillment Services.    (ii) EFS shall provide a copy of each Catalog to Client for review and approval not less than five (5)  business days prior to printing. EFS shall promptly make any changes to the Catalog as may be reasonably requested by Client.  No Catalog shall be sent to printing without the written approval of Client, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.    (f) Models and Photography. EFS agrees that all female models depicted in or in connection with the Playboy  Commerce Business shall be approved by Client and shall be Playmates (or other Playboy models, including, but not limited The  Girls Next Door) as requested by the Client unless otherwise mutually agreed in advance in writing by the parties. In addition,  EFS agrees to shoot major photography in connection with the Playboy Commerce Business in Los Angeles and in coordination  with Client, as requested by Client and in line with current and past practices (taking into account changes in Client's Catalog- related strategy) with respect to process, cost and frequency. EFS shall be responsible for all costs and expenses in connection  with such photography, including, but not limited to, payments to models and photographers, based upon an estimated schedule of  costs attached as Exhibit 4. EFS shall secure model and photographer releases in a form provided by Client and shall provide all  content created under this Section 1.1(f) to Client within thirty (30) days of creation. All such photographs shall be deemed  Playboy Content for purposes of this Agreement, for which EFS shall have a license to use during the Term solely in connection  with the Playboy Commerce Business and as is necessary to promote the Websites. During the Term, Client shall not be  permitted to sell or otherwise provide such photographs to third party retailers (except for those retailers operating under the  PLAYBOY brand) or Licensees (as defined in Section 2.4), without the prior written approval of EFS.     (i) Client shall own all content produced pursuant to Section 1.1(f) (whether or not actually used), and  EFS hereby assigns to Client all right, title and interest, including all rights in copyright, in and to the photographs and materials,  and agrees to cooperate with all reasonable requests by Client, and take all reasonable actions, to effect or perfect such  assignment. EFS hereby provides Client with an irrevocable power of attorney appointing Client as its irrevocable attorney-in-fact  coupled with an interest to execute all such assignments on\n\n4\n\nSource: PLAYBOY ENTERPRISES INC, 10-Q/A, 2/20/2009\n\n\n\n\n\n   behalf of EFS in the event that EFS fails to do so within thirty (30) days following written request by Client. Client hereby grants  to EFS a limited and perpetual right and license to use such photographs and materials for research and forecasting purposes,  including, but not limited to, combining the same with reports and analytics concerning the performance of the Websites, providing  information to strategic partners to better define consumer purchasing habits, and for trend forecasting and planning purposes. In  addition, during the Term, EFS may use such photographs and materials to provide information to Client Licensees to better  define consumer purchasing habits, refine the design and performance of the Websites and EFS Portals on which the Merchandise  is sold in connection with any EFS Analysis (as defined below), and for marketing and planning purposes. For the avoidance of  doubt, no information provided to third parties under this Section 1.1(i) shall: (i) specifically or by inference identify or in any way  reference Client; (ii) disclose any proprietary information of Client; or (iii) disclose any personally identifiable information of or  otherwise identify any consumer of the Websites or the Catalogs.     (g) Compliance with Guidelines.

Payments and Fees.\n\n16\n\nSource: PLAYBOY ENTERPRISES INC, 10-Q/A, 2/20/2009\n\n\n\n\n\n   6.1. Royalties. EFS shall pay a royalty (\"Royalty\") to Client to be calculated and paid as follows: (a) the Royalty shall be  determined based upon the percentage applicable to the Merchandise Gross Margin (pursuant to the chart in Exhibit 10, attached  hereto and hereby incorporated by reference); (b) multiplied by the Net Merchandise Sales (as defined below) as applicable in  each case for the applicable Calendar Quarter or Year (each as defined below). The Royalty calculation period shall begin upon  the first order received by EFS via any order channel (e.g., on a Website, via mail, fax or telephone) and shall be paid to Client  within fifteen (15) days following the conclusion of each calendar quarter (\"Calendar Quarter\") based on the calendar year  (\"Year\"), as calculated on the actual Merchandise Gross Margin and Net Merchandise Sales (each as defined below) for such  Calendar Quarter.    (a) For purposes of this Agreement, \"Merchandise Gross Margin\" shall be defined as the Net Merchandise Sales  through the Playboy Commerce Business during the applicable Calendar Quarter or Year, less (i) the actual unit cost of goods  sold paid by EFS for the manufacture of such goods, which shall not include expenses relating to overhead or allocations, (ii)  reductions for markdowns, discounts and allowances, and (iii) actual Merchandise inventory shrinkage during the same period,  which shall in no event exceed *****. The Merchandise Gross Margin scale for purposes of calculating the Royalty shall be  determined from Exhibit 10 based upon the Minimum Royalty (as defined in Section 6.2) set forth in Exhibit 10.    (b) For purpose of this Agreement, \"Net Merchandise Sales\" shall be defined as total Merchandise sales derived  through the Playboy Commerce Business via any order channel less applicable, actual Merchandise returns, if any, during the  applicable Calendar Quarter.    (c) Pursuant to Section 3.6, EFS shall pay a quarterly Royalty to Client calculated as set forth in Section 6.1  using separate Royalty percentages on a country-by-country basis based on product margins for each such country, as agreed  upon by the parties.    6.2. Minimum Royalty. Notwithstanding revenue actually generated by EFS in connection with the Playboy Commerce  Business hereunder, it is understood and agreed that the Royalty paid to Client in each Year of the Term shall not be less than the  amounts set forth in Exhibit 10 (the \"Minimum Royalty\"). In the event the Minimum Royalty is not achieved in any Year based on  the Royalty payments made in such Year, EFS shall pay the shortfall between the Royalty earned and the applicable Minimum  Royalty due, if any, within sixty (60) days of the end of such Year.    (a) In the event that the Minimum Royalty is met in any applicable Year, (i) EFS shall not be permitted to carry  over any overages into the next Year and (ii) EFS will not be eligible for any refund from any Minimum Royalty or Royalty  previously owed or paid to Client. In the event EFS does not meet the full amount of the Minimum Royalty during the applicable  Year in which such Minimum Royalty was owed to Client, EFS will not be permitted to offset the shortfall with any overages from  any previous or subsequent Year, and a new Minimum Royalty will be due as set forth in this Section 6.2. For the avoidance of  doubt, the Minimum Royalty is a minimum net sum from which no taxes or charges of any sort may be deducted.\n\n17\n\nSource: PLAYBOY ENTERPRISES INC, 10-Q/A, 2/20/2009\n\n\n\n\n\n   (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated prior to the end of the Initial Term, any portion of the Year 1  Minimum Royalty that has been spread across Years 2 through 5 of the Term pursuant to Exhibit 10 and which has not yet been  paid to Client, shall immediately become due and owing.    6.3. Royalty on Shipping Charges. In addition, Client shall be entitled to receive a royalty payment on the shipping and  handling charges paid by customers during the applicable Calendar Quarter (\"Shipping Royalty\") equal to the Royalty percentage  multiplied by the shipping profit. For purposes of this Section 6.3, the shipping profit shall be calculated as the gross charges for  shipping less shipping materials, cost of freight and dunnage. The Shipping Royalties paid to Client shall be counted towards the  Minimum Royalty for the applicable Year. If there is no shipping profit, Client shall not be owed any Shipping Royalty, nor will  Client be impacted by any shipping losses.    6.4. Advertising Revenues. Client shall be entitled to receive an advertising fee of ***** of the Net Advertising Revenue  derived by EFS from Advertisements pursuant to Section 4.4 (\"Advertising Fee\"). \"Net Advertising Revenue\" shall be defined as  the gross revenue derived from the sale of Advertisements less: (a) all direct costs (i.e., commissions and ad-server related fees)  incurred by EFS and third party fees paid out by EFS for the execution, maintenance and ongoing facilitation of Advertisements  on the Websites and (b) ***** of gross revenue derived from the sale of Advertisements, which shall be reinvested by EFS for  online promotions and advertising (\"Advertising Marketing Allocation\").

EFS understands and agrees that any and all EFS Produced Merchandise and any other items bearing the Playboy Marks or  intended for use in connection with the Merchandise (hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Materials\") must be approved  in advance in writing by Client through Client's online approval submission system. The Materials include, but are not limited  to, photography, cartons, containers, labels, wrappers, packaging and other inner and outer packaging materials, fixtures,  displays, artwork and printing, advertising, sales, marketing and promotional materials. EFS shall, at its own expense, submit  to Client or its designee for written approval, samples of any EFS Produced Merchandise and the Materials at each stage of  development thereof, which shall include, but not be limited to: (i) an initial sketch or photograph prior to any manufacture  thereof; (ii) a sample prototype or equivalent acceptable to Client; and (iii) two final production-quality samples of that which  will be mass produced or manufactured. EFS must obtain Client's written approval of each stage of development before  proceeding to the next stage, and in no event shall EFS commence or permit the mass manufacture, advertising, promotion,  sale or distribution of any EFS Produced Merchandise or Materials unless and until EFS has received Client's written  approval of the samples provided pursuant to (iii) of this Section 1. In the event Client fails to provide its approval or  disapproval of any or all things submitted to Client pursuant to this Section 1 within ***** of Client's receipt thereof, EFS  may send written notice to Client advising no response was received. If Client does not respond within ***** of Client's  receipt thereof, then Client shall be deemed to have given disapproval.    2. To ensure that EFS Produced Merchandise and the Materials are constantly maintained in conformance with the previously  approved samples pursuant to Section 1 of this Exhibit 9 above, EFS shall, within ten (10) days of receipt of a request from  Client, send or cause to be sent to Client at EFS' expense: (i) such actual samples requested by Client of the EFS Produced  Merchandise and the Materials EFS is using, manufacturing, selling, distributing or otherwise disposing of; and (ii) a listing or  revised listing of each location where any of the EFS Produced Merchandise and the Materials or either thereof are designed,  manufactured, stored or otherwise dealt with, except to the extent such listing or revised listing duplicates currently accurate  information previously provided. Client and its nominees, employees, agents and representatives shall have the right to enter  upon and inspect, at all reasonable hours of the day, any and all such location(s) and to take, without payment, individual  samples of any of the EFS Produced Merchandise and the Materials as Client reasonably requires for the purposes of such  inspection.    3. If any of the EFS Produced Merchandise or Materials sent or taken pursuant to Section 2 of this Exhibit 9 above or that  otherwise come to the attention of Client does or do not conform in Client's sole opinion to the previously approved samples,  Client shall so notify EFS, in writing, specifying in what respect such of the EFS Produced Merchandise or Materials is or are  unacceptable. Immediately upon receipt of such notice, EFS shall suspend all manufacture, sale and distribution of all such  EFS Produced Merchandise and Materials and shall not resume the manufacture, sale or distribution thereof unless and until  EFS has made\n\n42\n\nSource: PLAYBOY ENTERPRISES INC, 10-Q/A, 2/20/2009\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    all necessary changes to the satisfaction of Client and has received Client's written re-approval of each of such EFS  Produced Merchandise and Materials.    4. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, all EFS Produced Merchandise and/or Materials that are not  approved by Client or that are determined by Client to be non-conforming or unacceptable shall not be sold, distributed or  otherwise dealt with by EFS. All such EFS Produced Merchandise and Materials shall be destroyed by EFS with, if Client so  requests, an appropriate certificate of destruction furnished to Client.    5. Any and all sales, distribution or use by EFS of unapproved, non-conforming or unacceptable EFS Produced Merchandise  or Materials shall not only constitute an incurable default under the terms of this Agreement, but such EFS Produced  Merchandise or Materials also shall be considered unlicensed and an infringement of Client's proprietary rights, and Client  shall have the right to bring legal action against EFS for any and all remedies available to Client in addition to the remedies  available under this Agreement. EFS acknowledges and agrees that to the extent EFS has followed the approval process as  outlined in this Exhibit 9 with respect to EFS Produced Merchandise, EFS shall have had notice of any non-approval, non- conformance and/or unacceptability thereof.    6.

If Affiliate fails to notify Network of its desire that this Agreement terminate on its expiration date, at least six (6) months before the expiration date, this Agreement will automatically renew, upon the same terms and conditions, for an additional four (4) -year period (\"Renewal Term\").   (c) If the Term is renewed as described in Section 2(b), Network and Affiliate will negotiate exclusively and in good faith concerning further renewal of this Agreement upon mutually-agreed terms and conditions; provided, that unless Network and Affiliate otherwise agree in writing, the exclusive negotiation period will end six (6) months before the expiration of the Term.   3.GRANT OF RIGHTS; ACQUIRED STATIONS:   (a) Network hereby grants to Affiliate the exclusive right via Broadcast Television, and Affiliate hereby accepts such exclusive right and the obligation during the Term to broadcast the Service via Broadcast Television (i) over the transmission facilities of each Station identified on Exhibit A, which is licensed by the FCC to serve the community for each such Station (the \"Licensed Community\"), for receipt by TV Households in the DMA in which the Licensed Community is located, as such DMA is identified on Exhibit A, and (ii) over the transmission facilities of any Acquired Station, except to the extent that, as of the date Affiliate notifies Network in writing of its binding agreement to acquire such Acquired Station, (A) another Broadcast Television station in the same DMA as the Acquired Station has exclusive rights to broadcast the Service, or (B) the Acquired Station is obligated to broadcast other material that precludes it from also carrying the Service. Affiliate shall telecast the Service from each Station's origination transmitter and antenna for free over-the-air television reception, and by other customary means used by each Station to transmit its signal in its DMA (e.g., FCC-licensed translators and fiber or microwave connections to MVPDs). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Affiliate shall have the right to authorize, and shall use reasonable efforts to obtain, carriage of the Service's signal by MVPDs that retransmit digital Broadcast Television signals in the DMA of each Station that transmits the Service, which Service signal shall be transmitted by Affiliate together with the Primary Feed. Affiliate's failure to obtain such carriage by any MVPD shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement. Affiliate shall endeavor to secure carriage of the Service by MVPDs on the most highly penetrated level of digital service. Further, Affiliate shall have the right to authorize carriage of the Service's signal on a nonexclusive basis by MVPDs that retransmit a Station's Primary Feed outside the Station's DMA, and that are carrying the Station's analog signal as of the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding sentence, (1) Affiliate shall not authorize an MVPD to deliver the Service to subscribers outside the Station's DMA in areas in which the Station, pursuant to FCC rules, is not \"significantly viewed,\" if the MVPD receives the Station's signal via satellite, and (2) any agreement by Affiliate for out-of-DMA carriage of the Service shall require that the MVPD's authorization from Affiliate to carry the Service terminate upon the initial over- the-air transmission of the Service by a Broadcast Television station whose Licensed Community is located within the DMA of the pertinent MVPD system if such station has exclusive rights to broadcast the Service in such DMA. Network shall provide Affiliate with at least 45 days' advance written notice of such Broadcast Television's station's initial over-the-air transmission of the Service and Affiliate shall provide such notice to the pertinent MVPD. In the event Affiliate owns more than one Station in any DMA (a \"Duopoly Market\"), then Affiliate, at its option, shall have the right to determine which of its Stations in such DMA shall broadcast the Service; it being understood that Affiliate shall have no obligation to broadcast the Service over more than one of its Stations in any particular DMA.   3\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006\n\n\n\n\n\n  (b) Any Acquired Station that is transmitting the Service at the time of acquisition by Affiliate shall (subject to the provisions of the preceding paragraph concerning Duopoly Markets) continue to transmit the Service and become a \"Station\" hereunder. Any existing agreement between or among Network and any one or more third parties applicable to such Station for the transmission of the Service shall terminate and cease to be effective upon its acquisition by Affiliate. Any Acquired Station in a DMA that is not transmitting the Service at the time of acquisition by Affiliate shall likewise become a \"Station\" hereunder upon acquisition and shall commence transmitting the Service within one hundred eighty (180) days after the acquisition is consummated, unless, as provided in 3(a) above, (A) another Broadcast Television station in the same DMA as the Acquired Station has exclusive rights to broadcast the Service, or (B) the Acquired Station is obligated to broadcast other material that precludes it from also carrying the Service. If condition (A) or (B) applies, the Acquired Station shall have no obligations hereunder, and Network shall have the right to license the transmission of the Service to another Broadcast Television station in such DMA, including on an exclusive basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if condition (A) applies, unless the existing affiliate is a Charter Affiliate, Network shall give Affiliate at least six (6) months' prior written notice of the impending expiration of an existing affiliate's affiliation agreement and, upon such notice, Affiliate shall have the option to add the pertinent Acquired Station as a \"Station\" hereunder as of the date of expiration of the existing affiliate's affiliation agreement, provided that Affiliate exercises such right in writing at least four (4) months prior to the expiration of the existing affiliate's affiliation agreement.   (c) Except as expressly provided in Section 3(a), Affiliate shall not have the right (i) to subdistribute or otherwise sublicense the Service, or (ii) to transmit or otherwise distribute the Service by any technology (other than Broadcast Television), or on an interactive, time- delayed, \"video-on-demand\" or similar basis. For purposes hereof, \"video-on-demand\" means the transmission of a television signal by means of a point-to-point distribution system containing audiovisual programming chosen by a viewer for reception on a viewer's television receiver, where the scheduling of the exhibition of the programming is not predetermined by the distributor, but rather is at the viewer's discretion.\n\n(d) Except as expressly provided in Sections 3(a) and 3(b) and this Section 3(d), Network shall not have the right to distribute or otherwise license the Service for reception in a Station's DMA, including distributing the Service directly through an MVPD in a Station's DMA, other than through this license to Affiliate. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, Network shall not distribute or authorize third parties to distribute the Service to subscribers by any technology (other than Broadcast Television and transmission by an MVPD), on an interactive, time-delayed (other than multiple time-zone feeds of the Service), \"video-on-demand\" or similar basis, as an audio-only service (e.g., radio) or over the Internet. For purposes of clarification, a promotional or marketing \"stunt\" simulcasting a live or special event, or brief excerpts of the Service made available on a non-subscription basis for promotional purposes shall not be prohibited by this Section 3(d) or any other provision herein.\n\n4\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006\n\n\n\n\n\n  (e) Network hereby grants Affiliate during the Term a royalty-free, fully paid up, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to use the Marks (as defined in Section 8(e)) in any advertising and promotional materials undertaken in connection with Affiliate's transmission of the Service, provided that such use complies with the terms and conditions of Section 8(e).   (f) Upon execution of this Agreement, Affiliate shall promptly complete and deliver to Network a notice of launch (in the form attached hereto in Exhibit B) for each Station (\"Launch Notice\") and subsequently launch the Service on each Station listed on Exhibit A (subject to the provisions of 3(a) above concerning Duopoly Markets) no later than the Launch Date set forth opposite each Station on Exhibit A (for each Station, the \"Launch Date\"). In addition, Affiliate shall promptly complete a Launch Notice for any Acquired Station that is subsequently added to this Agreement.   (g) Each Station, by the terms of this contract, shall be entitled to invoke the protection against duplication of Service programming imported under the compulsory copyright license as provided in Sections 76.101 and 76.123 of the FCC Rules.    (h) Each Station transmitting the Service shall have the right to broadcast the Service on its Primary Feed, in addition to its broadcasts under Section 3(a). Such broadcasts shall be subject to all terms and conditions of this Agreement, including Sections 4(e) and 8(c).   4.CONTENT OF THE SERVICE:   (a) Content. Throughout the Term, the Service shall be a professionally produced, advertiser-supported television service with programming consisting of music videos, occasional programs discussing, reviewing and/or relating to music and concerts, related interstitial programming, promotional announcements and commercial announcements in the amounts specified herein, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, primarily targeted to reach adults ages 25-54. Subject to the preceding sentence and other provisions of this Agreement, the selection, scheduling, renewal, substitution and withdrawal of any content on the Service shall at all times remain within Network's sole discretion and control.   (b) Local Programming. Affiliate, at its own cost, shall be provided with thirty (30) minutes per week on the Service, on the same day and at the same time each week, as determined by Network in consultation with Affiliate, for the insertion of programming by Affiliate that is complementary to the Service (\"Local Programming\"), at Affiliate's option. Service programming will be provided during this thirty (30) -minute period for Stations that do not insert Local Programming. It is anticipated that, at a future date to be mutually agreed upon by the parties, Affiliate shall have the right to expand such Local Programming to one (1) hour per week. Affiliate shall be solely responsible for the insertion on a timely basis of the Local Programming into the signal of the Service at the Stations transmitting the Service. Affiliate shall retain all revenue derived from sponsorship of the Local Programming. Affiliate shall apply the same broadcast standards to the Local Programming that it applies to each Station's broadcasts over the Primary Feed. Without limiting the immediately preceding sentence, Local Programming shall not consist of or contain infomercials, home shopping or direct on air sales programming that are not directly related to music and concerts.\n\n5\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Preemption. Affiliate shall retain the right to elect not to transmit any programming on the Service over the broadcast facilities of a Station if Affiliate reasonably believes that such programming is unsatisfactory or unsuitable or contrary to the public interest, or in order to substitute a program which, in Affiliate's judgment, is of greater local or national importance. Affiliate agrees to notify Network either before or as soon as reasonably practicable after Affiliate exercises such right.\n\n(d) Children's Programming.   (i) Network will provide as part of the Service the minimum number of hours of \"Core Programming,\" as defined in 47 C.F.R. \u00a773.671(c), as the same may be amended from time to time (\"Core Children's Programming\"), and will comply with related requirements of the definition of \"Core Programming\" in order to enable Affiliate to comply with the \"safe harbor\" established by law or FCC regulation, solely with regard to the Service and as a result of the broadcast by the Stations of the Service on each such Station's free, over-the-air, multicast feed.   (ii) Network represents and warrants that if it supplies to Affiliate any programming produced primarily for children 12 years old or younger, such programming shall comply with the FCC's commercial limits, including 47 C.F.R. \u00a773.670, as the same may be amended from time to time, including limits on the amount of commercial matter and the prohibitions on host-selling, program- length commercials and the display of website addresses.   (iii) At the end of each calendar quarter, Network will provide to Affiliate a copy of the Service's schedule of Core Children's Programming planned for the following calendar quarter, together with a certification indicating the amount of Core Children's Programming made available to Affiliate during the preceding quarter and certifying that any programming produced primarily for children 12 years old or younger, as provided by Network, complied with the FCC's rules. Network will provide copies of program logs or other documentation substantiating the amount of Core Children's Programming or the amount of commercial matter in any Network program or program segment subject to the commercial limits, promptly upon request by Affiliate.\n\n(e) Advertising. Except for the Local Advertising and advertising broadcast in Local Programming, Network shall have the exclusive right and authority to sell all of the advertising on the Service and shall share a portion of Network's Advertising Revenue generated from such sales with Affiliate in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. A Station will not be obligated to broadcast advertising that does not comply with the Station's generally applicable broadcast standards. Network and Affiliate will cooperate in a good-faith effort to ensure that all Network advertising meets Stations' broadcast standards. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, Network will not accept political or controversial-issue advertising, or advertising promoting distilled spirits or gambling, without Affiliate's prior written approval.   (f) Program Service Information. Network must provide to a reputable program information services entity a program schedule for the Service.   6\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006\n\n\n\n\n\n(g) Closed Captioning; Program Ratings. Network shall provide full-time closed captioning for the Service in all programming and at all times for which captioning is required by applicable law as applied to the Service. Network also shall display and encode program ratings for the Service using the industry-standard \"V-chip\" ratings system.   5.DELIVERY AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE SERVICE:\n\n(a) During the Term, Network, at its expense, shall deliver a 24 hours per day, 7 days per week signal of the Service by transmitting it via AMC-3 or another domestic satellite commonly used for transmission of television programming to Broadcast Television stations. The signal of the Service, including any program-related data and enhancements, shall be contained in no more than a 5.0 megabits-per-second (\"mbps\") stream of data and shall consist of a resolution of no less than 480 x 720i. Network's failure, for reasons other than force majeure, to deliver a signal meeting the requirements of this Section 5(a) for more than twelve (12) hours in any consecutive thirty (30) day period without the written consent of Affiliate shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement, not subject to the cure provisions of Section 10(d); provided, however that Affiliate shall provide Network with notice of each event in which Network fails to deliver a signal meeting the requirements of this Section 5(a) as soon as reasonably practicable.   (b) Exhibit C sets forth the specific equipment necessary for each Station to receive the signal of the Service (the \"Receiving Equipment\"). At Affiliate's option, Network shall furnish and install, at its expense, or reimburse Affiliate for its cost of furnishing and installing, the Receiving Equipment to each Station that transmits the Service, provided that the Receiving Equipment for all of the Stations initially listed on Exhibit A shall not exceed, in the aggregate, one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars ($125,000.00) (the \"Equipment Reimbursement Cap\"). At Affiliate's option, Network also shall furnish and install, or reimburse Affiliate for its cost of furnishing and installing, Receiving Equipment for any Acquired Station not transmitting the Service at the time of acquisition by Affiliate, at a cost not to exceed three thousand five hundred dollars ($3,500.00). Affiliate, at its expense, shall furnish all other equipment and facilities necessary for the receipt of the satellite transmission of the signal of the Service and the delivery of such signal to TV Households in each Station's DMA. In addition, each Station shall be responsible, at its sole expense, for installing, maintaining or repairing the Receiving Equipment during the Term. Affiliate shall cause each of the Stations to maintain and repair the Receiving Equipment in good working condition, at its sole cost, as necessary and appropriate to maintain the ability of the Receiving Equipment to receive the signal of the Service from its initial satellite and transponder without interruption during the Term. If Network changes the satellite, transponder or encryption method used to transmit the Service and if the Receiving Equipment or other existing equipment will not be suitable for receiving the Service after the changes are implemented, with respect to such Station(s), Network agrees to furnish and install at its expense, or reimburse Affiliate for its reasonable cost of furnishing and installing, Receiving Equipment suitable for receiving the Service after the changes are implemented, without regard to the Equipment Reimbursement Cap; provided, however, that with respect to new equipment made necessary by a satellite, transponder or encryption method change, which equipment may be used to receive the signals of other television services carried by such Station, Network shall be obligated to reimburse Affiliate only for Network's pro-rata share of the cost of such equipment (based on the total number of television services being received by such affected System and utilizing such new equipment within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such change).\n\n7\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Each Station transmitting the Service shall transmit a good-quality video and audio signal of the Service, but in no event shall such Station be required to deliver a signal of a technical quality higher than the technical quality of the video and audio signal of the Service as delivered by Network hereunder.   (d) Each Station agrees to transmit the Service on a full-time basis 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, except in cases of force majeure, emergency broadcasts, when a Station's Primary Feed is not being transmitted, as provided in 4(c) above, or when a Station must stop broadcasting for maintenance or repairs. Each Station will provide Network with up to 5.0 mbps, but, at all times, not less than 2.0 mbps, for this purpose, except as required in infrequent and exceptional circumstances resulting from a Station's carriage of the primary television network with which such Station is affiliated with regard to its Primary Feed (e.g., ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox). Except for a Station's Local Advertising Time and Local Programming, station identification messages, and as except provided in 4(c) and 4(e) above, each Station shall transmit the Service without alteration, editing or delay.   (e)  Network agrees to transmit SCTE 35-compliant DPI commands within the Service that will trigger insertion of Local Advertising and rejoin commands to signal the return to Network programming. Network also will deliver a separate set of SCTE 35-compliant commands to trigger local insertion and removal of station identification messages on the hour, and station logos before and after commercial breaks. To ensure clean switching, Network will ensure that switch commands occur coincident with transmission of an \"I\"-frame from the network MPEG 2 encoder.   (f) Each Station that transmits the Service may superimpose over the programming on the Service a transparent station identification logo/\"bug\" that does not materially interfere with the Service or any graphics or other data therein.   (g) Affiliate and each Station shall take the same security measures to prevent the unauthorized or otherwise unlawful copying or taping of the Service (or any portion thereof) by others as it takes to protect the Primary Feed transmitted by such Station. Network acknowledges that Affiliate and the Stations do not, as of the Effective Date, take any such security measures.   6.NO FEES; REVENUE SHARE:\n\n(a) Neither Affiliate nor any Station shall pay any fees to Network for any rights granted under this Agreement.   (b) In consideration of the terms and conditions set forth herein, Network shall pay Affiliate (i) the Affiliate Advertising Share, and (ii) the Affiliate Transactional Share, each as provided in Exhibit D.   7.REPORTS; AUDITS:   (a) Affiliate shall promptly notify Network in writing of any MVPD that has agreed to retransmit the Service. Network and Affiliate thereafter shall cooperate in an effort to secure the MVPD's agreement to provide to Network and Affiliate, within thirty (30) days following each calendar quarter during the Term, a certified report stating the number of households that receive the Service from such MVPD (\"Digital Cable Subscriber Households\") in the DMA of a Station on average over such quarter (\"Report\"). If an MVPD fails to submit a Report, Network and Affiliate shall estimate the number of Digital Cable Subscriber Households receiving the Service pursuant to paragraph I.1. of Exhibit D.\n\n8\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006\n\n\n\n\n\n  (b) Network shall submit to Affiliate, within forty-five (45) days of the end of each calendar quarter during the Term, a statement reporting for such calendar quarter the following information on a Station-by-Station basis: (i) Network's Advertising Revenue, (ii) the Affiliate Advertising Share, (iii) Network's Transactional Revenue, (iv) the average number of households receiving the Service through each MVPD in each DMA served by a Station, as calculated herein, and (v) the Affiliate Transactional Share. If this Agreement terminates on any date other than at the end of a calendar quarter, Network shall supply such statement as of the date of termination, within forty-five (45) days thereafter, and this obligation shall survive the termination of this Agreement until Affiliate receives such statement.   (c) Affiliate shall submit to Network, within forty-five (45) days of the end of each calendar quarter, a report on behalf of each Station with respect to the Promotional Spots aired by each Station during such calendar quarter, setting forth the date and time each such Promotional Spot aired on the Primary Feed.   (d) Audit.   (i) During the Term and for one (1) year thereafter, Network shall maintain accurate and complete books and records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and practices that shall contain sufficient information to enable an auditor to verify, for the period under audit, Network's Advertising Revenue, Network's Transactional Revenue, the Affiliate Advertising Share, the Affiliate Transactional Share and the accuracy of the amounts paid by Network to Affiliate hereunder, including under Exhibit D (collectively, the \"Revenue Share Records\"). Upon not less than thirty (30) days' prior written notice and not more than once in any calendar year, Affiliate shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense, during the Term and for one (1) year thereafter, to examine during normal business hours the books and records of Network for up to the prior calendar year and the then-current calendar year solely to the extent reasonably necessary to verify the Revenue Share Records.   (ii) Any audit conducted pursuant to this Section 7(d) shall be conducted by Affiliate's corporate audit staff or an independent auditing firm designated by Affiliate (in each case, an \"Auditor\"). Any such audit shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 7(d) and the confidentiality provisions of Section 12, and the Auditor shall execute, in advance, a confidentiality agreement that obligates it to maintain the confidentiality of the terms of this Agreement and the information acquired during the course of the audit. Any officer, employee, consultant or agent of Affiliate that has access to an audit report (who shall be limited to those who are members of Affiliate's corporate audit staff and have a specific need to know the contents thereof) shall also execute a confidentiality agreement consistent with the prior sentence.   9\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006\n\n\n\n\n\n  (iii) Network and Affiliate shall use good faith efforts to resolve any dispute arising from an audit conducted pursuant to this Section 7(d). Any litigation by Affiliate with respect to amounts owing by Network in respect of an audit must be brought within one (1) year after the Auditor completes its on-site review at Network's offices, or Affiliate will be deemed to have waived its right, whether known or unknown, to collect any shortfalls from Network for the period(s) audited; provided, however, that such limitation shall not apply to intentional misconduct by Network or its agents or employees.   8.PROMOTION; AFFILIATE ADVERTISING:   (a) Affiliate shall actively promote the Service consistent with its business judgment, including the broadcast by each Station transmitting the Service of an average of at least ten (10) thirty (30)-second promotional announcements per week for the Service (\"Promotional Spots\") on the Station's Primary Feed, including the Station's analog signal for so long as the Station broadcasts an analog signal, on a run-of- station basis, commencing no later than the first air date of the Service on the applicable Station. Affiliate will submit program listings for the Service to local print and on-screen guides. Additionally, Affiliate will provide a link to Network's website (i.e., URL www.thetubetv.com or any replacement or supplemental URL) on the websites of each of the Stations.\n\n(b) Network shall produce and deliver the Promotional Spots to each Station at least two (2) weeks prior to the first air date, and on a regular basis thereafter, in a format mutually agreed with Affiliate and in a broadcast-ready state. Affiliate or a Station also may prepare its own Promotional Spots and other promotional materials, which, if using any programming from the Service, must be approved in advance by Network, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. Network and Affiliate agree to consult on a regular basis during the Term concerning the content of the Promotional Spots, promotional materials and on Network and Affiliate promotional strategies, and Affiliate shall cease airing particular Promotional Spots or using particular promotional materials upon the reasonable objection of Network to such Promotional Spots or the use of such promotional materials.   (c) Network shall provide to each Station that transmits the Service for local advertising sales, public service announcements, newsbreaks, station-produced vignettes or promotion one (1) minute of commercial announcement time per hour (\"Local Advertising\"), normally at the same approximate time each hour of the broadcast day. Affiliate shall have the right to retain for itself all the proceeds derived from the sale of Local Advertising. Affiliate agrees not to sell commercial time to or for the benefit of direct competitors of the Service (e.g., music video networks carried by MVPDs such as MTV, VH1 and Fuse). All Local Advertising shall comply with the pertinent Station's generally applicable broadcast standards and Affiliate shall be solely responsible for all Local Advertising and all liabilities associated therewith, including insertion, trafficking, billing and collection activities relating to the Local Advertising and for the content of the material inserted into the Local Advertising.   (d) Network, from time to time, may undertake marketing tests and surveys, rating polls and other research in connection with the Service. With respect to any tests, surveys or research that apply to any Station or DMA for which Network seeks Affiliate's cooperation, Network shall notify Affiliate of the nature and scope of each such project and Affiliate, to the extent permitted by applicable law and agreements by which Affiliate or a Station is bound, shall cooperate in such research by rendering such assistance as Network may reasonably request and which Affiliate can reasonably provide without incurring any additional expense. Network shall, promptly following receipt, provide the full results of any such research to Affiliate, on a confidential basis, unless Network is prevented from doing so by a confidentiality agreement or applicable law.\n\n10\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006\n\n\n\n\n\n  (e) Affiliate acknowledges that the name and mark \"The TUBE\" (and the names of certain programs that appear in the Service and any subsequently selected names or marks for the Service and accompanying websites) (collectively, the \"Marks\") are the exclusive property of Network and its suppliers and that Affiliate has not and will not acquire any ownership thereof by reason of this Agreement. Provided they do not infringe the marks of Affiliate or an affiliate of Affiliate, Affiliate shall not directly or indirectly question, attack, contest or in any other manner impugn the validity of the Marks or Network's rights in and to the Marks and shall reasonably cooperate with Network's quality control, monitoring and inspection of the use of the Marks. Any and all goodwill arising from Affiliate's use of the Marks shall inure solely to the benefit of Network. Affiliate shall submit to Network representative samples of Affiliate's promotional materials mentioning or using the Marks (other than materials provided by Network to Affiliate, if any) and shall cease using the Marks in a particular manner upon the reasonable objection of Network to the use of the Marks in such manner. Uses of the Marks in routine promotional materials, such as program guides and program listings, shall be deemed approved unless Network specifically notifies Affiliate to the contrary. Network shall acquire no rights in any of Affiliate's marks by virtue of this Agreement.   9.WARRANTIES AND INDEMNITIES:\n\n(a) Network and Affiliate each represents and warrants to the other that (i) it is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state under which it is organized; (ii) it has the power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform fully its obligations hereunder; (iii) it is under no contractual or other legal obligation that shall in any way interfere with its full, prompt and complete performance hereunder; (iv) the individual executing this Agreement on its behalf has the authority to do so; and (v) the obligations created by this Agreement, insofar as they purport to be binding on it, constitute legal, valid and binding obligations enforceable in accordance with their terms.   (b) Network further represents and warrants to Affiliate that it holds all necessary rights and licenses in and to the materials transmitted to Affiliate as part of the Service and such rights and licenses are sufficient to permit the transmission of the Service in the DMA of each of the Stations as contemplated herein, without infringing the copyright or other rights of any person.   (c) Affiliate further represents, warrants and covenants to Network that (i) it has the power and authority to cause each Station, including any Acquired Station, to perform fully its obligations hereunder; and (ii) it holds and will continue to hold all necessary rights and licenses (A) to operate the Stations and permit the broadcast of the Service in the DMA of each of the Stations and (B) to broadcast the Local Programming and Local Advertising as contemplated herein.   11\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Affiliate and Network shall each indemnify, defend and forever hold harmless the other, the other's parent, subsidiary and affiliated companies and each of the other's (and the other's parent, subsidiary and affiliated companies') respective present and former officers, shareholders, directors, employees, consultants, partners and agents (\"Network Indemnitees\" and \"Affiliate Indemnitees,\" respectively), against and from any and all Costs incurred as a result of third-party claims arising out of any breach of any term of this Agreement or of any warranty, covenant or representation contained herein.   (e) Without limiting Section 9(d), Network shall indemnify, defend and forever hold harmless the Affiliate Indemnitees from and against any and all Costs arising directly or indirectly out of third-party claims (i) that the transmission by Affiliate of the Service as contemplated herein infringes the rights of any person, (ii) based on the content of the Service and any promotional material provided by Network to Affiliate (including the Promotional Spots), as furnished by Network and transmitted by Affiliate and each Station in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement (i.e., not based upon any deletions, modifications or additions by Affiliate or any Station), including any claim that such content or material is obscene, indecent, libelous, or slanderous, or violates any right of privacy or publicity, copyright, trademark or any other proprietary, literary, or dramatic right of any person or any rule or regulation of the FCC, and (iii) relating to any contest, sweepstakes or other promotion conducted by Network. Affiliate shall, to like extent, indemnify, defend and forever hold harmless the Network Indemnitees for Costs arising directly or indirectly out of third-party claims relating to (A) any deletion, addition or other modification of content, programming or other material by Affiliate to the Service, including Local Advertising and Local Programming, (B) any editing or deletion of program or promotional material by Affiliate contrary to Network's instructions, (C) Promotional Spots and/or other promotional materials prepared by Affiliate, and (D) any contest, sweepstakes or other promotion conducted by Affiliate in connection with Network and/or the Service.   (f) A party claiming indemnity under this Section 9 must give the indemnifying party prompt notice of any claim, and the indemnifying party shall, unless the parties otherwise agree, assume the full defense of any claims to which its indemnity applies. The indemnified party, at the indemnifying party's cost, will cooperate fully with the indemnifying party in the defense or settlement of any such claim. Subject to the foregoing, the indemnified party may participate in the defense, through counsel of its choice, at its own expense.   (g) The representations, warranties and indemnities contained in this Section 9 shall continue throughout the Term and the indemnities shall survive the termination of this Agreement, regardless of the reason for such termination.   (h) Network has procured, and shall maintain during the Term, at its sole expense, Commercial General Liability insurance at liability limits of not less than $1,000,000 each occurrence and $2,000,000 in the aggregate. Additionally, Network will procure on or before the Affiliate Launch Date, and shall maintain during the Term, at its sole expense, Errors and Omissions insurance that covers Network's media activities at a liability limit of $1,000,000 in any one (1) policy period. Affiliate shall be named as an additional insured on the policies, and, prior to the Affiliate Launch Date, shall receive certificates evidencing such insurance, providing that such coverage will not be cancelled or materially changed except upon 30 days' prior written notice to Affiliate.\n\n  12\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006\n\n\n\n\n\n  10.TERMINATION:   (a) In addition to Network's other rights to terminate this Agreement, Network may, by providing Affiliate with thirty (30) days' prior notice, terminate this Agreement if Affiliate is in material breach of this Agreement, provided that Affiliate shall have thirty (30) days from Network's notice specifying in detail the nature of such breach to cure such breach; provided, however, if such breach is confined to a single breach by a Station or group of Stations during the Term, then Network shall have the right to terminate this Agreement only as to such Station or Stations, but if Affiliate willfully and repeatedly materially breaches any of the material provisions of this Agreement, then Network, at its option, shall have the right to terminate this Agreement in its entirety or only as to such breaching Station or Stations.   (b) Network retains the right at all times during the Term to discontinue its distribution of the Service in its entirety and to terminate this Agreement and all other affiliates' agreements on at least ninety (90) days' prior notice without any liability therefor to Affiliate, other than amounts payable hereunder which accrued prior to such termination, including amounts payable pursuant to Section 6(b) and Exhibit D.   (c) In the event that a Station initially listed on Exhibit A does not launch the Service by the Launch Date as required by Section 3(f) other than as a result of a force majeure event pursuant to Section 13(e), Network shall have the right to terminate this Agreement only as to such Station, but if three (3) or more Stations initially listed on Exhibit A do not launch the Service by the pertinent Launch Date for each such Station as required by Section 3(f) for reasons other than force majeure, Network, at its option, shall have the right to terminate this Agreement in its entirety or only as to such Station or Stations. In the event that Network terminates this Agreement as to a particular Station or several Stations, or in its entirety pursuant to Sections 10(a) or (c), Affiliate shall, within thirty (30) days of termination, at its option either reimburse Network for the cost of all equipment or return such equipment related to such Station(s) that was paid for by Network pursuant to Section 5(b) herein.   (d) In addition to Affiliate's other rights to terminate this Agreement, Affiliate may, by providing Network with thirty (30) days' prior notice, terminate this Agreement if Network is in material breach of this Agreement, provided that Network shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of Affiliate's written notice specifying in detail the nature of such breach to cure such breach; provided, however, if such breach is confined to a Station or group of Stations during the Term, then Affiliate shall have the right to terminate this Agreement only as to such Station or Stations, but if Network willfully and repeatedly materially breaches any of the material provisions of this Agreement, then Affiliate, at its option, shall have the right to terminate this Agreement in its entirety or only as to such breaching Station or Stations.   (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contary in this Section 10, any breach involving failure to pay any amount due hereunder must be cured within ten (10) days after notice. A breach involving Network's failure to pay an amount due to Affiliate pursuant to Section 6 above or Exhibit D hereto shall be deemed a breach as to Affiliate rather than a particular Station or Stations.\n\n13\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006\n\n\n\n\n\n     11.

This Agreement shall be binding on the respective transferees and successors of the parties hereto, except that neither this Agreement nor either party's rights or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or transferred by either party without the prior written consent of the other party. Affiliate agrees to use reasonable efforts to obtain the agreement of any proposed assignee or transferee that, upon consummation of the assignment or transfer of control of the FCC license for any Station, such assignee or transferee shall negotiate in good faith with Network for continued rights to broadcast the Service over the affected Station. It will not be a breach of this Agreement, and Affiliate will not be required to accept a lower price or different terms in a proposed acquisition, if the proposed assignee or transferee does not accept this condition.

This Agreement, including the Exhibits attached hereto, contains the entire understanding of the parties hereto and supersedes and abrogates all contemporaneous and prior understandings of the parties, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be modified except in a writing executed by both parties hereto. No waiver of any breach of any provision hereof shall be or be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision of this Agreement. The failure of Affiliate or Network to enforce or seek enforcement of the terms of this Agreement following any breach shall not be construed as a waiver of a subsequent breach of the same or any other terms of this Agreement. All remedies, whether at law, in equity or pursuant to this Agreement shall be cumulative.   (c) Governing Law. The obligations of Affiliate and Network under this Agreement are subject to all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, and this Agreement and all matters or issues collateral thereto shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts to be entirely performed therein.   (d) Relationship. Neither party shall be, or hold itself out as, the agent of the other or as joint venturers under this Agreement. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to create, and the parties do not intend to create, any partnership, association, joint venture, fiduciary or agency relationship between Affiliate and Network, and neither party is authorized to or shall act toward third parties or the public in any manner which would indicate any such relationship with the other.   (e) Force Majeure. Neither Affiliate nor Network shall have any rights against the other party hereto for the non-operation of facilities or the non-furnishing of the Service if such non-operation or non-furnishing is due to an act of God; inevitable accident; fire; weather; lockout; strike or other labor dispute; riot or civil commotion; action or inaction of government or governmental instrumentality (whether federal, state or local); failure of performance by a common or private carrier; material failure or unavailability in whole or in part of technical facilities, software or equipment which are material to the transmission of the Service; or other cause beyond either party's reasonable control (financial inability is excepted). A party will have the right to terminate this Agreement as to the affected Station(s), by notice to the other, if the other party's inability to perform continues for thirty (30) days or more; provided, that Network may not terminate this Agreement due to a Station's failure to launch the Service for reasons specified solely in this Section 13(e) unless such Station is unable to launch the Service for ninety (90) days or more beyond the applicable Launch Date.   15\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) No Inference Against Author. Network and Affiliate each acknowledge that this Agreement was fully negotiated by the parties and, therefore, no provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted against any party because such party or its legal representative drafted such provision.   (g) No Third-Party Beneficiaries. The provisions of this Agreement are for the exclusive benefit of the parties hereto (including the Stations) and their permitted assigns, and no third party shall be a beneficiary of, or have any rights by virtue of, this Agreement.   (h) Headings. The titles, headings of the sections and defined terms in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not in any way affect the interpretation of this Agreement. Any reference in this Agreement to \"Section\" or an \"Exhibit\" shall, unless the context expressly requires otherwise, be a reference to \"Section\" in, or an \"Exhibit\" to, this Agreement. Forms of the word \"include\" mean \"including without limitation;\" and references to \"hereunder,\" \"herein,\" \"hereof,\" and the like, refer to this Agreement.   (i) Non-Recourse. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, it is expressly understood and agreed by the parties hereto that each and every representation, warranty, covenant, undertaking and agreement made in this Agreement was not made or intended to be made as a personal representation, undertaking, warranty, covenant, or agreement on the part of any individual, and any recourse, whether in common law, in equity, by statute or otherwise, against any individual is hereby forever waived and released.   (j) LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS OF REVENUES, OR DAMAGES TO OR LOSS OF PERSONAL PROPERTY) IN ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH A DEFAULT UNDER OR A BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT.   (k) Taxes. Network shall not be liable for, and Affiliate shall pay and hold harmless Network from, any federal, state or local taxes, surcharges, levies or any other charges which are based upon revenues derived by operations of Affiliate or each Station. Neither Affiliate nor Station shall be liable for, and Network shall pay and hold Affiliate and each Station harmless from, any federal, state or local taxes, surcharges, levies or any other charges which are based upon revenues derived by operations of Network.   16\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006\n\n\n\n\n\n(l) Right of First Refusal. In the event Network decides to offer any new television programming channels (the \"New Channels\"), then Affiliate shall have ninety (90) calendar days from Affiliate's receipt of Network's comprehensive business plan for such New Channels to determine whether Affiliate desires to enter into an agreement with respect to the New Channels. At the expiration of the ninety (90)-day period, Affiliate's right of first refusal shall expire. If, during said ninety (90)-day period, Affiliate notifies Network in writing of its desire to add the New Channels to this Agreement, then both parties shall work diligently together and in good faith to enter into an agreement within ninety (90) days of such notice to include the terms and conditions pursuant to which the New Channels may be distributed by Affiliate. If, having used good faith diligent efforts, Affiliate and Network have failed to enter into such an agreement within such ninety (90)-day period, then neither party shall have an obligation to continue such negotiations or enter into an agreement with respect to the New Channels.   (m) Matter Broadcast. Federal law and FCC regulations require Network to disclose to Affiliate, and the Stations to disclose to their audiences, the identity of any person or entity that has given anything of value to Network or anyone associated with the Service in exchange for the inclusion of a product, service, trademark, brand name, or other program material in the Service. Network agrees to disclose to Affiliate, in writing, the existence, source and nature of any payments or other consideration received in connection with the production of the Service. Such disclosure shall be made prior to the time such matter is broadcast, so that each Station can satisfy its disclosure obligations under federal law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, proper disclosure in the content of the Service will satisfy Network's disclosure obligations to Affiliate under this Section 13(m), provided Network agrees to provide full details to Affiliate immediately upon request.   (n) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will have the full force and effect of a fully- executed original. This Agreement may be executed by each or either party by delivering signed signature pages thereof to the other party by facsimile. Any party delivering an executed counterpart of this Agreement by facsimile shall also deliver to the other party an original executed counterpart of this Agreement, but the failure to do so does not affect the validity, enforceability or binding effect of this Agreement.

If a Station commences transmitting the Service on other than the first day of a calendar quarter, then the Affiliate Advertising Share for such quarter shall be further prorated based on the number of days in such quarter that such Station transmitted the Service. For purposes of this Exhibit D, The number of Digital Cable Subscriber Households shall be determined by the certified report supplied by each MVPD distributing the service, described in Section 7(a) of the body of this Agreement. In the event that such report is not received by Network with respect to each and every MVPD that carries the Service, then, for purposes of this Exhibit D, the number of Digital Cable Subscriber Households shall be determined as follows:    a.In the event that the total number of linear digital video subscribers served by an MVPD that distributes the Service is not broken out by DMAs in such MVPD's reported data, then, for purposes of this Exhibit D, the number of Digital Cable Subscriber Households for such non-reporting MVPD shall be equal to the product of (x) the number of TV Households receiving linear video services from such MVPD's systems that carry the Service in the pertinent DMA as set forth in a Nielsen report such as FOCUS multiplied by (y) the National Digital Cable Penetration Percentage most recently reported by such MVPD. The \"National Digital Cable Penetration Percentage\" shall be equal to the quotient of (i) the total number of subscribers to linear digital video services as most recently publicly reported by such MVPD, divided by (ii) the total number of TV Households receiving linear video services from such MVPD as most recently publicly reported by such MVPD.\n\n22\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006\n\n\n\n\n\n   b. In the event that a particular MVPD does not report its total number of subscribers to linear digital video services and total number of TV Households receiving linear video services, then, for purposes of this Exhibit D, the number of Digital Cable Subscriber Households for such non-reporting MVPD shall be equal to the product of (x) the number of TV Households receiving linear video services served by such MVPD's systems that carry the Service as set forth in a Nielsen report such as FOCUS multiplied by (y) a national digital cable penetration estimate from Kagan Research, LLC.    c. In the event that a more accurate independent publicly available source for determining the number of television households that receive the Service through a subscription cable service hereafter becomes available, the parties may mutually agree to use such source in lieu of the foregoing.   2.Payment. The Affiliate Advertising Share, if any, shall be payable quarterly and shall be due no later than forty-five (45) days following the end of each calendar quarter for which a payment is due. If this Agreement is terminated during a calendar quarter, the amount payable shall be determined as of the termination date.

Dated as of March 6, 2006   ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS   Music Rights and Copyright Indemnification   Without limiting Network's indemnification obligations as set forth in the body of this Agreement:   Network agrees to indemnify the Affiliate Indemnitees against any and all Costs arising out of any (i) third-party claims that Network's music performance rights licenses with ASCAP, BMI and SESAC (or directly with the applicable composer(s) and publisher(s)) do not cover music performances through to the viewers of the Service; and (ii) written agreement between Affiliate and an MVPD for the retransmission of the Service (together with the Primary Feed as provided in Section 3(a) of the body of the Agreement) solely within the Station's DMA, or where the Station's signal is deemed \"significantly viewed\" pursuant to FCC rules, pursuant to which Affiliate is obligated to indemnify such MVPD against any Incremental Copyright Cost (as defined below) resulting directly from the retransmission of the Service by such MVPD in the Station's DMA. For purposes hereof, \"Incremental Copyright Cost\" shall mean the difference, if any, between (A) the copyright royalties that would be payable by the MVPD in the Station's DMA without carriage of the Service, and (B) the copyright royalties that would be payable by such MVPD in such DMA with the carriage of the Service. Network hereby authorizes Affiliate to enter into such an agreement if, in Affiliate's reasonable and good faith judgment, such an agreement is necessary to obtain an MVPD's consent to carry the Service. For purposes of clarification, ASCAP, BMI and SESAC are and shall be considered \"third parties.\" Network represents and warrants that it has and throughout the Term will have a valid through- to-the-viewer music performance rights license with ASCAP and BMI (and any other society that may license such rights for music contained in the Service) (or directly with the applicable composer(s) and publisher(s)) covering all of the music contained in the Service. Network has commenced negotiations for a through-to-the-viewer music performance rights license with SESAC and expects to attain such license within a reasonable period of time.\n\n24\n\n\n\nSource: TUBE MEDIA CORP., 8-K, 3/10/2006"}]}, {"title": "MARSHALLHOLDINGSINTERNATIONAL,INC_04_14_2004-EX-10.15-ENDORSEMENT AGREEMENT", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "ENDORSEMENT AGREEMENT", "answer_start": 78}], "id": "MARSHALLHOLDINGSINTERNATIONAL,INC_04_14_2004-EX-10.15-ENDORSEMENT AGREEMENT__Document Name", "question": "The name of the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "CELEBRITY", "answer_start": 266}, {"text": "Bruce Jenner", "answer_start": 239}, {"text": "the COMPANY", "answer_start": 365}, {"text": "The Right Solution", "answer_start": 323}], "id": "MARSHALLHOLDINGSINTERNATIONAL,INC_04_14_2004-EX-10.15-ENDORSEMENT AGREEMENT__Parties", "question": "The two or more parties who signed the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "1st day of                                                                --- November, 2003", "answer_start": 131}], "id": "MARSHALLHOLDINGSINTERNATIONAL,INC_04_14_2004-EX-10.15-ENDORSEMENT AGREEMENT__Agreement Date", "question": "The date of the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [], "id": "MARSHALLHOLDINGSINTERNATIONAL,INC_04_14_2004-EX-10.15-ENDORSEMENT AGREEMENT__Effective Date", "question": "The date when the contract is effective\u00a0", "is_impossible": true}, {"answers": [{"text": "The COMPANY agrees to a one year engagement to contract the CELEBRITY to      speak at the company meetings and seminars along with endorsement of the      Company products.", "answer_start": 896}], "id": "MARSHALLHOLDINGSINTERNATIONAL,INC_04_14_2004-EX-10.15-ENDORSEMENT AGREEMENT__Expiration Date", "question": "On what date will the contract's initial term expire?", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [], "id": "MARSHALLHOLDINGSINTERNATIONAL,INC_04_14_2004-EX-10.15-ENDORSEMENT AGREEMENT__Renewal Term", "question": "What is the renewal term after the initial term expires?
