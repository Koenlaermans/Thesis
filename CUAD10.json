Suite 700 Washington, D.C. 20006\n\nLadies and Gentlemen:\n\n                  AFSALA  Bancorp,  Inc. (the  \"Company\") and Amsterdam  Federal Savings and Loan  Association,  a federally  chartered  mutual  savings and loan association  (\"Association\"),  with its deposit  accounts insured by the Savings Association   Insurance  Fund  (\"SAIF\")  administered  by  the  Federal  Deposit Insurance  Corporation  (\"FDIC\"),  hereby  confirm their  agreement with Capital Resources, Inc. (\"Capital Resources\") as follows:\n\n                  SECTION 1. The Offering.  The Association,  in accordance with and pursuant to its plan of conversion  adopted by the Board of Directors of the Association  (the \"Plan\"),  intends to be converted  from a  federally-chartered mutual savings and loan association to a federally-chartered  stock savings bank and will  sell all of its  issued  and  outstanding  stock to the  Company.  The Company  will  offer  and  sell its  common  stock  (the  \"Common  Stock\")  in a subscription  offering  (\"Subscription  Offering\") to (1) tax qualified employee benefit plans of the Association,  (2) depositors of the Association as of March 31, 1995 (\"Eligible Account  Holders\"),  (3) depositors of the Association as of June 30, 1996  (\"Supplemental  Eligible  Account  Holders\"),  (4) certain  other deposit  account  holders  and  borrower  members  of  the  Association  (\"Other Members\") and (5) to its employees,  officers and directors,  pursuant to rights to  subscribe  for shares of Common Stock (the  \"Shares\").  Subject to the prior subscription rights of the above-listed  parties, the Company may offer for sale in a public offering (the \"Public  Offering,\" and when referred to together with the Subscription  Offering,  the \"Subscription and Public Offerings\")  conducted after the Subscription  Offering, the Shares not so subscribed for or ordered in the  Subscription  Offering  to the  general  public  (all such  offerees  being referred to in the aggregate as \"Eligible Offerees\"). Shares may also be sold in the Public Offering by a selling group of  broker-dealers  organized and managed by Capital  Resources.  It is  acknowledged  that the  purchase of Shares in the Subscription  and Public  Offerings  is subject to maximum and minimum  purchase limitations as described in the Plan and that the Company may reject in whole or in part any subscriptions received from subscribers in the Public Offering.\n\n                  The  Company  and the  Association  desire to  retain  Capital Resources to assist the Company with its sale of the Shares in the  Subscription and Public  Offerings.  By and  through  this  Agreement,  the  Company  and the Association confirm the retention of Capital Resources to assist the Company and the Association during the Subscription and Public Offerings.\n\n                  The  Company  has  filed  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange Commission  (the  \"Commission\")  a registration  statement on Form S-l (File No. 333-6399)  containing an offering  prospectus  relating to the  Subscription and Public  Offerings for the registration of the Shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"1933 Act\"),  and has filed such  amendments  thereto,  if any, and such amended  prospectuses as may have been required to the date hereof (the  \"Registration  Statement\").  The prospectus,  as amended,  included in the Registration   Statement  at  the  time  it  initially  becomes  effective,   is hereinafter called the \"Offering  Prospectus\",  except that if any prospectus is filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the \"1933 Act Regulations\") differing from the offering  prospectus  included in the Registration  Statement at the time it initially becomes effective,  the term \"Offering  Prospectus\" shall refer to the offering prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) from and after the time said offering prospectus is filed with or mailed to the Commission for filing.\n\n                  In accordance  with Title 12, Part 563b of the Code of Federal Regulations (the \"Conversion  Regulations\"),  the Association has filed with the Office  of Thrift  Supervision  (the  \"OTS\")  an  Application  for  Approval  of Conversion  on Form AC (the  \"Conversion  Application\")  including  the Offering\n\n\n\n\n\nProspectus  and has filed  such  amendments  thereto,  if any,  as may have been required by the OTS. The  Conversion  Application  has been approved by the OTS. The Company has filed with the OTS its application on Form H-(e)lS (the \"Holding Company  Application\")  to acquire the  Association  under the Home Owners' Loan Act, as amended (12 U.S.C. ss. 1467a) (\"HOLA\").\n\n                  SECTION 2. Retention of Capital Resources;  Compensation; Sale and  Delivery  of the  Shares.  Subject to the terms and  conditions  herein set forth, the Company and the Association hereby appoint Capital Resources as their agent to advise and assist the Company and the  Association  with the  Company's sale of the Shares in the Subscription and Public Offerings.\n\n                  On  the  basis  of  the   representations,   warranties,   and agreements herein contained,  but subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, Capital Resources accepts such appointment and agrees to consult with and advise the Company and the Association as to matters  relating to the Conversion and the Subscription and Public Offerings. It is acknowledged by the Company and the  Association  that Capital  Resources  shall not be required to purchase any Shares and shall not be obligated to take any action which is inconsistent  with any  applicable  laws,  regulations,  decisions  or orders.  If requested by the Company or the  Association,  Capital  Resources  also may assemble and manage a selling group of broker dealers which are members of the National Association of Securities  Dealers,  Inc. (the \"NASD\") to  participate in the  solicitation  of purchase  orders  for  Shares  under a selected  dealers'  agreement  (\"Selected Dealers'  Agreement\").  The  obligations of Capital  Resources  pursuant to this Agreement  shall  terminate upon the completion or termination or abandonment of the  Plan  by  the  Company  or  the  Association  or  upon  termination  of the Subscription  and  Public  Offerings,  or if the  terms  of the  Conversion  are substantially  amended  so as to  materially  and  adversely  change the role of Capital  Resources,  but in no event later than 45 days after the  completion of the Subscription and Public Offerings (the \"End Date\").  All fees due to Capital Resources  but unpaid will be payable to Capital  Resources in next day funds at the earlier of the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) or the End Date.

The  activities of the  Association as described  in the  Offering  Prospectus,  insofar  as they are  material  to the operations  and  financial  condition of the  Association,  are permitted by the rules,  regulations and resolutions and practices of the OTS or the FDIC and any other federal or state authorities.\n\n                  (iv)  The  Association  is a  member  of the  FHLBNY,  and the deposit  accounts of the  Association  are insured by the FDIC up to the maximum amount  allowed  under  law  and to the  best  of such  counsel's  knowledge  no proceedings  for the  termination or revocation of such insurance are pending or threatened;  and the description of the liquidation  account as set forth in the Registration  Statement  and the  Offering  Prospectus  under the  caption  \"The Conversion - Effects of Conversion to Stock Form on Depositors  and Borrowers of the  Bank -  Liquidation  Account\"  has been  reviewed  by such  counsel  and is accurate in all material respects.\n\n                  (v)  Upon  consummation  of the  Conversion,  the  authorized, issued and outstanding  capital stock of the Company will be as set forth in the Registration   Statement   and  the  Offering   Prospectus   under  the  caption \"Capitalization,\"  and no shares of Common  Stock have been issued  prior to the Closing Date; at the time of the Conversion,  the Shares subscribed for pursuant to the Offerings will have been duly and validly  authorized  for issuance,  and when issued and delivered by the Company pursuant to the Plan against payment of\n\n\n\n\n\nthe consideration  calculated as set forth in the Plan, will be duly and validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable;  and the issuance of the Shares is not subject to preemptive rights.\n\n                  (vi)  The  issuance  and  sale  of  the  common  stock  of the Association  to the  Company  have  been  duly  and  validly  authorized  by all necessary  corporate  action on the part of the Company and the Association and, upon payment  therefor in accordance  with the terms of the Plan of  Conversion, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and will be owned of  record  by the  Company,  free and  clear  of any  mortgage,  pledge,  lien, encumbrance or claim (legal or equitable).\n\n                  (vii) The  execution  and delivery of this  Agreement  and the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized  by  all  necessary  action  on  the  part  of the  Company  and  the Association; and this Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of the Company and the  Association,  enforceable  in accordance  with its terms (except as the enforceability  thereof may be limited by  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  moratorium, reorganization  or similar laws  relating to or  affecting  the  enforcement  of creditors'  rights generally or the rights of creditors of savings  associations or savings and loan holding  companies,  the accounts of whose  subsidiaries are insured by the FDIC or by general equity principles,  regardless of whether such enforceability  is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law, and except to the  extent,  if any,  that the  provisions  of  Sections 9 and 10 hereof may be unenforceable as against public policy).\n\n                  (viii) The Plan has been duly adopted by the required  vote of the Directors of the Company and the Association and members of the Association.\n\n                                      -16-\n\n                  (ix)  Subject to the  satisfaction  of the  conditions  to the OTS's approval of the  Conversion  and the Company's  application to acquire the Association, no further approval, registration,  authorization, consent or other order of any regulatory  agency,  public board or body is required in connection with the  execution and delivery of this  Agreement,  the issuance of the Shares and the  consummation  of the  Conversion,  except as may be required  under the regulations of the NASD and the NASDAQ National Market.

The OTS has issued its order of  approval  under the savings and loan holding company provisions of the HOLA, and the purchase by the Company of all of the issued and  outstanding  capital stock of the  Association has been  authorized  by the OTS and no action has been taken,  or to  counsel's knowledge  is  pending  or  threatened,  to  revoke  any such  authorization  or approval.\n\n                  (xi) The  Registration  Statement is effective  under the 1933 Act and no stop order  suspending  the  effectiveness  has been issued under the 1933  Act  or  proceedings   therefor  initiated  or,  to  counsel's  knowledge, threatened by the Commission.\n\n                  (xii) At the time the  Conversion  Application,  including the Offering Prospectus contained therein, was approved,  the Conversion Application including the Offering Prospectus contained therein (as amended or supplemented, if so amended or supplemented) complied as to form in all material respects with the  requirements  of all  applicable  federal laws and the rules,  regulations, decisions  and orders of the OTS (except as to the financial  statements,  other financial data and stock valuation information included therein as to which such counsel need express no opinion); to the best of such counsel's knowledge, based on  conferences  with  management  of and the  independent  accountants  for the Company and the Association,  and on such investigation of the corporate records of the Company and the Association as such counsel  conducted in connection with the preparation of the  Registration  Statement and the Conversion  Application, all material  documents  and exhibits  required to be filed with the  Conversion Application (as amended or  supplemented,  if so amended or  supplemented)  have been so filed.  The  description in the Conversion  Application and the Offering Prospectus  contained  therein of such documents and exhibits is accurate in all material respects and fairly presents the information required to be shown.\n\n                  (xiii)  At the time  that the  Registration  Statement  became effective,  (i) the  Registration  Statement (as amended or  supplemented  if so amended  or  supplemented)  (other  than  the  financial  statements  and  other financial and statistical data and stock valuation information included therein, as to which no opinion  need be  rendered),  complied as to form in all material respects with the  requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations and (ii) the Offering  Prospectus  (other than the  financial  statements  and other financial and  statistical  data and the stock  valuation  information  included therein,  as to which no opinion  need be  rendered)  complied as to form in all material  respects  with  the  requirements  of  the  1933  Act,  the  1933  Act Regulations,  Conversion Regulations and Federal and State law (other than state blue sky law as to which we express no opinion).  To the best of such  counsel's knowledge based on the conferences and document review  specified in item (xiii) above,  all  material  documents  and  exhibits  required  to be filed  with the Registration   Statement  (as  amended  or   supplemented,   if  so  amended  or supplemented) have been so filed. The description in the Registration  Statement and the Offering  Prospectus  of such  documents and exhibits is accurate in all\n\n\n\n\n\nmaterial respects and fairly\n\n                                      -17-\n\npresents the  information  required to be shown.  To the best of such  counsel's knowledge,  no person has sought to obtain  regulatory or judicial review of the final action of the OTS approving the Conversion Application or in approving the Holding Company Application.\n\n                  (xiv) During the course of such  counsel's  representation  of the Company and the  Association,  nothing has come to such counsel's  attention that  caused it to believe  that (i) the Company  and the  Association  have not conducted the  Conversion,  in all material  respects,  in  accordance  with all applicable  requirements  of the Plan and applicable law, and (ii) the Plan, the Conversion  Application,  the Registration Statement and the Offering Prospectus (other than the financial  statements and other financial and  statistical  data and the stock valuation information included therein as to which no opinion need be rendered) do not comply in all material  respects with all  applicable  laws, rules,  regulations,  decisions  and orders  including,  but not limited to, the Conversion Regulations,  the HOLA, the 1933 Act and 1933 Act Regulations and all other  applicable  laws,  regulations,   decisions  and  orders,  including  all applicable  terms,  conditions,  requirements  and  provisions  precedent to the Conversion imposed upon it by the OTS, the Commission and the FDIC, if any.\n\n                  (xv) The  terms  and  provisions  of the  Common  Stock of the Company  conform  to the  description  thereof  contained  in  the  Registration Statement  and the Offering  Prospectus,  and the form of  certificates  used to evidence the Shares are in due and proper form.\n\n                  (xvi) To the best  knowledge  of such  counsel,  there  are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened which are required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Offering Prospectus,  other than those disclosed therein,  and all pending legal and governmental  proceedings to which  the  Company  or the  Association  is a party  or of  which  any of their property is the subject  which are not described in the  Registration  Statement and the Offering Prospectus, including ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, are, considered in the aggregate, not material;  provided that for this purpose, any litigation or governmental  proceeding is not considered to be \"threatened\"  unless  the  potential  litigant  or  governmental  authority  has manifested  to the  management  of the  Company or the  Association,  or to such counsel, a present intention to initiate such litigation or proceeding.\n\n                  (xvii) To the best knowledge of such counsel,  the Company and the  Association  have  obtained all  licenses,  permits and other  governmental authorizations  required for the conduct of their respective businesses,  except where the failure to have such  licenses,  permits or  authorizations  would not have a material adverse effect on the business, operations or income or business prospects of the Company and the Association, and all such licenses, permits and other governmental  authorizations are in full force and effect, and the Company and the Association are in all material respects complying therewith.\n\n                  (xviii)   Neither  the  Company  nor  the  Association  is  in contravention of its certificate of incorporation or its charter,  respectively, or its bylaws (and the Association  will not be in  contravention of its charter or bylaws in stock form upon  consummation  of the  Conversion)  or, to the best knowledge  of such  counsel,  in  contravention  of any  obligation,  agreement, covenant or condition contained in any material contract,  indenture,  mortgage, loan  agreement,  note,  lease or other  instrument to which it is a party or by which it or its property may be bound which  contravention  would be material to the business of the Company and the  Association  considered as one  enterprise; the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the Association, the incurring of the  obligations  herein set forth and the  consummation of the transactions contemplated herein have been duly authorized by all necessary\n\n                                      -18-\n\ncorporate action of the Company and the Association,  and, to the best knowledge of such counsel,  will not constitute a material breach of, or default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any material lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or the Association which are material to their  business  considered  as one  enterprise,  pursuant  to any  contract, indenture,  mortgage,  loan agreement,  note, lease or other instrument to which the Company or the  Association is a party or by which any of them may be bound, or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or the  Association  is subject.  In addition,  such action will not result in any  contravention of the provisions of the certificate of  incorporation  or bylaws of the Company or the Association  or any  applicable  law,  act,  regulation or order or court order, writ,  injunction or decree.  The charter of the  Association  in stock form has been approved by the OTS.\n\n                  (xix) To the best  knowledge of such counsel,  the Company and the  Association  have good and  marketable  title to all  properties and assets described in the Registration  Statement as owned by them, free and clear of all liens,  charges,  encumbrances or restrictions,  except such as are described in the  Registration  Statement  or are not material in relation to the business of the Company and the Association considered as one enterprise; and to the best of such  counsel's  knowledge,  all of the leases  and  subleases  material  to the business  of the  Company  and the  Association  under which the Company and the\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociation hold properties,  as described in the Registration Statement, are in full force and effect.\n\n                  (xx) The Company and the  Association  are not in violation of any directive from the OTS or the FDIC to make any material change in the method of conducting  their business and the Company and the Association have conducted and are conducting their business so as to comply in all material  respects with all  applicable  statutes  and  regulations   (including,   without  limitation, regulations, decisions, directives and orders of the OTS and the FDIC).\n\n                  (xxi)  The  information  in  the  Registration  Statement  and Offering Prospectus under the captions  \"Regulation,\"  \"Certain  Restrictions on Acquisitions of the Company,\" \"The  Conversion,\"  \"Description of Capital Stock\" and the  information  in response to Items 7(d)(l),  7(f),  7(g) and 7(i) of the Form PS of the Conversion Regulations, to the extent that it constitutes matters of  law,  summaries  of  legal  matters,  documents  or  proceedings,  or  legal conclusions,  has been  reviewed by such  counsel and is correct in all material respects  (except  as to the  financial  statements  and  other  financial  data included therein as to which such counsel need express no opinion).\n\n                  In  rendering  such  opinion,  such counsel may rely (A) as to matters  involving the  application of laws of any  jurisdiction  other than the United  States,  to the extent such counsel  deems proper and  specified in such opinion satisfactory to Capital Resources,  upon the opinion of other counsel of good  standing  (providing  that such counsel  states that Capital  Resources is justified in relying upon such  specified  opinion or  opinions),  and (B) as to matters of fact,  to the extent such counsel deems proper,  on  certificates  of responsible  officers of the Company and the  Association  and public  officials (but not on  conclusions  of law which  may be set forth in said  certificates); provided copies of any such opinion(s) or  certificates  are delivered  pursuant hereto  or to  Capital  Resources  together  with  the  opinion  to be  rendered hereunder by special  counsel to the Company and the  Association.  Such counsel may assume that any agreement is the valid and binding obligation of any parties to such agreement other than the Company or the Association.\n\n                  (2) The  letter  of  Malizia,  Spidi,  Sloane &  Fisch,  P.C., counsel for the  Company and the  Association  addressed  to Capital  Resources, dated the Closing Date, in form and substance to the effect that:\n\n                                      -19-\n\n                  During the  preparation  of the  Conversion  Application,  the Registration Statement and the Offering Prospectus, such counsel participated in conferences with management of, and the independent  public  accountants for the Company  and the  Association.  Based  upon  such  conferences  and a review  of corporate  records of the Company and the Association as such counsel  conducted in connection with the preparation of the Registration  Statement and Conversion Application, nothing has come to their attention that would lead them to believe that the  Conversion  Application,  the  Registration  Statement,  the  Offering Prospectus,  or any  amendment or supplement  thereto  (other than the financial statements  and  other  financial  and  statistical  data  and  stock  valuation information  included  therein,  as to which such counsel need express no view), contained an untrue  statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements  therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.\n\n                  (3) The  favorable  opinion,  dated as of the Closing Date, of Serchuk &  Zelermyer,  LLP,  Capital  Resources'  counsel,  with respect to such matters as Capital Resources may reasonably require.  Such opinion may rely upon the opinions of counsel to the Company and the Association, and as to matters of fact,  upon  certificates  of  officers  and  directors  of the  Company and the Association  delivered  pursuant  hereto  or as such  counsel  shall  reasonably request.\n\n                  (d) At the Closing Date,  counsel to Capital  Resources  shall have been  furnished  with such  documents  and opinions as they may  reasonably require  for the  purpose  of  enabling  them to render  the  opinion  as herein contemplated  and related  proceedings or in order to evidence the occurrence or completeness of any of the representations or warranties,  or the fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained.\n\n                  (e) At the Closing  Date,  Capital  Resources  shall receive a certificate of the Chief Executive  Officer and the Chief  Financial  Officer of the Company and of the Chief Executive  Officer and Chief  Financial  Officer of the  Association,  dated as of such Closing Date,  to the effect that:  (i) they have carefully  examined the Offering  Prospectus and, in their opinion,  at the time the  Offering  Prospectus  became  authorized  for final use,  the Offering Prospectus  did not contain an untrue  statement  of a material  fact or omit to state a material  fact  necessary in order to make the  statements  therein,  in light of the  circumstances  under which they were made,  not  misleading;  (ii) since the date the Offering Prospectus became authorized for final use, in their opinion no event has  occurred  which should have been set forth in an amendment or  supplement  to the  Offering  Prospectus  which  has not been so set  forth, including specifically,  but without limitation,  any material adverse change in the condition,  financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, capital, properties, business  prospects or business affairs of the Company or the  Association,  and the conditions set forth in this Section 8 have been satisfied;  (iii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration  Statement and the Offering  Prospectus,  there has been no material  adverse change in the condition,  financial or  otherwise,  or in the earnings,  capital,  properties, business  affairs or  business  prospects  of the  Company  or the  Association,\n\n\n\n\n\nindependently,  or  of  the  Company  and  the  Association  considered  as  one enterprise,  whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business;  (iv) to the best  knowledge  of such  officers the  representations  and  warranties  in Section  4 are true  and  correct  with the same  force  and  effect  as  though expressly  made  at and  as of  the  Closing  Date;  (v)  the  Company  and  the Association  have complied with all material  agreements and  satisfied,  in all material  respects at or prior to the Closing Date, all obligations  required to be met by  such  date  and  will  in  all  material  respects  comply  with  all obligations  to be  satisfied  by them  after  Conversion;  (vi)  no stop  order suspending the  effectiveness of the  Registration  Statement has been initiated or, to the best  knowledge  of the  Company or  Association,  threatened  by the Commission or any state authority; (vii) no order suspending the Subscription or Public Offerings, the Conversion, the\n\n                                      -20-\n\nacquisition  of all of the  shares  of the  Association  by the  Company  or the effectiveness  of the  Offering  Prospectus  has  been  issued  and to the  best knowledge of the Company or  Association,  no proceedings  for that purpose have been initiated or threatened by the OTS, the Commission,  the FDIC, or any state authority;  and (viii) to the best of their  knowledge,  no person has sought to obtain review of the final action of the OTS approving the Plan.\n\n                  (f) Prior to and at the Closing  Date:  (i) in the  reasonable opinion of Capital  Resources,  there shall have been no material adverse change in the condition,  financial or otherwise,  or in the earnings,  or the business affairs or business  prospects of the Company or the Association  independently, or of the Company or the  Association,  considered as one enterprise,  since the latest dates as of which such condition is set forth in the Offering Prospectus, except  as  referred  to  therein;  (ii)  there  shall  have  been  no  material transaction  entered into by the Company or the Association from the latest date as of which the  financial  condition of the Company or the  Association  is set forth  in  the  Offering  Prospectus  other  than  transactions  referred  to or contemplated  therein;  (iii)  the  Company  or the  Association  shall not have received  from the OTS or the FDIC any  direction  (oral or written) to make any material change in the method of conducting their business with which it has not complied  (which  direction,  if any,  shall  have  been  disclosed  to  Capital Resources) and which would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the  business,  operations  or  financial  condition  or income of the Company or the  Association  taken as a whole;  (iv) neither the Company nor the Association  shall have been in default (nor shall an event have occurred which, with  notice or lapse of time or both,  would  constitute  a default)  under any provision of and  agreement or instrument  relating to any material  outstanding indebtedness;  (v) no action, suit or proceedings, at law or in equity or before or by any federal or state  commission,  board or other  administrative  agency, shall be  pending,  or, to the  knowledge  of the  Company  or the  Association, threatened  against the Company or the  Association  or  affecting  any of their properties wherein an unfavorable  decision,  ruling or finding would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse  effect on the business,  operations, financial  condition  or income of the  Company or the  Association,  taken as a whole;  and (vi) the Shares have been  qualified or registered  for offering and sale  under the  securities  or blue sky laws of the  jurisdictions  as  Capital Resources shall have requested and as agreed to by the Company.\n\n                  (g) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Capital Resources shall receive a letter from KPMG,  dated the date hereof and addressed to Capital  Resources:  (i) confirming that KPMG is a firm of independent public accountants  within the meaning of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations and 12 C.F.R. ss. 571.2(c)(3) and no information concerning its relationship with or interests in the Company and the  Association is required to be disclosed in the Offering Prospectus by the Conversion Regulations or Item 10 of the Registration Statement, and stating in effect that in KPMG's opinion the financial statements of the Association as are included in the Offering  Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the 1933 Act and the related published rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and the Conversion  Regulations and generally  accepted  accounting  principles; (ii) stating in effect that, on the basis of certain agreed upon procedures (but not  an  audit  examination  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing standards)  consisting of a reading of the latest  available  unaudited  interim financial statements of the Association  prepared by the Association,  a reading of the  minutes of the  meetings  of the Board of  Directors  and members of the Association and consultations  with officers of the Association  responsible for financial and accounting  matters,  nothing came to their attention which caused them to  believe  that:  (A)  such  unaudited  financial  statements  are not in conformity  with generally  accepted  accounting  principles  applied on a basis substantially  consistent with that of the audited financial statements included in the Offering Prospectus;

Any  certificates  signed by an  officer or  director  of the Company or the  Association  and  delivered to Capital  Resources or its counsel shall be deemed a representation  and warranty by the Company or the Association to Capital Resources as to the statements made therein.\n\n                  If any of the  conditions  specified in this Section shall not have been fulfilled when and as required by this  Agreement,  this Agreement and all of Capital  Resources'  obligations  hereunder  may be  canceled  by Capital Resources by notifying the  Association  of such  cancellation  in writing or by telegram at any time at or prior to the Closing Date, and any such  cancellation shall be without  liability  of any party to any other party except as otherwise provided in Sections 2, 7, 9 and 10 hereof.  Notwithstanding  the above, if this\n\n\n\n\n\nAgreement  is  canceled  pursuant  to  this  paragraph,   the  Company  and  the Association  jointly and severally agree to reimburse  Capital Resources for all out-of-pocket  expenses,  (including without limitation the fees and expenses of Capital Resources' counsel) reasonably incurred by Capital Resources and Capital Resources'  counsel at its normal rates,  in connection  with the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Offering Prospectus,  and in contemplation of the proposed  Subscription  or Public  Offerings  to the extent  provided for in Sections 2 and 7 hereof.\n\n                  SECTION 9.  Indemnification.\n\n                  (a) The Company  and the  Association  jointly  and  severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless Capital Resources, its officers, directors, agents and  employees  and each person,  if any, who controls or is under common control with Capital  Resources within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act,  against any and all loss,  liability,  claim, damage or expense whatsoever (including but not limited to settlement expenses), joint or several,  that Capital  Resources or any of them may suffer or to which Capital  Resources  and any such persons  upon  written  demand for any expenses (including fees and  disbursements of counsel)  incurred by Capital Resources or any of them  in  connection  with  investigating,  preparing  or  defending  any actions,  proceedings or claims (whether  commenced or threatened) to the extent such losses,  claims,  damages,  liabilities  or actions (i) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material\n\n                                      -23-\n\nfact  contained in the  Registration  Statement  (or any amendment or supplement thereto),  preliminary  or  final  Offering  Prospectus  (or  any  amendment  or supplement thereto),  the Conversion  Application or any Blue Sky application or other  instrument  or document of the Company or the  Association  or based upon written  information  supplied  by the Company or the  Association  filed in any state or  jurisdiction  to  register  or qualify any or all of the Shares or the subscription  rights  applicable  thereto  under  the  securities  laws  thereof (collectively,  the  \"Blue  Sky  Application\"),  or  any  application  or  other document,  advertisement, oral statement, or communication (\"Sales Information\") prepared,  made or executed  by or on behalf of the Company  with its consent or based upon written or oral information  furnished by or on behalf of the Company or the Association, whether or not filed in any jurisdiction in order to qualify or register the Shares under the securities  laws thereof;  (ii) arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in any of the foregoing documents  or  information,  a material  fact  required to be stated  therein or necessary to make the statements  therein,  in light of the circumstances  under which  they were  made,  not  misleading;  or,  (iii)  arise  from any theory of liability  whatsoever relating to or arising from or based upon the Registration Statement  (or any  amendment  or  supplement  thereto),  preliminary  or  final Offering  Prospectus  (or any amendment or supplement  thereto),  the Conversion Application,   any  Blue  Sky   Application   or  Sales   Information  or  other documentation distributed in connection with the Conversion;  provided, however, that no  indemnification is required under this paragraph (a) to the extent such losses, claims,  damages,  liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue  material  statements or alleged  untrue  material  statements in, or material omission or alleged material omission from, the Registration  Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Conversion  Application,  any Blue Sky Application,  the preliminary or final Offering Prospectus (or any amendment or  supplement  thereto),  or Sales  Information  made in  reliance  upon and in conformity with written information  furnished to the Company or the Association by Capital Resources  regarding  Capital  Resources  expressly for use under the caption \"The Conversion - Marketing Arrangements\" in the Offering Prospectus nor is  indemnification  required for material  oral  misstatements  made by Capital Resources,  which are not based upon information  provided by the Association or the  Company  orally or in  writing  or based on  information  contained  in the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto),  preliminary or final  Offering  Prospectus  (or  any  amendment  or  supplement  thereto),  the Conversion   Application,   any  Blue  Sky  Application  or  Sales   Information distributed in connection with the Conversion.\n\n                  (b) Capital  Resources  agrees to indemnify  and hold harmless the Company and the Association,  their directors and officers, agents, servants and  employees  and  each  person,  if any,  who  controls  the  Company  or the Association within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act  against  any and all loss,  liability,  claim,  damage or  expense whatsoever (including but not limited to settlement expenses),  joint or several which they,  or any of them,  may suffer or to which they,  or any of them,  may become subject under all applicable federal and state laws or otherwise,  and to promptly  reimburse  the  Company,  the  Association  and any such  persons upon written demand for any expenses  (including fees and  disbursements  of counsel) incurred by them, or any of them, in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any actions,  proceedings or claims (whether  commenced or threatened) to the extent such losses, claims, damages,  liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact  contained in the  Registration  Statement  (or any amendment of supplement thereto),  or the preliminary or final Offering  Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto),  or the Conversion  Application or any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in any of the foregoing  documents a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements  therein,  in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,  not  misleading;  provided,  however,  that Capital Resources  obligations  under this  Section 9(b) shall exist only if and only to the\n\n                                      -24-\n\n\n\n\n\nextent that such untrue  statement or alleged  untrue  statement was made in, or such material fact or alleged  material fact was omitted from, the  Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement  thereto),  the  preliminary  or final Offering Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto),  or the Conversion Application,  any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information in reliance upon and in  conformity  with  written  information  furnished  to  the  Company  or  the Association by Capital Resources  regarding Capital Resources  expressly for use under the caption  \"The  Conversion  - Marketing  Arrangements\"  in the Offering Prospectus  or in the event of oral  misstatements  made by  Capital  Resources, which are not based upon information  provided by the Association or the Company orally or in  writing  or based on  information  contained  in the  Registration Statement  (or any  amendment  or  supplement  thereto),  preliminary  or  final Offering  Prospectus  (or any amendment or supplement  thereto),  the Conversion Application,  any  Blue Sky  Application  or Sales  Information  distributed  in connection with the Conversion.\n\n                  (c) Each indemnified party shall give prompt written notice to each indemnifying party of any action,  proceeding,  claim (whether commenced or threatened),  or suit instituted against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought  hereunder,  but  failure to so notify an  indemnifying  party  shall not relieve it from any liability  which it may have on account of this Section 9 or otherwise.  An  indemnifying  party may  participate  at its own  expense in the defense of such action.  In addition,  if it so elects within a reasonable  time after  receipt of such notice,  an  indemnifying  party,  jointly with any other indemnifying  parties  receiving such notice,  may assume defense of such action with  counsel  chosen by it and  approved by the  indemnified  parties  that are defendants in such action,  unless such indemnified parties reasonably object to such assumption on the ground that there may be legal defenses available to them that are different from or in addition to those  available to such  indemnifying party.  If an  indemnifying  party  assumes  the  defense  of such  action,  the indemnifying  parties  shall not be liable for any fees and  expenses of counsel for the indemnified  parties incurred thereafter in connection with such action, proceeding or claim,  other than reasonable costs of investigation.  In no event shall the indemnifying  parties be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one  separate  firm of  attorneys  (and any special  counsel  that said firm may retain)  for  all  indemnified  parties  in  connection  with  any  one  action, proceeding or claim or separate but similar or related  actions,  proceedings or claims in the same jurisdiction  arising out of the same general  allegations or circumstances.\n\n                  (d) The agreements  contained in this Section 9 and in Section 10  hereof  and  the  representations  and  warranties  of the  Company  and the Association set forth in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of: (i) any investigation  made by or on behalf of Capital Resources or its officers, directors or controlling persons, agents or employees or by or on behalf of the Company or the Association or any officers,  directors or controlling persons, agents or employees of the Company or the Association or any controlling  person,  director or officer of the Company or the Association; (ii) delivery of and payment  hereunder for the Shares; or (iii) any termination of this Agreement.\n\n                  (e) No  indemnification  by the Association under Section 9(a) hereof nor  contribution  under Section 10 hereof shall be effective if the same shall be deemed to be in violation of any law, rule or regulation  applicable to the  Association  including,  without  limitation,  Section  23A of the  Federal Reserve Act. If the  indemnification  or  contribution by the Association is not effective  pursuant  to the  preceding  sentence,  then the  indemnification  by Capital  Resources  pursuant to Section 9(b) shall be given only to the Company, its  directors  and  officers,  agents,  servants and  employees  and not to the Association,  its directors and officers, agents, servants and employees and the Association  shall not be entitled to any  contribution  from Capital  Resources pursuant to Section 10.\n\n                                      -25-\n\n                  SECTION  10.  Contribution.  In order to provide  for just and equitable  contribution in circumstances in which the  indemnification  provided for in  Section 9 is due in  accordance  with its  terms  but is for any  reason unavailable  as a result of  Section  9(e) or held by a court to be  unavailable from the  Company,  the  Association  or Capital  Resources,  the  Company,  the Association  and Capital  Resources  shall  contribute to the aggregate  losses, claims,  damages and liabilities  (including any investigation,  legal and other expenses  incurred in connection  with, and any amount paid in settlement of any action,  suit or  proceeding  of any claims  asserted,  but after  deducting any contribution  received by the Company or the  Association  or Capital  Resources from  persons  other than the other  party  thereto,  who may also be liable for contribution)  in such  proportion so that Capital  Resources is responsible for that  portion  represented  by the  percentage  that  the fees  paid to  Capital Resources pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement (not including expenses) bears to the gross proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the Shares in the Subscription and Public  Offerings and the Company and the Association  shall be responsible for the balance.  If, however,  the allocation provided above is not permitted  by  applicable  law or if the  indemnified  party  failed to give the notice  required  under  Section 9 above,  then each  indemnifying  party  shall contribute  to such  amount  paid or payable by such  indemnified  party in such proportion  as is  appropriate  to reflect not only such  relative  fault of the Company and the  Association on the one hand and Capital  Resources on the other\n\n\n\n\n\nin connection  with the  statements or omissions  which resulted in such losses, claims,  damages or  liabilities  (or actions,  proceedings or claims in respect thereof), but also the relative benefits received by the Company and Association on the one hand and Capital  Resources on the other from the offering as well as any other relevant equitable  considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company and the  Association  on the one hand and Capital  Resources  on the other shall be deemed to be in the same  proportion as the total gross  proceeds from the Subscription and Public Offerings (before deducting  expenses) received by the  Company  bear to the total fees (not  including  expenses)  received  by Capital Resources. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things,  whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the  omission  or  alleged  omission  to state a  material  fact  relates  to information  supplied by the Company  and/or the  Association on the one hand or Capital  Resources on the other and the parties'  relative  intent,  good faith, knowledge,  access to  information  and  opportunity  to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company, the Association and Capital Resources agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10 were  determined by pro rata  allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 10. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified  party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or action,  proceedings or claims in  respect  thereof)  referred  to above in this  Section 10 shall be deemed to include any legal or other  expenses  reasonably  incurred  by such  indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action,  proceeding or claim. It is expressly agreed that Capital  Resources shall not be liable for any loss,  liability,  claim, damage or expense or be required to contribute any amount which in the aggregate  exceeds the amount paid  (excluding  reimbursable expenses) to Capital  Resources under this Agreement.  It is understood that the above-stated  limitation on Capital Resources' liability is essential to Capital Resources and that Capital  Resources  relied upon such limitation and would not have entered into this  Agreement if such  limitation  had not been agreed to by the  parties  to this  Agreement.  No  person  found  guilty  of any  fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled  to  contribution  from any  person  who was not  found  guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Company and the Association under this Section 10 and under  Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company and the  Association  may otherwise have. For purposes of this Section 10,  each of Capital  Resources',  the  Company's  or the  Association's officers and directors and each person,  if any, who controls Capital  Resources or the  Company or the  Association  within the  meaning of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act shall  have the same  rights to  contribution  as the  Company  and the Association.\n\n                                      -26-\n\nAny  party  entitled  to  contribution,  promptly  after  receipt  of  notice of commencement  of any action,  suit,  claim or  proceeding  against such party in respect of which a claim for  contribution  may be made  against  another  party under this  Section 10, will  notify  such party from whom  contribution  may be sought,  but the  omission  to so notify  such party shall not relieve the party from whom  contribution  may be sought  from any  other  obligation  it may have hereunder or otherwise than under this Section 10.\n\n                  SECTION  11.  Survival  of  Agreements,   Representations  and Indemnities.  The respective  indemnities of the Company,  the  Association  and Capital Resources and the representations and warranties and other statements of the Company and the  Association set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement shall  remain  in full  force  and  effect,  regardless  of any  termination  or cancellation  of this  Agreement  or any  investigation  made by or on behalf of Capital  Resources,  the Company,  the  Association  or any  indemnified  person referred to in Section 9 hereof,  and shall  survive the issuance of the Shares, and any legal  representative,  successor  or assign of Capital  Resources,  the Association, and any such indemnified person shall be entitled to the benefit of the respective agreements, indemnities, warranties and representations.\n\n                  SECTION 12.  Termination.  Capital Resources may terminate  this Agreement by giving the notice indicated below in this Section at any time after this Agreement becomes effective as follows:\n\n                  (a) In the event the  Company  fails to sell all of the Shares within the period  specified,  and in accordance with the provisions of the Plan or as required by the Conversion  Regulations and applicable law, this Agreement shall terminate upon refund by the Association to each person who has subscribed for or ordered any of the Shares the full amount which it may have received from such person, together with interest as provided in the Offering Prospectus,  and no party to this  Agreement  shall have any  obligation to the other  hereunder, except  for  payment  by the  Association  and/or  the  Company  as set forth in Sections 2, 7, 9 and 10 hereof.\n\n                  (b) If any of the conditions  specified in Section 8 shall not have been  fulfilled when and as required by this  Agreement,  or by the Closing Date,  or waived in writing  by Capital  Resources,  this  Agreement  and all of Capital Resources  obligations hereunder may be canceled by Capital Resources by notifying the Association of such  cancellation in writing or by telegram at any time at or prior to the  Closing  Date,  and,  any  such  cancellation  shall be without  Liability of any party to any other party except as otherwise  provided in Sections 2, 7, 9 and 10 hereof.\n\n                  (c) If Capital Resources elects to terminate this Agreement as provided in this section,  the Company and the Association  shall be notified as provided in Section 13 hereof,  promptly by Capital  Resources  by  telephone or telegram, confirmed by letter.\n\n\n\n\n\n               SECTION  13.

(\"Tripath\"), and\n\nUniquest Corporation 780 Montague Expressway Suite 406 Santa Jose, CA 95131\n\nTripath and Distributor intend to establish Distributor as a non-exclusive Distributor for Tripath products in the following designated Territory, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\n\nKorea\n\n1. Products\n\n1.1 \"Products\" means the Tripath semiconductor products identified by Tripath in writing from time to time.\n\n1.2 Tripath may discontinue manufacture or sale, or otherwise treat as obsolete, any or all of the Products covered by this Agreement upon thirty days written notice.\n\n2. Appointment and Term\n\n2.1 For the term of this Agreement, Tripath appoints Distributor as a non-exclusive distributor for the Products in the Territory, subject to Tripath's direct sales activities under Section 4.\n\n2.2 Distributor will use best efforts to develop the local market and promote the sales of Products within the Territory. Distributor will not sell outside the Territory without Tripath's prior written permission, which will not be unreasonably withheld.\n\n2.3 After one month's written notice, Tripath may in its discretion amend (i) the Products, and/or (ii) the Territory.\n\n2.4 Tripath reserves the right to appoint other distributors in or out of the Territory who may sell into the Territory.\n\n2.5 Distributor's appointment is for a term of one year from the Effective Date, renewable automatically unless terminated under Section 18\n\n3. Distributor Responsibilities\n\n3.1 Distributor will maintain an adequately trained sales organization, capable of fulfilling its obligation under Subsection 2.2.\n\n3.2 Tripath will furnish technical and marketing information (such as sales aids and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistributor Agreement\n\nliterature, data sheets, application notes, etc.) for the Products, and Distributor will maintain an organized and well stocked collection of such technical and marketing information for distribution to prospective customers.\n\n3.3 Distributor will employ sufficient trained personnel (\"Application Engineers\") to provide technical and marketing support for Tripath's Products. Distributor and Tripath will cooperate to ensure that the Application Engineers are and remain adequately trained and qualified.\n\n3.4 Distributor will maintain a reasonable number of Demonstration Products (customer samples), with appropriate technical and marketing literature, available for demonstration by knowledgeable Distributor personnel, provided that Distributor must obtain prior approval by Tripath before any customer receives demonstration Products (customer samples).\n\n3.5 Distributor has no authorization to make, and will not make, any guarantee or warranty with respect to any Product \u2014 all Product warranties are to be communicated to Customers directly by Tripath in writing. Distributor will make no representations as to quality, performance, capabilities, and the like except as are expressly authorized in writing by Tripath (such as in Tripath's standard, published specifications for a Product).\n\n4. Other Product Lines\n\n4.1 In appointing Distributor, Tripath is relying to a significant extent on Distributor's undertaking in Subsection 2.2.\n\n4.2 Distributor will not carry any competitive products without Tripath's consent, which shall not be unreasonable.\n\n5. Tripath Direct Sales Activity\n\n5.1 Tripath may in its sole discretion, immediately upon written notice to Distributor, make direct sales to certain accounts in the Territory (\"Direct Sales Accounts\"), including accounts to which Distributor has made sales.\n\n6. Pricing, credits, and allowances\n\n6.1 Prices for Products will be as set forth in the then effective distributor price list (\"Distributor Price List\") which will be furnished to Distributor from time to time. Any suggested resale prices shown in the Distributor Price List are to be considered as guidelines only.\n\n6.2 The Distributor Price List may be changed without prior notice, and will be effective as of the effective date indicated. The amount and timing of such change will be exclusively at Tripath's discretion.\n\n6.3 Orders for Products received and acknowledged by Tripath prior to a change in the Price List but shipped after the effective date of such change will be invoiced as follows: (a) in the case of a price decrease, the existing order backlog will be invoiced at the lower price, and (b) in the case of a price increase, the existing order backlog due for delivery within one month of the effective date of such change will be invoiced at the lower price. Outstanding written quotations will be held good for the same two-month period.\n\n6.4 Distributor's inventory of any Product will be price protected for reductions in the price of such Product as follows: the lesser of Distributor's (a) entire inventory of the Product, or (b) previous one month's shipments of the Product from Tripath.\n\n7. Purchase Orders and Payment\n\n7.1 Distributor will maintain sufficient inventory of Products (but not less than one month's inventory without Tripath's approval) to provide prompt delivery to Distributor's customers, in furtherance of Distributor's undertaking in Subsection 2.2.\n\n-2-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistributor Agreement\n\n7.2 Distributor will purchase Products for resale to its customers in accordance with Tripath's then effective terms and conditions of sale set forth in the Tripath sales order acknowledgment (\"Sales Order Acknowledgment\"), and the pricing terms of the then effective Distributor Price List (including minimum order quantities). The terms and conditions of sale in the Sales Order Acknowledgment may be changed without prior notice, exclusively at Tripath's discretion.\n\n7.3 No purchase order from Distributor is binding on Tripath until Tripath issues a Sales Order Acknowledgment to Distributor for such order, or makes a shipment against such order. Tripath will use commercially reasonable efforts to acknowledge Distributor purchase orders promptly.\n\n7.4 Tripath will invoice Distributor for Products when Tripath ships such Products.\n\n7.5 All credits will be handled as separate financial transactions from the original invoice, and will be evidenced by a written credit request submitted to Tripath. Distributor will not reduce any payment to Tripath to account for anticipated or unauthorized credits (except for short shipments and non-receipt of Products), either at the time of the payment of original invoice, or at the time of providing a credit request. Credit requests should be submitted by Distributor within one month after the date of Distributor's invoice for the related transactions.\n\n7.6 Any credit request will be based on the price shown on the then current Distributor Price List, or the actual net price paid by Distributor for the Product, whichever is lower.\n\n7.7 If Tripath notifies Distributor of any discrepancy in a credit request, Distributor has one month to resolve the discrepancy and pay the amount of the discrepancy.\n\n7.8 No purchase orders for which a Sales Order Acknowledgment has been issued may be canceled or rescheduled within one month of the scheduled shipment date without Tripath's approval.\n\n8. Special Pricing and Other Allowances\n\n8.1 The provisions of this Section 8 will be applicable only to transactions on DPA (distributor price authorization) basis in which Distributor first obtains a DPA confirmation from Tripath.\n\n8.2 Requests for special pricing and/or allowances will be submitted by Distributor to the appropriate Tripath sales office, and must be first approved in writing by that office.\n\n8.3 Quotes for special pricing are good for one month, and must be backed by a Tripath quote number. Distributor will supply supporting documentation showing Products listed by part number, date of transaction, end customer name and address, and the appropriate special pricing details, not later than two weeks after shipment to the associated customer.\n\n8.4 If Tripath has granted Distributor special pricing on a sale in which Distributor's customer has later returned the Product to Distributor, Distributor will reimburse Tripath for the amount of the DPA allowance within one month after such return.\n\n8.5 Any debit memo submitted by Distributor for a DPA allowance will be based on the price shown on the then current Distributor Price List, or the actual net price paid by Distributor for the Product, whichever is lower.\n\n9. Returns\n\n9.1 Distributor may return Products only after receiving written authorization from Tripath. All authorized returns will be shipped by Distributor freight prepaid. Unauthorized returns may be reshipped to Distributor, freight collect.\n\n-3-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistributor Agreement\n\n9.2 Distributor may request stock rotation return of slow moving Products, which will be authorized by Tripath provided that: (a) the Product is contained in Tripath's then current Distributor Price List, (b) the Product is packaged as it was originally shipped, and (c) a purchase order for equal value accompanies the request for return. Such stock rotation returns will not exceed five percent (5%) of the dollar value of Distributor's previous six (6) months net purchase orders from Tripath.\n\n9.3 Discontinued Product may be returned only with prior written authorization.\n\n9.4 Credit will be allowed for returned Products based on the price actually paid by Distributor, less any prior DPAs, credits and other allowances.\n\n9.5 If, in the reasonable opinion of Tripath, previously authorized returned Products have been used or damaged, a credit or replacement may be refused. Distributor will be notified within one month after receipt of Product by Tripath of any such Product Tripath is claiming to be used or damaged.\n\n10. Limited Warranty\n\n10.1 Tripath provides an end user limited warranty for retail Products, and one-year limited warranty for OEM products. The terms of the end user limited warranty are set forth in documentation provided with the retail Product.\n\n10.2 For OEM Products, Tripath warrants that the Products will be free of manufacturing and workmanship defects for one year from the date of shipment by Distributor to a customer, or eighteen months from the date of shipment to Distributor, whichever is sooner.\n\n10.3 If any OEM Products prove defective during this one year period as set forth in Section 10.2, Tripath will, at its option, either (a) repair or replace the Product with a new or reconditioned Product, (b) use reasonable efforts to provide Distributor with a correction of the defect, or (c) refund to Distributor the purchase price paid for the Product. Any Product replaced will become Tripath property.\n\n10.4 Distributor must return the defective OEM Product pursuant to a return material authorization under Section 9.1 in the original shipping carton (or an equivalent protective carton), and pay the shipping and insurance charges.

Tripath at its sole option will be relieved of the foregoing obligations unless Distributor or its customer notifies Tripath promptly in writing of such action and gives Tripath full information and assistance to settle and/or defend any such action. If it is adjudicated that a Product infringes, or if the sale or use of a Product is, as a result, enjoined, then Tripath will, at its option and expense either: (i) procure for Distributor and its customers the right to sell or use the Product; or (ii) replace the Product with other suitable Product; or (iii) suitably modify the Product to be noninfringing; or (iv) if none of the foregoing are commercially reasonable, as determined by Tripath, accept return of the affected Products and refund Distributor's aggregate payments for such Products, less a reasonable sum for use and/or damage, if any.\n\n19.2 Limitation.

The foregoing provisions of this section 19 state the entire liability and obligations of Tripath and the exclusive remedy of Distributor and its customers, with respect to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement by the Products.\n\n20. Limitation of Liability\n\n20.1 Neither Tripath nor Distributor will be liable for any incidental or consequential\n\n-7-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistributor Agreement\n\ndamages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information, or other pecuniary loss) arising out of this Agreement, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n21.

All notices under this Agreement will be sent by receipted courier (e.g., U.P.S.).\n\n21.5 Non-Waiver. The failure of either party to enforce at any time any of the provisions of this Agreement will not be construed as a waiver of the right of such party to subsequently enforce any such provisions or a waiver of the provision itself.\n\n21.6 Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of California, without reference to conflicts of laws.\n\n21.7 Arbitration. Any dispute or claim arising out of this Agreement will be referred to and resolved by the International Chamber of Commerce (\"ICC\") in accordance with the ICC Arbitration Rules.

The Distributor shall initiate purchases under this Agreement by submitting written purchase orders (each, an \"Order\") to JRVS. Such orders shall state unit quantities, unit descriptions, requested delivery dates, and shipping instructions. No purchase order shall be binding upon JRVS until accepted by JRVS in writing. JRVS reserves the right to reject orders in whole or in part. Partial shipment of an order shall not constitute acceptance of the entire order. In the event that JRVS is unable to fill an accepted purchase order in accordance with the schedule set forth therein as long as the purchase order does not exceed 110% of the iMine Products set forth on the most recent forecast for such month, JRVS will use commercially reasonable efforts to fill such order on an allotment basis. This Agreement shall govern all orders placed by the Distributor for units of the Product. No terms on purchase orders, invoices or like documents produced by the Distributor shall alter or add to the terms of this Agreement. Any other terms and conditions of sale in conflict with or inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, whether contained in the Distributor's preprinted forms or otherwise, notwithstanding JRVS's acceptance otherwise, shall have no force or effect to the extent of such conflict or inconsistency. 4.3 Order Requirements. The Distributor's single purchase order amount shall be a minimum of five units. Non-standard Products may have higher minimum purchase requirements and longer lead time as determined by JRVS. 4.4 Lead Time. The Distributor shall submit purchase orders to JRVS in accordance with a lead time of twenty-eight (28) to one hundred and twenty (120) days according to the schedule advised by JRVS. In no event shall the lead time for Non-standard Products be less than two (2) months. JRVS shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver units of Product at the times set forth in JRVS's written acceptances of the Distributor's purchase orders. 4.5 Demonstration Units. Orders by Distributor for samples and/or pilot run may be subject to smaller amount and shorter cycle time as shall be requested by Distributor and accepted by JRVS. In such cases, products may be ordered in multiples of smaller units (calculated in number of reels or tubes), and in no events shall exceed three such units. 4.6 Cancellations. Except as provided herein, all Orders for Products are non-cancelable, and Products are non-returnable (NC/NR). Subject to JRVS's written approval, orders for mining rigs may be rescheduled or cancelled subject to the cancellation fees, which are based on the number of days in advance of the scheduled shipment date that the Distributor notifies JRVS of cancellation and shall be set by JRVS from time to time. The Nonstandard Products are at all times non-cancelable. Distributor shall contact JRVS in advance for pricing and delivery information for orders of Non-standard Products. 5.1 JRVS Price. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Distributor shall pay for the Products at the then current price of JRVS (the \"JRVS Price\") at the time of placement of the Order. 5.2 Price Change. JRVS shall have the right to revise JRVS Price at any time. Price changes shall apply to all purchase orders received after the effective date with the notice, except that any price increase shall be effective immediately upon notice to Distributor and apply to those accepted but undelivered orders. 5.3 Special Pricing. Notwithstanding the JRVS Price, special pricing on any one of the Products may be extended to the Distributor, in JRVS sole discretion, in situations where special pricing is necessary for the Distributor to obtain sale of the Products to a Customer. If JRVS elects to extend such special pricing, it will issue a confidential meet comp quote number documenting the special price quoted. Upon receipt of the meet comp quote number, the Distributor may ship the Products to the Customer from stock and debit JRVS for the difference between their invoiced amount, less any prior credits granted by JRVS, and the new special pricing. The meet comp quote number shall be included on all such debits. 5.4 Taxes.

The indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of any suit or claim relating to the liability if it has assumed responsibility for the suit or claim in writing; however, if in the reasonable judgment of the indemnified Party, such suit or claim involves an issue or matter which could have a material adverse effect on the business operation or assets of the indemnified Party, the indemnified Party may waive its rights to indemnity under this Agreement and control the defense or settlement thereof, but in no event shall any such waiver be construed as a waiver of any rights such indemnified Party may have against any Third Party at law or in equity.

Neither of the Parties may settle a claim or action related to a Third Party Claim without the consent of the other Party, if such settlement would impose any monetary obligation on the other Party, or would require the other Party to submit to an injunction or otherwise limit the other Party's rights under this Agreement. Any payments made by a Party to settle any such claim or action shall be at its own costs and expense, except in the event such payment was made with the prior written consent of an indemnifying Party, in which case such payment shall be subject to the obligations of the Parties as set forth in Sections 11.1 (Indemnification by Achaogen), 11.2 (Indemnification by Microgenics), and 11.3 (Conditions to Indemnification).   11.5 Limitation of Liability.

Confidential Treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions.\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidential Treatment Requested by Achaogen, Inc.   diagnostic industry practices.   12 Confidentiality   12.1 Nondisclosure. During the Term, and for a period of [***] ([***]) years thereafter, all Confidential Information disclosed to a Party hereto or its Affiliates (the \"Receiving Party\") by the other Party or its Affiliates (the \"Disclosing Party\") shall be deemed confidential and shall be treated as such by the Receiving Party (meaning that the Receiving Party shall take the same steps to protect such information as it does to protect its own confidential information, which in any event shall be no less than the reasonable protective measures for the industry) and shall only be used for the purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information shall not include information that is:     (a) known by the Receiving Party at the time of its receipt and not through a prior disclosure by the Disclosing Party;     (b) at the time of disclosure or thereafter, becomes published or otherwise part of the public domain through no breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party;     (c) subsequently disclosed to the Receiving Party by a Third Party having the right to make such a disclosure; or     (d) developed by the Receiving Party, as evidenced by its records, independently of information received by it from the Disclosing Party hereunder.   12.2 Permitted Disclosure.  Information provided under this Agreement may be disclosed to employees, agents or consultants of the Receiving Party, but only to the extent required to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement and only after the Receiving Party obtains the prior agreement of its employees, agents and consultants to whom disclosure is to be made to hold in confidence and not to make use of such information for any purpose other than that permitted by this Agreement. In addition to the foregoing exceptions, either Party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent it is required to be disclosed under Applicable Law, or in connection with any application by the Receiving Party for any Regulatory Approvals; provided, however, that the Receiving Party shall furnish the Disclosing Party with as much prior written notice of such disclosure requirement as reasonably practicable, so as to permit the Disclosing Party, in its sole discretion, and at its sole expense, to take appropriate action, including seeking a protective order, in order to prevent the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information from passing into the public domain or becoming generally available to the public.   12.3 Publicity. The Parties agree to make a joint public release of the having entered into this Agreement upon the successful completion of Phase I as described in Exhibit F. The public release must however not contain any Confidential Information of any kind such as scientific, commercial or financial which both Parties have not agreed to include in writing. No public announcement concerning the existence, terms or subject matter of this Agreement shall be made, either directly or indirectly, by any Party, without first obtaining the prior written approval of the other Party and agreement upon the nature and text of such public announcement which such agreement and approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, in the opinion of legal counsel for the Party desiring to make such public announcement, such disclosure is required under Applicable Law, subject to Section 12.2 (Permitted Disclosure) above, the Party required to make such public announcement shall inform the other Parties of the proposed announcement or disclosure in reasonably sufficient time prior to public release, which shall be not\n\nPage 31 of 60 [***] Certain information in this document has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential Treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions.\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidential Treatment Requested by Achaogen, Inc.   less than [***]  ([***]) business days (or such shorter period as may be required under Applicable Law) prior to release of such proposed public announcement, and shall provide the other Parties with a written copy thereof in order to allow such other Parties to comment upon such public announcement. The Receiving Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Disclosing Party (at the Disclosing Party's expense) with respect to all disclosures regarding this Agreement required under Applicable Law, including requests for confidential treatment of proprietary information of the Disclosing Party included in any such disclosure.    12.4 Applicable Law. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as preventing or in any way inhibiting any Party from complying with Applicable Law governing activities and obligations undertaken pursuant to this Agreement, in any manner which it reasonably deems appropriate, including, for example, by disclosing to Regulatory Authorities confidential or other information received from the other Parties, subject to Sections 12.2 (Permitted Disclosure) and 12.3 (Publicity).   12.5 Non-Use of Names. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, neither Party (or its Affiliates) shall use, either directly or indirectly, the Trademarks of the other Party (or their Affiliates), or the names of any of their officers, employees or board members in any publicity, marketing advertising or other documents (or other disclosures) unless (a) such use is consistent with, and permitted under, the Project Plan or (b) a copy or transcript of the proposed disclosure is submitted to and approved in advance in writing by the other Party (each in its sole discretion), except in the case in which a governmental authority requires the use of the Trademark by a Party in the sale or distribution of the Assay or Plazomicin. Each Party will use good faith efforts to review and approve any proposed disclosure within [***] ([***]) business days of its receipt from the other Party of a copy or transcript of the proposed disclosure. If a Party approves the other Party's usage of its Trademarks (or its Affiliates), or the names of any of their officers, employees or board members in accordance with this Section 12.5 (Non-Use of Names), the other Party shall comply with any usage guidelines or requirements imposed by the approving Party.   12.6 Publications. Publication in a journal, paper, magazine or any other such similar disclosure relating to the development, manufacture or commercialization of the Assay will not take place without the prior written agreement of both Achaogen and Microgenics, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any draft article intended to be submitted for publication by Microgenics or Achaogen (or a clinical trial site utilized by Achaogen) hereto shall first be sent to the other Party in order to allow such Party to preserve its intellectual property rights by delaying such publication (but not for more than  [***] ([***]) days) and/or removing its Confidential Information. Achaogen's and/or Microgenics' contribution shall be acknowledged in any publication by co-authorship or acknowledgment, whichever is appropriate. Republication of any article, in whole or in part, which has previously been approved by the Parties shall not require subsequent approval, provided that the content is substantially unchanged. These restrictions are not applicable to Plazomicin; provided, however, that, for clarity, Microgenics shall have no right to publish with respect to Plazomicin.   12.7 Prior CDAs. This Agreement supersedes that certain Confidential Disclosure Agreement between the Parties dated  [***]; provided, however, that all Confidential Information disclosed or received by the Parties thereunder will be deemed Confidential Information hereunder and will be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. For clarity, this Agreement does not supersede the Antibody Development Agreement.   13 Miscellaneous   13.1 Force Majeure. Neither Party shall be liable to the other for delay or failure in the\n\nPage 32 of 60 [***] Certain information in this document has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential Treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions.\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidential Treatment Requested by Achaogen, Inc.   performance of the obligations on its part contained in this Agreement if and to the extent that such failure or delay is due to government action, war, terrorism, fire, explosion, flood, strike, lockout, embargo, shortage of materials or utilities, vendor failure to supply, act of God, or any other cause beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the defaulting Party (a \"Force Majeure Event\"), provided that the Party claiming Force Majeure Event has exerted all Commercially Reasonable Efforts to avoid or remedy such force majeure. Such excuse shall continue as long as the condition preventing the performance continues. Upon cessation of such Force Majeure Event, the affected Party shall promptly resume performance hereunder. Each Party agrees to give the other Party prompt written notice of the occurrence of any such Force Majeure Event, the nature thereof, and the extent to which the affected Party will be unable to perform its obligations hereunder. Each Party further agrees to use all Commercially Reasonable Efforts to correct the Force Majeure Event  [***] and to give the other Party prompt written notice when it is again fully able to perform its obligations hereunder.   13.2 Assignment. Neither Party may assign this Agreement to a Third Party unless both Parties have agreed to such assignment in a writing signed by an authorized representative of each Party hereto; provided, however, that upon providing written notice, (i) either Party may, without the other Party's consent, assign this Agreement to an Affiliate or to any Third Party entity that acquires all or substantially all of its assets to which this Agreement relates and (ii) Achaogen may, without Microgenics' consent, assign this Agreement (in whole or in part) to a Third Party licensee of Achaogen's rights with respect to Plazomicin. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the Parties. Any assignment not in accordance with this Section 13.2 (Assignment) shall be void.   13.3 No Waiver. The failure of either Party to require performance by the other Party of any of that other Party's obligations hereunder shall in no manner affect the right of such Party to enforce the same at a later time. No waiver by any Party hereto of any condition, or the breach of any provision, term, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or breach, or of any other condition or of the breach of any other provision, term, representation or warranty hereof.   13.4 Severability.  If a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction should hold any term or provision of this Agreement to be excessive, or invalid, void or unenforceable, the offending term or provision shall be deleted, and, if possible, replaced by a term or provision which, so far as practicable, achieves the legitimate aims of the Parties. In the event that such provisions cannot be agreed upon, the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of one or more provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity of this Agreement as a whole.   13.5 Relationship Between the Parties. Both Parties are independent contractors under this Agreement. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to create an employment, agency, joint venture or partnership relationship between the Parties hereto or any of their agents or employees, or any other legal arrangement that would impose liability upon one Party for the act or failure to act of the other Party. Neither Party shall have any express or implied power to enter into any contracts or commitments or to incur any liabilities in the name of, or on behalf of, the other Party, or to bind the other Party in any respect whatsoever.\n\nPage 33 of 60 [***] Certain information in this document has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

USDA is responsible for the enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. 2131 et. seq), http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/legislat/awa.htm\n\nThe Public Health Service (PHS) Policy is administered by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) http://grants2.nih.gov/grants/olaw/olaw.htm. An essential requirement of the PHS Policy, http://grants2.nih.gov/grants/olaw/references/phspol.htm is that every institution using live vertebrate animals must obtain an approved assurance from OLAW before they can receive funding from any component of the U.S. Public Health Service.\n\nThe PHS Policy requires that Assured institutions base their programs of animal care and use on the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/labrats/ and that they comply with the regulations (9 C.F.R., subchapter A) http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/legislat/usdaleg1.htm issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) under the Animal Welfare Act. The Guide may differ from USDA regulations in some respects. Compliance with USDA regulations is an absolute requirement of this Policy.\n\nThe Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) http://www.aaalac.org is a professional organization that inspects and evaluates programs of animal care institutions at their request. Those that meet the high standards are given accredited status. As of the 2002 revision of the PHS policy, the only accrediting body recognized by PHS is the AAALAC. While AAALAC Accreditation is not required to conduct biomedical research, it is highly desirable. AAALAC uses the Guide as their primary evaluation tool. They also use the Guide for the Care and Use of Agricultural Animals in Agricultural Research and Teaching. It is published by the American Science Societies. http://www.fass.org.\n\nPage 56 of 60 [***] Certain information in this document has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential Treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Contract Provision\n\nClause\n\nH.20: Requirements for Adequate Assurance of Protection of Vertebrate Animal Subjects\n\nThe PHYS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals requires that applicant organizations proposing to use vertebrate animals file a written Animal Welfare Assurance with the Office for Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW), establishing appropriate policies and procedures to ensure the humane care and use of live vertebrate animals involved in research activities supported by the PHS. The PHS Policy stipulates that an applicant organization, whether domestic or foreign, bears responsibility for the humane care and use of animals in PHS-supported research activities. Also the PHS policy defines \"animal\" as \"any live, vertebrate animal used, or intended for use, in research, research training, experimentation, biological testing or for related purposes.\" This policy implements and supplements the U.S. Government Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing, Research, and Training, and requires that institutions use the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as a basis for developing and implementing an institutional animal care use program. This Policy does not affect applicable State or local laws or regulations that impose more stringent standards for the care and use of laboratory animals. All institutions are required to comply, as applicable, with the Animal Welfare Act, as amended and other Federal statutes and regulations relating to animals. These documents are available from the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, (301) 496-7163. http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/olaw.htm.\n\nNo PHYS supported work or research involving vertebrate animals will be conducted by an organization, unless that organization is operating in accordance with an approved Animal Welfare Assurance and provides verification that the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) has reviewed and approved the proposed activity in accordance with the PHS policy. Applications may be referred by the PHS back to the institution for further review in the case of an apparent or potential violations of the PHS policy. No award to an individual will be made unless that individual is affiliated with an assured organization that accepts responsibility for compliance with the PHS Policy. Foreign applicant organizations applying for PHS awards for activities involving vertebrate animals are required to comply with PHS Policy or provide evidence that acceptable standards for the humane care and use of animals will be met. Foreign applicant organizations are not required to submit IACUC approval, but should provide information that is satisfactory to the Government to provide assurances for the humane care of such animals.\n\nH.21: Approval of Required Assurance by OLAW\n\nUnder governing regulations, federal funds which are administered by DHHS, Office of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) shall not be expended by the contractor for research involving live vertebrate animals, nor shall live vertebrate animals be involved in research activities by Company under this award unless a satisfactory assurance of compliance with 7 U.S.C. 2316 and 9 CFR Sections 2.25-2.28 is submitted within 30 days of the date of this award and approved by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW). Each performance site (if any) must also assure compliance, with the following restriction: Only activities which do not directly involve live vertebrate animals (i.e., are clearly severable and independent from those activities) may be conducted by the contractor or individual performance sites pending OLAW approval of their respective assurance of compliance.\n\nPage 57 of 60 [***] Certain information in this document has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential Treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Contract Provision\n\nClause\n\nH.22: Registration with the Select Agent Program for Work involving the possession, use, and/or transfer of select biological agents or toxins\n\nCompany shall not conduct work involving select agents or toxins under this contract until it and any associated subcontractor(s) comply with the following:\n\nFor prime or subcontract awards to domestic institutions that possess, use, and/or transfer Select Agents under this contract, the institution must comply with the provisions of 42 C.F.R. part 73, 7 C.F.R. part 331, and/or 9 C.F.R. part 121 ( http://www.aphis.usda.gov/programs/ag_selectagent/FinalRule3-18-05.pdf ) as required, before using NIH funds for work involving a Select Agent or Toxin. No government funds can be used for research involving a Select Agent or Toxin at a domestic institution without a valid registration certificate.\n\nFor prime or subcontract awards to foreign institutions that possess, use, and/or transfer a Select Agent or Toxin, before using NIH funds for any work directly involving a Select Agent or Toxin, the foreign institution must provide information satisfactory to the government that safety, security, and training standards equivalent to those described in 42 C.F.R. part 73, 7 C.F.R. part 331, and/or 9 C.F.R. part 121 are in place and will be administered on behalf of all Select Agent or Toxin work supported by these funds. The process for making this determination includes inspection of the foreign laboratory facility by a government representative. During this inspection, the foreign institution must provide the following information: concise summaries of safety, security, and training plans; names of individuals at the foreign institution who will have access to the Select Agents and procedures for ensuring that only approved and appropriate individuals, in accordance with institution procedures, will have access to the Select Agents under the contract; and copies of or links to any applicable laws, regulations, policies, and procedures applicable to that institution for the safe and secure possession, use, and/or transfer of select agents. No funds can be used for work involving a Select Agent or Toxin at a foreign institution without written approval from Achaogen.\n\nListings of HHS select agents and toxins, and overlap select agents or toxins as well as information about the registration process for domestic institutions, are available on the Select Agent Program Web site at http:// www.cdc.gov/od/sap/ and http://www.cdc.gov/od/sap/docs/salist.pdf.\n\nListings of USDA select agents and toxins as well as information about the registration process for domestic institutions are available on the APHIS/USDA website at: http://www.aphis.usda.gov/programs/ag_selectagent/ index.html and: http://www.aphis.usda.gov/programs/ag_selectagent/ag_bioterr_forms.html\n\nFor foreign institutions, see the NIAID Select Agent Award information: http://www.niaid.nih.gov/ncn/clinical/default_biodefense.htm.\n\nH.23: EPA Energy Star Requirements\n\nAll microcomputers, including personal computers, monitors, and printers purchased with government funds in the performance of a contract shall be equipped with or meet the energy efficient low-power standby feature as defined by the EPA Energy Star program unless the equipment always satisfies Energy Star efficiency levels.\n\nPage 58 of 60 [***] Certain information in this document has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential Treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Contract Provision Clause\n\nH.24: Acknowledgement of Federal Funding\n\n(a)Section 507 of P.L. 104-208 mandates that contractors funded with Federal dollars, in whole or in part, acknowledge Federal funding when issuing statements, press releases, requests for proposals, bid solicitations and other documents. Contractors are required to state (1) the percentage and dollar amounts of the total program or project costs financed with federal money, and (2) the percentage and dollar amount of the total costs financed by nongovernmental sources. This requirement is in addition to the continuing requirement to provide an acknowledgement of support and disclaimer on any publication reporting the results of a contract funded activity. (b)Publication and Publicity. The contractor shall acknowledge the support of the Department of Health and Human Service, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority whenever publicizing the work under this contract in any media by including an acknowledgment substantially as follows: \"This project has been funded in whole or in part with Federal funds from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, under Contract no. HHSO100201000046C. (c)Press Releases. Pursuant to Section 508 of Public Law 105-78, the contractor shall clearly state, when issuing statements, press releases, requests for proposals, bid solicitations and other documents describing projects or programs funded in whole or in part with federal money that: (1) the percentage of the total costs of the program or project which will be financed with federal money; (2) the dollar amount of Federal funds for the project or program; and (3) the percentage and dollar amount of the total costs of the project or program that will be financed by nongovernmental sources. H.25: Manufacturing Standards\n\nThe Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations (\"cGMP\") (21 C.F.R. Parts 210-211) and regulations pertaining to biological products (21 C.F.R. Part 600) will be the standard to be applied for manufacturing, processing, packing, storage, and delivery of this product.\n\nIf at any time during the life of the contract, Company fails to comply with cGMP in the manufacturing, processing and packaging of this product and such failure results in a material adverse effect on the safety, purity or potency of this product (a material failure), the Contractor shall have thirty (30) calendar days from the time such material failure is identified to cure such material failure. If the Contractor fails to take such an action within the thirty (30) calendar day period, then the contract may be terminated for default.\n\nH.26: Export Control Notification\n\nCompany is responsible for ensuring compliance with all export control laws and regulations that may be applicable to the export of and foreign access to their proposed technologies.\n\nPage 59 of 60 [***] Certain information in this document has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential Treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Contract Provision Clause\n\nH.27: Institutional responsibility Regarding Conflicting Interests of Investigators\n\nCompany shall comply with the requirements of 45 CFR Part 94, Responsible Prospective Contractors, which promotes objectivity in research by establishing standards to ensure that investigators (defined as the principle investigator and any other person who is responsible for design, conduct, or reporting of research funded under BARDA contracts) will not be biased by any conflicting financial interest. For the purposes of this part relating to financial interest, \"investigator\" includes the investigator's spouse and dependent children.\n\nCompany shall at a minimum:\n\n(a)Maintain a written, enforceable policy on conflict of interest and inform each investigator of the policy, the investigator's reporting responsibilities, and the applicable regulations. The contractor must take reasonable steps to ensure that investigators working as collaborators or subcontractors comply with the regulations. (b)Designate and official to review financial disclosure statements from each investigator participating in BARDA-funded research.

Reports of the results of any such examination (each an \"Audit Report\") will be (a) limited to details of any discrepancies in MMT's records relating to the Product together with an explanation of the discrepancy and the circumstances giving rise to the discrepancy (b) made available to both Parties and (c) subject to ARTICLE 10. An Audit Report shall become final and binding on the Parties thirty (30) days following MMT's receipt thereof, unless MMT delivers written notice of its agreement thereto (in which case such Audit Report shall become final and binding on the date of delivery of such notice of agreement) or written notice of its disagreement thereto (\"Notice of Disagreement\") to SIGA in either case on or prior to such date. If a timely Notice of Disagreement is delivered by MMT to SIGA, then the Audit Report shall become final and binding on the Parties on the earlier of (i) the date MMT and SIGA resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement, and (ii) the date all matters in dispute are finally resolved in writing by the Independent Auditor. During the thirty (30) days following delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, MMT, SIGA and SIGA's Auditor shall seek to resolve in writing any differences which they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such thirty (30) day period, if no resolution has been reached, MMT and SIGA shall submit such dispute to an independent top four certified public accountant other than SIGA's Auditor and reasonably acceptable to both Parties (the \"Independent Auditor\") for resolution of all matters which remain in dispute which were included in the Notice of Disagreement, and the Independent Auditor shall make a final determination with respect thereto (with it being understood that the Parties will request that the Independent Auditor deliver to the Parties its resolution in writing not more than 30 days after its engagement). The Independent Auditor shall make a determination only with respect to the matters still in dispute and, with respect to each such matter, its determination shall be within the range of the dispute among MMT, SIGA and SIGA's Auditor. If an Audit Report as finally determined pursuant to this Section 6.5 (a \"Final Audit Report\") concludes that (i) additional amounts were owed by MMT, MMT will pay the additional amounts, or (ii) excess payments were made by MMT, SIGA will reimburse such excess payments, in either case ((i) or (ii)), within thirty (30) Business Days after the date on which an Audit Report is deemed a Final Audit Report. SIGA will bear the full cost of the performance of any such audit, including the fees of SIGA's Auditor and the Independent Auditor, unless a Final Audit Report, which covers the entire Calendar Year, discloses a variance to the detriment of the auditing Party of more than [***] from the amount of the original report, royalty or payment calculation, in which case MMT will bear the full cost of the performance of such audit. The results of such audit, including any determination made by the Independent Auditor, will be final, absent manifest error.\n\n18\n\nSource: SIGA TECHNOLOGIES INC, 8-K, 6/3/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n6.6 Blocked Payment and Indemnification. If either Party utilizes a Restricted Party in the activities contemplated under this Agreement, without a license or other authorization required by Global Trade Control Laws or in circumstances where reimbursement by the non-utilizing Party would violate or create exposure to adverse consequences under Global Trade Laws, the non-utilizing Party shall not be responsible for any payments due to the utilizing Party or any other party resulting from the activities involving such Restricted Party even if the contractual obligation related thereto has already accrued. Any and all payments due to such utilizing Party or any other party resulting from such activity involving a Restricted Party shall be entirely at such utilizing Party's expense. Further, if the conduct of any activity or a transaction under this Agreement was in violation of applicable Global Trade Control Laws for any reason, such violating Party shall indemnify the other Party for any liability resulting from such activity or transaction, including any and all fines and penalties assessed to such other Party as a result of such activity or transaction. 6.7 Source of Recovery. Any outstanding amounts due and payable by SIGA pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including reimbursements for Supply Penalties pursuant to Section 5.5 and any amounts owed to an MMT Indemnitee pursuant to SIGA's indemnification obligations in Section 9.1, at MMT's option, can be set-off by MMT from any Quarterly Payment until such amounts are fully recovered; provided that any amounts that are subject to a dispute properly brought under ARTICLE 12 may not be set-off pursuant to this Section 6.7. 6.8 Taxes. (a) Taxes on Income. Each Party will pay all taxes (including related interest and penalties) imposed on its share of income arising directly or indirectly from the efforts of, or the receipt or deemed receipt of any payment by, such Party under this Agreement. (b) Tax Withholding. Subject to Section 6.8(c) and Section 6.8(d), if any taxes (including related interest and penalties) are required to be withheld by or on behalf of MMT with respect to an amount payable to SIGA, (a) MMT will withhold such taxes from such amount, timely pay the withheld taxes to the proper taxing authority and furnish reasonably satisfactory proof of payment to SIGA; and (b) SIGA will reasonably assist MMT in its efforts to obtain a refund of or credit for such withholding tax in accordance with Section 6.8(c). Any amount actually withheld and remitted by MMT to a taxing authority pursuant to this Section 6.8(b) will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to SIGA. If MMT makes a payment without deduction for tax withholding and an amount of tax should have been withheld from such payment, MMT shall be entitled to recover the under withheld tax by an additional withholding from any amount payable to SIGA under this Agreement, and to the extent such recovery is insufficient, SIGA shall indemnify MMT for any such amount. No amount shall be withheld, or a reduced amount shall be withheld, as applicable, if, in accordance with Section 6.8(d), a Party that is entitled to a payment timely furnishes the other Party with the necessary tax forms and other documents prescribed by Laws, which shall be in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Party receiving the documents, identifying that the relevant payment is exempt from tax or subject to a reduced tax rate.\n\n19\n\nSource: SIGA TECHNOLOGIES INC, 8-K, 6/3/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) VAT. It is understood and agreed between the Parties that the amount of any payments contemplated under this Agreement are exclusive of any value added tax, sales tax or any similar tax (\"VAT\"), which shall be added thereon as applicable. Where VAT is properly added to a payment made under this Agreement, MMT or SIGA, as applicable, will pay the amount of the VAT, if applicable, but only on receipt of a valid tax invoice issued in accordance with applicable Law of the country in which the VAT is chargeable. (d) Tax Cooperation. The Parties agree to cooperate with one another and use reasonable efforts to reduce or eliminate tax withholding, VAT or similar obligations in respect of royalties, milestone payments, and other amounts payable under this Agreement. SIGA and MMT will provide each other with any applicable tax forms that may be reasonably necessary in order for the other Party not to withhold tax or to withhold tax at a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty or pursuant to applicable internal law. Each Party will provide the other with reasonable assistance to enable the recovery, as permitted by Law, of withholding taxes, VAT, or similar obligations resulting from payments made under this Agreement, such recovery to be for the benefit of MMT or SIGA, as applicable, to the extent it has complied with the requirements of this Section 6.8 in respect of such obligations.

The Party claiming indemnity under this ARTICLE 9 (the \"Indemnified Party\") shall give written notice to the Party from whom indemnity is being sought (the \"Indemnifying Party\") promptly after becoming aware of a Claim for which indemnity may be sought hereunder (it being understood and agreed, however, that the failure by an Indemnified Party to give notice of a Claim for which indemnity may be sought as provided in this Section 9.3 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligation under this Agreement except that in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be liable for any Losses that result from any delay in providing such notice). The Indemnified Party will provide the Indemnifying Party with reasonable assistance, at the Indemnifying Party's reasonable expense, in connection with the defense of the Claim for which indemnity is being sought. The Indemnified Party may participate in and monitor such defense with counsel of its own choosing at its sole expense; provided, however, the Indemnifying Party shall assume and conduct the defense of the Claim and may so defend any such Claim with counsel of its choosing. The Indemnifying Party will not settle any Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, not to be unreasonably withheld, unless the settlement involves only the payment of money by the Indemnifying Party. So long as the Indemnifying Party is actively defending the Claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party will not settle or compromise any such Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume and conduct the defense of the Claim as provided above, (a) the Indemnified Party may defend against, consent to the entry of any judgment, or enter into any settlement with respect to such Claim in any manner the Indemnified Party may deem reasonably appropriate (and the Indemnified Party need not consult with, or obtain any consent from, the Indemnifying Party in connection therewith), and (b) the Indemnifying Party will remain responsible to indemnify the Indemnified Party as provided in this ARTICLE 9. The assumption of the defense by the Indemnifying Party will not be construed as an acknowledgment that the Indemnifying Party is liable to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such Claim, nor will it constitute a waiver by the Indemnifying Party of any defenses it may assert against the Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification.\n\n30\n\nSource: SIGA TECHNOLOGIES INC, 8-K, 6/3/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4 Insurance.

The Parties agree to execute and deliver such other documents, certificates, agreements and other writings and to take such other actions as may be reasonably necessary to consummate or implement expeditiously the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.\n\n40\n\nSource: SIGA TECHNOLOGIES INC, 8-K, 6/3/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n13.8 Severability. Each of the provisions contained in this Agreement will be severable, and the unenforceability of one will not affect the enforceability of any others or of the remainder of this Agreement. If any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement, or the application thereof in any circumstances, is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the Parties will negotiate in good faith with a view to the substitution therefor of a suitable and equitable solution to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid provision; provided, however, that the validity, legality and enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions of this Agreement will not be in any way impaired thereby, it being intended that all of the rights and privileges of the Parties hereto will be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law. 13.9 No Waiver. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver will be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition. The waiver, delay or the failure of any Party to enforce or exercise any term, condition or part of this Agreement at any time or in any one or more instances will not be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or any other term, condition or part, nor will it forfeit any rights, power or privilege to future enforcement thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by Law, (a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement or any of the documents referred to in this Agreement can be discharged by one Party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other Party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a Party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one Party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of that Party or of the right of the Party giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, all rights and remedies available to a Party, whether under this Agreement or afforded by Law or otherwise, will be cumulative and not in the alternative to any other rights or remedies that may be available to such Party. 13.10 Relationship of the Parties. Neither Party will have any responsibility for the hiring, termination or compensation of the other Party's employees or for any employee benefits of such employee. No employee or representative of a Party will have any authority to bind or obligate the other Party to this Agreement for any sum or in any manner whatsoever, or to create or impose any contractual or other liability on the other Party without said Party's approval. For all purposes, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, SIGA's legal relationship to MMT under this Agreement will be that of independent contractor and nothing in this Agreement gives either Party the power or authority to act for, bind, or commit the other Party in any way. This Agreement is not a partnership agreement. Nothing in this Agreement will be construed to establish a relationship of partners, principal and agent or joint venturers between the Parties or their respective employees or Affiliates. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to create a \"separate entity\" or \"business entity\" within the meaning of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or the regulations thereunder and any foreign equivalents thereto. Neither MMT nor SIGA will make any statements, representations, or commitments of any kind, or to take any action that is binding on the other, without the prior consent of the other Party to do so.\n\n41\n\nSource: SIGA TECHNOLOGIES INC, 8-K, 6/3/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n13.11 English Language.

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which is an original, but all of which together constitute one and the same instrument. Each Party may execute this Agreement by facsimile transmission or by PDF. In addition, facsimile or PDF signatures of authorized signatories of any Party will be deemed to be original signatures and will be valid and binding, and delivery of a facsimile or PDF signature by any Party will constitute due execution and delivery of this Agreement. 13.13 Schedules. The disclosure of any matter in any Section of or on any Schedule to this Agreement will only be deemed to be a disclosure for the Section or subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds in number, unless the applicability of such Schedule to any other Section is readily apparent. The disclosure of any matter in any Schedule to this Agreement will expressly not be deemed to (a) constitute an admission by either Party hereto, or (b) imply that any such matter is material for purposes of this Agreement. 13.14 Expenses.

the Product\n\n1. Scope: SIGA has a legal and corporate responsibility to comply with applicable regulations governing the collection and reporting of adverse events (\"AE(s)\"), at risk scenarios (\"ARSs\"), unexpected therapeutic effects (\"UTEs\"), and product quality complaints (\"PQC(s)\") associated with the Product, as these terms are defined below. For the purposes of this Exhibit, AEs, ARSs, UTEs, and PQCs are collectively termed \"Safety Reports.\"\n\nMMT is expressly entitled to perform any regulatory responsibilities for the Product through any of its Affiliates. MMT or an Affiliate of MMT shall exchange Safety Reports with the SIGA contact listed in section 4.1 Reporting Time-Frames. Throughout this Safety Reporting Exhibit, SIGA shall be referred to as \"SIGA\" and MMT and its Affiliates collectively as \"Promoter.\" At all times SIGA and Promoter shall follow the procedures set out below.\n\nThe procedures described in this Agreement are to be followed for pharmacovigilance activities for the Product, irrespective of any other activities between SIGA and Promoter which are contained within the Agreement.\n\n2. Definitions: 2.1. Adverse event (AE): an AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered the Product. The event need not have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. This includes, but is not limited to: \u2022 Abnormal test findings \u2022 Clinically significant symptoms and signs\n\nSource: SIGA TECHNOLOGIES INC, 8-K, 6/3/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Changes in physical examination findings \u2022 Hypersensitivity \u2022 Progression/worsening of underlying disease \u2022 Lack of drug efficacy \u2022 Drug abuse \u2022 Drug dependency \u2022 Signs and symptoms resulting from drug withdrawal and drug interactions \u2022 Suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product 2.2. At risk scenarios (ARSs): circumstances where the report does not include an AE per se, but nevertheless needs to be reported to SIGA. These circumstances include: \u2022 Medication errors (including incorrect prescription or dispensing of a prescription, whether or not administered to the patient) \u2022 Exposure during pregnancy \u2022 Exposure during breastfeeding \u2022 Overdose \u2022 Extravasation \u2022 Occupational exposure \u2022 Off-label use 2.3. Unexpected therapeutic effect (UTEs): a beneficial therapeutic effect of the Product aside from the use for which it had been given. 2.4. Product quality complaint (PQC(s)): is any written or oral expression of dissatisfaction relative to the physical properties, condition, labelling, potency and/or packaging of the Product, including whether the Product is suspected or confirmed to be counterfeit.\n\n3. Promoter Responsibilities: 3.1. Promoter shall ensure that all employees and, if applicable, subcontractor employees performing activities under this Agreement (\"Promoter Personnel\") who may become aware of a Safety Report associated with the use of the Product comply with the requirements set out in this Exhibit. 3.2. If Promoter Personnel become aware of a Safety Report that may be associated with the Product, Promoter shall inform SIGA in accordance with the reporting procedures included in this Exhibit and as may be updated and provided to Promoter in the future by SIGA. 3.3. In the event Promoter engages a subcontractor to perform services related to this Agreement, Promoter shall request fulfilment by that subcontractor of these safety reporting requirements on substantially the same terms as those outlined in this Exhibit, unless it is established that there is no possibility that the subcontracted services will involve receipt or handling of Safety Reports by the subcontractor.\n\nSource: SIGA TECHNOLOGIES INC, 8-K, 6/3/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4. In the event that Promoter receives a communication from a Regulatory Authority relating to the Product, Promoter shall inform SIGA as soon as possible, but in any event no later than one (1) Business Day or three (3) calendar days of receipt, whichever is shorter. Where possible, SIGA shall be informed prior to, and have the opportunity to review, any response to the regulatory authority by Promoter.\n\n4. Reporting Process: 4.1. Reporting Time-Frames: Promoter shall report all Safety Reports to SIGA within two (2) Business Days or four (4) calendar days of awareness, whichever is shorter. All reports shall be sent to:\n\nDrug Safety Unit - Contact Details: Regulatory Affairs, SIGA Technologies E-mail: drugsafety@siga.com Telephone: 541-753-2000 Fax: 541-753-9999\n\nPostal Address: SIGA Technologies, Inc.4575 Research Way, Suite 110, Corvallis, OR 97333\n\n4.2. Case Receipt Confirmation: The receipt of Safety Reports from Promoter shall be acknowledged by SIGA in writing no later than one (1) Business Day following receipt. If acknowledgement of receipt is not received within this timeframe, then Promoter shall contact SIGA to determine if the source documents need to be re-sent. 4.3. Case Documentation and Record Retention: Promoter shall document all Safety Reports received and reported to SIGA. Documentation shall include, where possible the name, address, and telephone number of the reporter, and whether consent has been given by the reporter to be re-contacted by SIGA. Promoter will maintain a record of each Safety Report received, including relevant source documents, and a record of each Safety Report reported to SIGA for a minimum period of ten (10) years after the expiration or termination of this Agreement and, if requested, will provide these and any other information requested by SIGA. Notwithstanding the aforementioned requirement, before Promoter destroys any Safety Reports and associated source documents, or training records, it will notify SIGA of its intention to do so and afford SIGA the opportunity to retain such records if it so wishes.\n\nSource: SIGA TECHNOLOGIES INC, 8-K, 6/3/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Data Privacy: In forwarding Safety Reports to SIGA, Promoter shall comply with all applicable privacy and data protection laws, rules and regulations on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of Personal Data and the free movement of such data. \"Personal Data\" means information that can be used by itself or in combination with other available information to identify a specific individual. The Promoter shall collect, use and disclose any Personal Data obtained in the course of performing the safety related activities under this Agreement solely for the purposes of complying with the regulatory obligations as described in this Agreement, or as otherwise required by law or by a court order. Promoter shall use electronic, physical, and other safeguards appropriate to the nature of the information to prevent any use or disclosure of Personal Data other than as provided for by this Agreement. Promoter will also take reasonable precautions to protect the Personal Data from alteration or destruction.\n\nPromoter shall notify SIGA promptly of any accidental, unauthorized, or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or disclosure of, or access to, the Personal Data (\"Security Breach\"), and take immediate steps to rectify any Security Breach.\n\n6. Audit: SIGA, or its authorized representatives, shall have the right, at its cost, with reasonable advance notice, during regular business hours, to audit the facility used by the Promoter in order to review the Promoter activities under this Exhibit including, but not limited to, any documents relevant to these activities, for compliance with the safety reporting requirements set out in this Exhibit. Where evidence of non- compliance is identified SIGA and Promoter will jointly discuss to determine appropriate corrective and preventive actions and Promoter will provide SIGA with regular reports on the completion status of the identified corrective and preventive actions.\n\nSource: SIGA TECHNOLOGIES INC, 8-K, 6/3/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nSCHEDULE 8.2(b)\n\nENCUMBRANCES The assets of SIGA are subject to a lien under the Loan and Security Agreement dated September 2, 2016.\n\nSource: SIGA TECHNOLOGIES INC, 8-K, 6/3/2019"}]}, {"title": "VgrabCommunicationsInc_20200129_10-K_EX-10.33_11958828_EX-10.33_Development Agreement", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Mobile Application Development Agreement", "answer_start": 1186}], "id": "VgrabCommunicationsInc_20200129_10-K_EX-10.33_11958828_EX-10.33_Development Agreement__Document Name", "question": "The name of the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "VAL", "answer_start": 56}, {"text": "VGrab Asia Ltd.", "answer_start": 1350}, {"text": "Mr. Zheng Qing, Mr. Gu Xianwin and Ms. Chen Weijie", "answer_start": 1493}], "id": "VgrabCommunicationsInc_20200129_10-K_EX-10.33_11958828_EX-10.33_Development Agreement__Parties", "question": "The two or more parties who signed the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "5th Day of March, 2019", "answer_start": 1318}], "id": "VgrabCommunicationsInc_20200129_10-K_EX-10.33_11958828_EX-10.33_Development Agreement__Agreement Date", "question": "The date of the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "This Agreement shall commence on 5th March 2019", "answer_start": 2806}], "id": "VgrabCommunicationsInc_20200129_10-K_EX-10.33_11958828_EX-10.33_Development Agreement__Effective Date", "question": "The date when the contract is effective\u00a0", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "This Agreement will be for the maximum period of six (6) months beginning for the commencement date, renewable in accordance with the terms hereof, unless earlier terminated pursuant to this Agreement.", "answer_start": 2871}, {"text": "This Agreement commences on the date it is executed and shall continue until full performance by both parties, or until earlier terminated by one party under the terms of this Agreement.", "answer_start": 11557}], "id": "VgrabCommunicationsInc_20200129_10-K_EX-10.33_11958828_EX-10.33_Development Agreement__Expiration Date", "question": "On what date will the contract's initial term expire?", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [], "id": "VgrabCommunicationsInc_20200129_10-K_EX-10.33_11958828_EX-10.33_Development Agreement__Renewal Term", "question": "What is the renewal term after the initial term expires?

If Company fails to achieve the Minimum Number of Details Requirement, the Minimum Reach Requirement or, if applicable, the Minimum PDE Requirement or the Minimum Top Target Requirement in any Detailing Period, Janssen shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by giving thirty (30) days' notice, unless:\n\n(a) Company complied with and performed its Detailing activities in accordance with any Remediation Plans developed by Company and approved by Janssen during such Detailing Period; or\n\n(b) if (i) neither Party provided a Performance Failure Notice under Section 3.2.4 during such Detailing Period and (ii) Company performs additional Details in the first month after such Detailing Period such that, if such Details had been performed during such Detailing Period, they would have been sufficient to cure the failure to achieve the Minimum Number of Details Requirement, the Minimum Reach Requirement, the Minimum PDE Requirement or the Minimum Top Target Requirement, as applicable. To avoid double-counting, such additional Details will not be taken into account when determining whether Company satisfies the Minimum Number of Details Requirement, Minimum Reach Requirement or, if applicable, the Minimum PDE Requirement or the Minimum Top Target Requirement in the then-current Detailing Period.\n\nFor clarity, (i) Company must achieve all of the applicable foregoing minimum requirements in order to avoid giving rise to Janssen's rights and remedies under this Section 3.2.3, and (ii) such rights shall be in addition to any other rights and remedies that may be available to Janssen under applicable Laws in the event of any such failure on the part of Company.\n\n3.2.4 Monthly Detailing Reports.\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) No later than [***] ([***]) Business Days following the end of each month during the Term, Company shall report to Janssen the number of Details performed (and any other information necessary to determine whether the requirements set forth in Section 3.2.2 and Exhibit B have been satisfied) during such month by the Sales Representatives in accordance with this Agreement and the Call Plan, as reported by the Company Internal Detail Reporting System.

It is the intent of the Parties that all Disputes relating in any way to this Agreement should be resolved in accordance with this Article, including Disputes that may involve the parent companies, subsidiaries, and other Affiliates of any Party.\n\n13.2 Negotiation. Before any Dispute may be submitted to mediation or arbitration as provided below, the Dispute shall be referred to the President of Janssen and the Chief Executive Officer of Company for discussion and attempted resolution. No statements made by either Party during such discussions will be used by the other Party or admissible in arbitration or any other\n\n\n\n\n\nsubsequent proceeding for resolving the dispute. If such executives do not resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days of such referral by either Party, then either Party may, upon written notice to the other Party, submit the Dispute to mediation pursuant to Section 13.3 and binding arbitration pursuant to Section 13.4.\n\n13.3 Mediation.\n\n13.3.1 The Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve any Dispute that is not resolved pursuant to Section 13.2 by confidential mediation in accordance with the then current Mediation Procedure of the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution (\"CPR Mediation Procedure\") (http://www.cpradr.org) before initiating arbitration.

The Parties agree to select the mediator within twenty (20) days of the notice and the mediation will begin promptly after the selection. The mediation will continue until the mediator or either Party, declares in writing, no sooner than after the conclusion of one full day of a substantive mediation conference attended on behalf of each Party by a senior business person with authority to resolve the Dispute, that the Dispute cannot be resolved by mediation. In no event, however, shall mediation continue more than sixty (60) days from the initial notice by a Party to initiate meditation unless the Parties agree in writing to extend that period.\n\n13.3.3 Any period of limitations that would otherwise expire between the initiation of mediation and its conclusion shall be extended until twenty (20) days after the conclusion of the mediation.\n\n13.4 Arbitration. If the Parties fail to resolve a Dispute by mediation under Section 13.3 and either Party desires to pursue resolution of the Dispute, the Dispute shall be submitted by either Party for resolution in arbitration pursuant to the then current CPR Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration of International Disputes (\"CPR Rules\") (http://www.cpradr.org), except where they conflict with these provisions, in which case these provisions control. CPR is designated as the Neutral Organization for all purposes.\n\n13.4.1 Language/Location. The arbitration shall be conducted in English in New York, New York.\n\n13.4.2 Selection of Arbitrators.\n\n(a) The arbitrators will be chosen from the CPR Panels of Distinguished Neutrals, unless a candidate not on the CPR Panels of Distinguished Neutrals is approved by both\n\n\n\n\n\nParties.

To the extent that the Dispute requires special expertise, the Parties will so inform CPR prior to the beginning of the selection process.\n\n(b) The arbitration tribunal shall consist of three (3) arbitrators, chosen in accordance with Rules 5.3 and 6 of the CPR Rules. If, however, the aggregate award sought by the Parties is less than five million United States dollars (USD $5,000,000) and equitable relief is not sought, a single arbitrator shall be chosen in accordance with Rules 5.3 and 6 of the CPR Rules.\n\n(c) Candidates for the arbitrator position(s) may be interviewed by representatives of the Parties in advance of their selection, provided that all Parties are represented.\n\n(d) The Parties agree to select the arbitrator(s) within forty-five (45) days of initiation of the arbitration.\n\n13.4.3 Conduct of Proceedings.\n\n(a) The hearing will be concluded within nine (9) months after selection of the arbitrator(s) and the award will be rendered within 60 days of the conclusion of the hearing, or of any post hearing briefing, which briefing will be completed by both sides within 45 days after the conclusion of the hearing. In the event the Parties cannot agree upon a schedule, then the arbitrator(s) shall set the schedule following the time limits set forth above as closely as practical.\n\n(b) The arbitrator(s) shall be guided, but not bound, by the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Commercial Arbitration (www.ibanet.org).\n\n(c) The hearing will be concluded in ten hearing days or less. Multiple hearing days will be scheduled consecutively to the greatest extent possible. A transcript of the testimony adduced at the hearing shall be made and shall be made available to either Party.\n\n13.4.4 Applicable Law. The arbitrator(s) shall decide the merits of any Dispute in accordance with the law governing this Agreement, without application of any principle of conflict of laws that would result in reference to a different law. The arbitrator(s) may not apply principles such as \"amiable compositeur\" or \"natural justice and equity.\"\n\n13.4.5 Award.\n\n(a) The arbitrator(s) shall render a written opinion stating the reasons upon which the award is based. The arbitrator(s) may award the costs and expenses of the arbitration as provided in the CPR Rules, but each Party shall bear its own attorney fees.\n\n(b) The award may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. If a court is called upon to enforce an award in a court proceeding, the Parties consent\n\n\n\n\n\nto the court's requiring the Party resisting enforcement to pay the reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in that proceeding by the Party seeking enforcement.\n\n13.4.6 Provisional Relief. Any Party may seek emergency, interim, or provisional relief prior to the appointment of the arbitrator(s) from any court of competent jurisdiction, without waiver of the agreements to mediate and arbitrate. After appointment of the arbitrator(s), any request for emergency, interim, or provisional relief shall either be addressed to the arbitrator(s), which shall have the power to enter an interim award granting relief using the standards provided by applicable law, or to a court, but only with the permission of the arbitrator(s).

The Party who has suffered the Force Majeure shall notify the other Party without delay of any such incident(s) occurring, and the Parties shall discuss the effects and extent of such incident(s) on this Agreement and the measures to be taken. Each Party shall use Diligent Efforts to avoid or restrict Force Majeure and to mitigate any loss therefrom. In the event of an incident or incidents of Force Majeure, the Party whose performance has been affected thereby shall as soon as reasonably possible resume performance of its obligations hereunder. If any Force Majeure substantially prevents, hinders, or delays performance by a Party in a manner and to an extent that would, but for this Section, constitute a material breach or give rise to a right of termination hereunder, and the performance is not materially restored within one hundred eighty (180) days, the other Party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to such Party.\n\n14.3 Independent Contractors. Nothing in this Agreement shall create or imply an association, partnership, or joint venture between the Parties, it being agreed and understood that the Parties are independent contractors; and neither Party, with respect to a Third Party, shall have the power or authority to bind or obligate the other Party in any way.

The Project Team shall oversee the Project. Prior to each meeting of the Project Team the Parties will distribute to each other written copies of all materials, data and information arising out of the conduct of their activities hereunder.\n\n***Confidential Treatment Requested   10\n\n\n\n\n\n  Each Party shall bear its own costs associated with such meetings and communications. It is the right of each Party to call for a Project Team meeting according to the covenants of this Section 2.2 upon written request at any time.   The Parties shall alternate responsibility for preparing minutes of the meeting which shall be circulated promptly following the meeting.   The initial members of the Project Team and the Project Managers are set forth in Appendix 3 attached hereto which may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in the Project Team and/or Project Managers as provided in this Section 2.2.   2.2.3 Steering Committee   The Parties shall form a Steering Committee, to which each Party will appoint three (3) executive employees, including the Project Managers, all of whom shall be familiar with the Project.

Each Party shall have the right to substitute its members of the Steering Committee as needed from time to time by giving written notice to the other Party due time in advance.   The Steering Committee shall meet within [...***...] after receipt of a written request by one Party to the other Party. The request shall describe the matter in dispute and the solution which the requesting Party proposes to be decided. Each Party shall bear its own costs associated with meetings and communications of the Steering Committee.   The Steering Committee will take action by unanimous consent of the Parties, with the representatives of BII collectively having a single vote and the representatives of XENCOR collectively having a single vote, or by a written resolution signed by all of the representatives. If the Steering Committee is unable to reach unanimous consent on a particular matter, then the matter will be referred to the chief executive officers of the Parties, who will use good faith efforts to resolve such matter, and the decision reached by mutual agreement of the chief executive officers of the Parties shall be final and binding on the Parties. If, (i) after good faith efforts, the chief executive officers of the Parties are unable to resolve such matter by mutual agreement, and (ii) such matter concerns the Product or the Process, but does not concern the BI Facility or the management of manufacturing slots, then the chief executive officer of XENCOR shall make the final decision about how to resolve such dispute, after good faith consideration of BII's position, which decision shall be final and binding on the Parties; provided, however, that, in resolving such matter, XENCOR's chief executive officer shall not have any authority to require BII or its Affiliated Companies to incur additional expenses or obligations not contemplated by this Agreement. In no event will the Steering Committee, or the executive officers of the Parties in resolving any Steering Committee matter, have any authority to amend or modify this Agreement; any such amendment or modification of this Agreement must be in accordance with Section 11.8. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section shall prevent any Party from seeking arbitration proceedings pursuant to Section 11.6 hereof with regard to any matters other than matters resolved by mutual agreement of the chief executive officers in accordance with this Section 2.2.3.   The members of the Steering Committee are set forth in Appendix 3 attached hereto, which may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in the Steering Committee as provided in this Section 2.2.3.   2.3 Conduct of the Project and BII's Work and Tasks   The Parties shall engage in the Project upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. In the course of this Agreement the Parties shall perform the Project as laid down and detailed in the Project Plan.   Each Party shall fully and reasonably cooperate with the other Party to provide appropriate information and assistance to the other Party in connection with the Project, responding in a\n\n***Confidential Treatment Requested   11\n\n\n\n\n\n  reasonable and timely manner with respect to all reasonable requests for information and approval. Neither Party shall be liable for any delays in its performance of the Project to the extent caused solely by the other Party's failure to provide in a reasonably timely manner any information or approval reasonably requested by the other Party.   The Parties shall assign a sufficient number of professionally qualified personnel to perform the Project and shall perform its tasks under this Agreement according to the generally acceptable professional and then current industry standards and subject to terms and conditions as set forth herein, at all times in compliance in all material respects with all requirements of applicable laws and regulations. The Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve the estimated timelines as laid down in the Project Plan.   Changes to the Project Plan, if any, shall require the written consent of both Parties.   2.4 Deliverables   BII will deliver such deliverables expressly laid down in detail in the Project Plan, including but not limited to the Product (the \"Deliverables\") within the timelines laid down in the Project Plan to XENCOR. Following the completion of the activities required under the Project, BII will provide to XENCOR then available Product (if any), Batch records and a summary containing manufacturing and analytical testing, including without limitation, the information and the results of the development phase according to the workscope as further described in the Project Plan.   2.5 Nature of the Project   As the Product has never been produced by BII or on behalf of BII by its Affiliated Companies at the BI Facility, XENCOR acknowledges that the Project is experimental in nature and that no favorable or useful results can be assured by BII. However, after [\u2026***\u2026], the Parties shall in good faith agree on a revision (if necessary) to the preliminary specifications for the Product (that have been mutually agreed upon by the Parties) that shall then be the Specifications for subsequent runs in subsequent campaigns that shall form a basis for rejection or acceptance of the respective Product produced in any additional runs at such scale under the provisions of Section 4.1, and, provided that the Process has not been materially changed (i.e. a change that is subject to the Change Control procedures of the QAA), the Project shall no longer be considered experimental in nature and the obligation to meet the respective Specification shall apply to all future runs at such scale.   2.6 Additional Work   In case the Parties mutually agree on additional work for the benefit of the Project by changing the Project Plan by written agreement of the Parties, BII shall perform such additional work to sustain the progress of the Project on conditions in terms of money, time and scope to be subject to agreement of the Parties hereto as set forth in the then amended Project plan.   2.7 XENCOR Confidential Information and Know-How and Material   To the extent not already transferred by XENCOR, XENCOR shall transfer the Material for the Project to BII to the BII Facility subject to the terms of this Section 2.7, and BII shall use or have used by its Affiliated Companies such Material solely to conduct the Project in accordance with the Project Plan, this Agreement, or as otherwise may be agreed to by the Parties in writing. The Material will not be used in connection with any animal studies or diagnosis, treatment or any activity in humans or for any use not directly related to the Project. BII's use of the Material will be in compliance with all applicable laws in the state or country where the Services are performed. BII accepts the Material with the knowledge that it is experimental. The Material may not be transferred or otherwise made available, in whole or in part, by BII to any other individual, entity or institution other than any Affiliated Companies\n\n***Confidential Treatment Requested   12\n\n\n\n\n\n  of BII without the prior written consent of XENCOR, which may be withheld by XENCOR for any reason. Such consent is hereby given for BII or its Affiliated Companies to transfer the Material for quality control testing performed by a third party on a blinded basis. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a transfer of Material to an Affiliated Company of BII or to any third party with the consent of XENCOR, BII shall ensure that the respective Affiliated Company or third party shall use such Material solely to conduct the Project in accordance with the Project Plan, this Agreement, or as otherwise may be agreed to by the Parties in writing and shall not transfer or otherwise make available, in whole or in part, the Material to any other individual, entity or institution.   The Material is the property of XENCOR. It is agreed that the transfer of the Material hereunder shall not constitute a sale of Material or a grant, option or license of any patent or other rights except to allow BII to perform the Project. XENCOR shall retain and have all right, title and interest in and to the Material.   XENCOR will inform BII in a timely manner about any safety issues of which XENCOR becomes aware relating to the handling of the Material and the Product after the date of the execution of this Agreement.   BII shall at all times take reasonable measures to protect the Material from loss or damage and in no event measures less than employed by BII in the protection of its own proprietary materials, and shall promptly notify XENCOR, if at any time it believes the Material has been damaged, lost or stolen.   XENCOR and BII hereby acknowledge and agree that XENCOR is providing XENCOR Confidential Information and Know-How to BII for its use by BII for the purposes of this Agreement, and BII will make use thereof solely for such purposes and XENCOR hereby consents to such use.   2.8 Further Obligations of XENCOR   2.8.1 General   The Parties acknowledge and agree, that. subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, BII substantially finances the Project at the costs and fees outlined in Appendix 2 in advance and receives payments at a later point in the future. Accordingly, XENCOR agrees, in order to make both Parties benefit from their collaboration, that the success of the collaboration between the Parties depends strongly on the fact whether or not XENCOR is able to find a suitable business partner for the further development of the Product into a successful medicinal product with one or more marketing authorisations worldwide.   2.8.2 Obligations of XENCOR   Therefore, XENCOR shall use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct and complete at its own cost and risk a Phase 1 clinical trial with the Product as described in Section 2.8.3 within the timelines set forth herein (subject to Section 2.8.3); and find one or more suitable third party/parties as business partner(s) for the further development of the Product into a medicinal product (\"Business Partner\").   For the avoidance of doubt, XENCOR bears the sole responsibility for the conduct and completion of the clinical trials of the Product and the search for the Business Partner and shall bear all costs and expenses in connection therewith. In no event will it be a breach of this Agreement by XENCOR if the Phase 1 clinical trial or other clinical trials of the Product are not completed or an agreement is not entered into with a Business Partner so long as XENCOR uses commercially reasonable efforts to do so.   2.8.3 Timelines and Information   XENCOR shall use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct and complete a Phase 1 clinical trial of the Product in a timely fashion and to search for the Business Partner. A summary of the preliminary plan for the Phase 1 clinical trial of the Product to be conducted by XENCOR is attached as Appendix 7, it being understood that timing of such clinical trial   13\n\n\n\n\n\n  may be delayed to the extent (i) caused primarily by BII's failure to provide Product conforming to the Specifications; or (ii) by safety issues relating to the Product; or (iii) by regulatory delays; or (iv) other causes outside the control of XENCOR.   XENCOR shall promptly provide BII notice of the completion and a summary overview of the outcome/observations of the Phase 1 clinical trial regarding the Product and a summary overview of any negotiations with a possible Business Partner regarding the further development of the Product. Moreover, XENCOR shall inform BII on an annual basis or, if there is good cause, upon request of BII (whichever is the case) about the actual status of such Phase 1 clinical trial or such negotiations, such request not to be more often than twice per year.   3 Payments   3.1 Project Fee   3.1.1 Consideration for Services   As consideration for the performance of BII's Services, XENCOR shall pay BII all fees to be paid to BII as set forth in the Project Plan (the \"Project Fees\") according to the terms and conditions set forth in the following subsections of this Section 3.1.   The Project Fees as set forth in the Project Plan include BII's internal and out\u00adof\u00adpocket cost and expenses for its performance of the Project, including without limitation, ordinary and standard raw materials, components and consumables, and XENCOR shall not be obligated to make any payments with respect to any Services except the Project Fees or payments for additional work agreed upon according to Section 2.6 (which shall then be considered \"Project Fees\").   3.1.2 Payment of the Project Fees   The Project Fees referred to in Section 3.1.1 above, together with interest at a [\u2026***\u2026] percent ([...***...]%) annual interest rate on any unpaid Project Fees accruing from the earlier of (i) the date of completion of the clinical summary report for the Phase 1 clinical trials of the Product as planned according to Appendix 7 unless delayed as described in Section 2.8.3 or (ii) the date that is five (5) calendar years after the Effective Date (each of the alternatives above, the \"Due Date\") until paid in full (the Project Fees together with any such interest, referred to as the \"Total Amount\"), shall become duly payable in accordance with the following schedule:   a. In case XENCOR has entered into an agreement with at least one Business Partner, then, beginning from the later of (i) the effective date of such agreement or (ii) the Due Date, XENCOR will pay BII the Total Amount in [...***...] installments of [...***...] of the [...***...] (defined below) that [...***...]; provided, however, that in no event will [...***...] of the annual Licensing Revenue [...***...]; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, [...***...] shall be excluded from [...***...].\n\n***Confidential Treatment Requested   14\n\n  b. In case XENCOR decides to proceed with the further development of the Product without a Business Partner, XENCOR will pay BII the Total Amount in one or more lump sum payments within five (5) calendar years from the Due Date.   c. As long as XENCOR, notwithstanding its commercially reasonable efforts after the completion of the Phase 1 clinical trial either (i) is not able to further develop the Product for technical and/or scientific reasons or (ii) does not decide to proceed with the further development of the Product without a Business Partner and does not enter into an agreement with a Business Partner within two (2) calendar years from the Due Date, then XENCOR shall have no obligation to pay BII any or all of the Total Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, such obligations will become due as described in this Section 3.1.2, at any time XENCOR enters into an agreement with at least one Business Partner or further develops the Product within ten (10) calendar years following the Effective Date, as provided in Section 10.3.   3.1.3 Invoicing   XENCOR shall notify BII in writing of any of the circumstances listed in Section 3.1.2.a to 3.1.2.c. BII shall issue an invoice for the payments of the Total Amount agreed upon with XENCOR according to the payment schedule in Section 3.1.2 and payment of the Technology Access Fee, as applicable. The amount of the Project Fees and the interest (if any) will be shown separately in the invoice.   XENCOR shall make payments of all invoiced amounts for the payments of the Total Amount and of the Technology Access Fee due and payable in accordance with Section 5.2.3 and 5.2.4, as applicable [...***...] from the date of receipt of BII's invoice. If XENCOR fails to make timely payment of the invoiced amount, interest shall accrue on the amount of the Project Fees shown in the invoice at a fixed annual rate equal to the highest rate of interest quoted as the \"prime rate\" in The Wall Street Journal on the day that payment was due. All payments due under this Agreement shall be paid in US dollars by wire transfer or by such other means agreed to in writing by the Parties. XENCOR will provide at least twenty-four (24) hours advance notice to BII of each wire transfer to the bank account identified below or such other bank accounts as BII shall designate in writing.\n\n       Account Name:\n\n  [...***...]\n\n  Account Number:\n\n  [...***...]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBank:\n\n  [...***...]\n\n  BIC (SWIFT-CODE):\n\n  [...***...]\n\n  IBAN:\n\n  [...***...]\n\n    3.2 Technology Access Fee   The Technology Access Fee (if any) is due according to Section 5.2.3 and 5.2.4 below.

If XENCOR determines after reviewing the relevant documentation and performing reasonable testing that any Batch does not meet the Acceptance Criteria, or if Product is determined by BII to be unsuitable for release, then the Parties will mutually agree, as promptly as reasonably possible, whether (a) to produce a new Batch at BII's cost and expense, including the costs of materials used in the manufacture of such Batch, or (b) to rework or reprocess the Batch, at BII's cost and expense, so that the Batch can be deemed to have been manufactured in compliance with cGMP and the agreed Process Description, and to conform to the Acceptance Criteria (provided that the Parties have mutually agreed in writing on any procedures for reworking or reprocessing a Batch). If the remedy set forth in either (a) or (b) is agreed to be performed by BII, then BII shall start the applicable work as soon as reasonably practicable, such that the next reasonably available (taking into consideration BII's entire contract manufacturing business) manufacturing slot shall be used by BII to produce Product, and BII will use commercially reasonable efforts to resupply within [...***...] but in any event no later than [...***...] from time of rejection by XENCOR. For the avoidance of doubt, if Product is not accepted by XENCOR as provided above, then BII's obligations set forth above shall apply both to the drug product and the bulk drug substance contained therein.   In the event XENCOR rejects the Product for Obvious Defects or Latent Defects as provided above, BII shall have the right to sample and retest the Product, which shall be done as soon as\n\n***Confidential Treatment Requested   16\n\n\n\n\n\n  practicable, provided that, if BII does not notify XENCOR in writing of its election to retest the Product within [...***...] after notice of rejection from XENCOR, BII shall be deemed to agree with XENCOR's rejection of the Product. In the event of a discrepancy between XENCOR's and BII' s test results such that one Party's results fall within the Acceptance Criteria and the other Party's test results fall outside the Acceptance Criteria, or there exists a dispute over whether such failure is due (in whole or in part) to acts or omissions of XENCOR or any third party after delivery, the Parties shall cause a testing laboratory agreeable to both Parties to perform comparative tests and/or analyses on samples of the alleged defective Product. The testing laboratory's results shall be in writing and shall be final and binding save for manifest error on the face of its report. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties in writing, the costs associated with such testing and review shall be borne by the Party against whom the testing laboratory result finally rules. The testing laboratory shall be required to enter into written undertakings of confidentiality no less burdensome than set forth or referred to by this Agreement.   4.2 Cancellation of Order   If XENCOR at any time cancels or postpones any campaign set forth in the Project Plan for the manufacture of Product for non-technical reasons later than [...***...] prior to the date on which inoculation of the respective production fermenter is to take place, XENCOR shall nevertheless be obliged to pay [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) of the Project Fees for such campaign to the extent that BII is not able to adequately use the respective capacity for such campaign alternatively (e.g. for production of any other material for any third party or itself) provided always that BII shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to use such capacity and mitigate any losses that may incur arising from such cancellation or postponement, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the reapplication of raw materials, if possible.   5 Ownership and Use of Project Data   5.1 Project Data   In consideration of the Project Fees:   a. BII shall carry out the Project by itself or by its Affiliated Companies) and provide XENCOR with a summary of the results from the Project, including manufacturing and analytical release and also shall provide XENCOR with a summary report about the results on the various stages of Process development;   b. BII shall supply XENCOR with data, results and information required to comply with any mandatory request of any applicable regulatory body in the Major Territories to comply with such regulatory body's requirements. BII shall provide complete Batch records for all cGMP runs and will provide to XENCOR all data reasonably necessary from all process development and manufacturing activities to enable XENCOR's preparation of any regulatory filings; and shall not unreasonably reject supplying data results and information required to comply with any requirement of any applicable regulatory body outside the Major Territories or cooperating with XENCOR's preparation of the chemistry, manufacturing and controls section of any regulatory filing supporting the clinical development of the Product in and outside the Major Territories.   BII shall bear the cost of such supply and cooperation by BII, provided that, if there are specific requirements of a given country that are significant and in addition to requirements of the Major Territories, the Parties will enter into good faith discussions whether additional resources and costs are required, with the intent of minimizing any additional cost to XENCOR.\n\n***Confidential Treatment Requested   17\n\n\n\n\n\n  c. Certain trade secret information may be provided by BII via DMF or similar filing (e.g. to a notified body) directly to the respective authorities.   d. For the avoidance of doubt, all summaries and/or reports generated as a result of the BII's performance under this Agreement and delivered to XENCOR by BII will be part of the Process and the sole and exclusive property of BII. Subject to XENCOR's confidentiality and non-use obligations hereunder and without affecting the ownership of Improvements as set forth in Section 8, BII hereby grants to XENCOR a non-exclusive, worldwide license to use and reproduce all such summaries and/or reports for all uses in connection with development activities relating to Product that do not involve manufacturing of Product (e.g., formulation work, toxicology studies or the development of a manufacturing process), regulatory activities relating to the Product and, to the extent necessary, any commercial activities relating to the Product, which XENCOR may sublicense in connection with any license of rights to the Product.   5.2 Use of the Process; Right of Negotiation   5.2.1 Use of the Process outside this Agreement   Except as set forth in this Agreement, the Process shall not be used by XENCOR or any third party outside the scope of this Agreement without the prior written consent of BII.   5.2.2 Right of First Negotiation to Manufacture   a. XENCOR hereby grants and will make an eventual Business Partner do so, BII a first right to negotiate to manufacture and supply Product for use in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. XENCOR shall provide BII written notice (i) of the completion of the Phase 1 clinical trials of the Product, which notice shall include reasonable documentation of the results of such Phase 1 clinical trials of the Product or (ii) that XENCOR has entered into an agreement with at least one Business Partner, whichever of (i) and (ii) occurs earlier. If BII provides XENCOR written notice of its exercise of the first right to negotiate within [...***...] after receipt of such written notice from XENCOR, then for a period of [...***...] following such written notice from BII or such longer period as agreed in writing by BII and XENCOR (or its Business Partner) (the \"Clinical Negotiation Period\"), XENCOR (or its Business Partner) and BII will negotiate in good faith an agreement for the manufacture and supply of Product for use in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, at market rate terms and conditions common for the contract manufacture of monoclonal antibodies within the contract manufacturing industry, to be mutually agreed in writing by the Parties. If BII does not provide written notice of its exercise of the first right to negotiate within such [...***...] period, XENCOR and any Business Partner shall be free to enter into one or more agreements with third parties for the manufacture and supply of Product for use in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. If BII provides written notice of its exercise of the first right to negotiate within such [...***...] period but BII and XENCOR (or its Business Partner) do not enter into such a contract manufacturing agreement within the Clinical Negotiation Period, XENCOR and any Business Partner shall be free to enter into one or more agreements with third parties for the manufacture and supply of Product for use in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials (which may include an agreement for any Business Partner or its affiliate to manufacture and supply Product for clinical trials), provided that the supply price for Product is no more than [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) of the clinical supply price of Product last proposed by BII during the negotiations between the Parties (or BII and the Business Partner). If the supply price for Product proposed by a third party (which may include a Business Partner or its affiliate) is more than [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) of the clinical supply price of Product last proposed by BII during the negotiations between the Parties (or BII and the Business Partner) , XENCOR (or its Business Partner) shall provide written notice to BII that XENCOR (and its Business Partner) will accept the clinical supply price last proposed by BII, and BII and XENCOR (or its Business Partner) will enter into a contract manufacturing agreement reflecting such clinical supply price; provided that, if BII does not agree to enter into such contract\n\n***Confidential Treatment Requested   18\n\n\n\n\n\n  manufacturing agreement within [...***...] after such written notice, XENCOR (or its Business Partner) shall be free to enter into an agreement with a third party (or an agreement for the Business Partner or its affiliate to manufacture and supply Product).   b. In addition, if BI has exercised its first right of negotiation in Section 5.2.2.a, XENCOR hereby grants and will make an eventual Business Partner do so, BII a first right to negotiate to manufacture and supply commercial Product as Principal Supplier for a period up to the [...***...], starting with the first commercial launch of the Product. XENCOR shall provide BII written notice (i) of the decision to have the Product manufactured at a commercial scale and to launch the Product commercially or (ii) that XENCOR has entered into an agreement with at least one Business Partner, whichever of (i) and (ii) occurs earlier. If BII provides XENCOR written notice of its exercise of the first right to negotiate within [...***...] after receipt of such written notice from XENCOR, then for a period of [...***...] following such written notice, or such longer period as agreed in writing by BII and XENCOR (or its Business Partner) (the \"Commercial Negotiation Period\"), XENCOR (or its Business Partner) and BII will negotiate in good faith an agreement for the manufacture and supply of commercial Product as Principal Supplier, at market rate terms and conditions common for the contract manufacture of monoclonal antibodies within the contract manufacturing industry to be mutually agreed in writing by the Parties. If BII does not provide written notice of its exercise of the first right to negotiate within such [...***...] period, XENCOR and any Business Partner shall be free to enter into one or more agreements with third parties for the manufacture and supply of commercial Product (which may include an agreement for any Business Partner or its affiliate to manufacture and supply commercial Product). If BII provides written notice of its exercise of the first right to negotiate within such [...***...] period but BII and XENCOR (or its Business Partner) do not enter into such a contract manufacturing agreement within the Commercial Negotiation Period, XENCOR and any Business Partner shall be free to enter into one or more agreements with third parties for the manufacture and supply, of commercial Product (which may include an agreement for any Business Partner or its affiliate to manufacture and supply commercial Product); provided that the supply price for Product is no more than [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) of the commercial supply price of Product last proposed by BII during the negotiations between the Parties (or BII and the Business Partner). If the supply price for Product proposed by a third party (which may include a Business Partner or its affiliate) is more than [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) of the commercial supply price of Product last proposed by BII during the negotiations between the Parties (or BII and the Business Partner), XENCOR (or its Business Partner) shall provide written notice to BII that XENCOR (and its Business Partner) will accept the commercial supply price last proposed by BII, and BII and XENCOR (or its Business Partner) will enter into a contract manufacturing agreement reflecting such commercial supply price; provided that, if BII does not agree to enter into such contract manufacturing agreement within [...***...] after such written notice, XENCOR (or its Business Partner) shall be free to enter into an agreement with a third party (which may include an agreement for any Business Partner or its affiliate to manufacture and supply Product).   c. The right set forth in Section 5.2.2.b shall automatically terminate if BII does not exercise the first right of negotiation set forth in Section 5.2.2.a. The rights set forth in Section 5.2.2.a and b shall automatically terminate if BII does not produce a viable Process for manufacture of Product as evidenced by failure to produce cGMP Product within a timeframe reasonably and customary in the biopharmaceutical industry for companies of comparable size and the respective activities.   d. In both cases set forth above, in Section 5.2.2.a. and b., if BII exercises its first right of negotiation, BII and XENCOR (and/or its Business Partner, as applicable) will negotiate in good faith a respective contract manufacturing agreement based on the market rate\n\n***Confidential Treatment Requested   19\n\n\n\n\n\n  terms and conditions common for the contract manufacture of monoclonal antibodies within the contract manufacturing industry, it being understood that any such contract manufacturing agreement would provide for Technology transfer, payment of the Technology Access Fee (if applicable), and other terms set forth in Sections 5.2.3, 5.2.4 and 5.2.5 below.   e. Any use of the Process by XENCOR or any third party outside the terms and conditions set forth in such contract manufacturing agreement is always subject to the provisions set forth in Section 5.2.3 below.   f. In the event that BII elects not to exercise its first right of negotiation described in Section 5.2.2.a or 5.2.2.b, or, despite their commercially reasonably efforts and good faith negotiations the Parties (or BII and the Business Partner) are unable to agree upon a manufacturing agreement within the Clinical Negotiation Period or, Commercial Negotiation Period, as applicable; and/or XENCOR (and/or XENCOR's Business Partner) wishes to use the Process outside the terms and conditions set forth in a contract manufacturing agreement with BII, BII shall transfer the Process in accordance with Section 5.2.3 below.   g. All of BII's rights of negotiation set forth in this Secti6n 5.2.2 shall terminate upon payment of the Technology Access Fee by XENCOR.   5.2.3 Technology Access Fee and Technology Transfer   In the event that XENCOR wishes to use or have used (e.g. by a Business Partner) the Process outside this Agreement or the terms and conditions set forth in a contract manufacturing agreement with BII, except as provided below, XENCOR shall pay BII a technology access fee of three million five hundred thousand (3,500,000.00) US dollars (the \"Technology Access Fee\").   In the event that XENCOR pays the Technology Access Fee set forth above, XENCOR shall have the right to use or have used (e.g. by a Business Partner) the Process worldwide for the manufacture of Product in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, without entering into a contract manufacturing agreement with BII.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Technology Access Fee shall be due or payable if BII does not produce a viable Process for manufacture of Product as evidenced by failure to produce cGMP Product within the timeframe agreed in the Project Plan or, if factors outside of the reasonable control of BII (such as e.g. a cell-line not suitable for production, delay in the growth of the cell line; shortage of raw materials and supplies, delay or non\u00adperformance of BII's suppliers, requests or orders of governments or regulatory authorities, etc.) require the timeframe in the Project Plan to be extended, the extended timeframe agreed upon in writing between BII and XENCOR that is reasonable and customary for paying customers in the biopharmaceutical industry for companies of comparable size and the respective activities. In addition, no Technology Access Fee shall be due or payable in connection with XENCOR's election to use or have used (e.g. by a Business Partner) the Process if (i) BII does not exercise its first right to negotiate under either Section 5.2.2.a or 5.2.2.b, (ii) BII exercises its first right to negotiate but demands a supply price for clinical/commercial supply of Product that exceeds the bid price for the clinical/ commercial supply of Product of a comparable quantity and quality by a third party biopharmaceutical CMO of comparable size and respective activities to BII and with registered headquarters in the Major Territories, or (iii) XENCOR (or its Business Partner) has entered into a contract manufacturing agreement with BII, but BII is not able to supply XENCOR and its Business Partners [...***...] of the Product required. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 5.2.3 (ii) shall affect such contract manufacturing agreement or BII's position as Principal Supplier, but XENCOR may solely request the Technology Transfer pursuant to the following sentences of this Section without paying the Technology Access Fee in order to have manufactured the amount of Product missing to satisfy XENCOR's and its Business Partners' demand.\n\n***Confidential Treatment Requested   20\n\n\n\n\n\n  For the avoidance of doubt, the Technology Access Fee is only due one time, and if XENCOR pays the Technology Access Fee, except for the Project Fees, no additional amount will be payable for use or having used the Process worldwide.   The Technology Access Fee includes Technology transfer support of [...***...] FTEs of BII for a period of [...***...] for each of the [...***...] FTEs in a time frame of [...***...] beginning with XENCOR's written request to use or have used (e.g. by a Business Partner) the Process outside the terms and conditions set forth in a contract manufacturing agreement with BII. Further support of BII requested by XENCOR shall be reimbursed at an hourly rate of [...***...] US dollars. The Parties will agree upon the times when to render such Technology transfer support in good faith.   Promptly following XENCOR's election to use the Process, BII shall start to transfer the Process and all reasonably necessary related BII Confidential Information and Know-How) to XENCOR or such designee experienced in the biopharmaceutical production and shall use commercially reasonable efforts, taking into consideration BII's entire contract manufacturing business and other contract manufacturing contracts, to transfer the Process as quickly as possible (and in any event within [...***...] from receipt of XENCOR's written election notice). Both Parties agree and XENCOR will make its Business Partner agree that BII may, however, select the way how to render such support of any Technology transfer at its own discretion, in particular but not only any support of such Technology transfer to a company whose primary business is providing biopharmaceutical CMO services (including e.g. a Technology transfer outside the BI Facility), provided, however, that BII's exercise of such discretion is not unreasonable.   XENCOR and/or any third party may not use the Process outside the terms and conditions set forth in a contract manufacturing agreement with BII except as set forth in Section 5.2.2 and this Section 5.2.3 and provided that XENCOR or it Business Partner strictly adhere to the license conditions set forth in Sect ion 5.2.5 herein.   5.2.4 Payment Terms   The Technology Access Fee, as applicable, shall be paid to BII upon completion of the Technology transfer described in Section 5.2.3 and shall be payable in accordance with the provisions set forth under Sections 3.2 and 3.3 above. Parties agree that the Technology transfer shall be completed upon the transfer of Process and all reasonably necessary related BII Confidential Information and Know-How.   5.2.5 License   Subject to XENCOR's adherence to the obligations under this Agreement, BII hereby grants XENCOR a worldwide, irrevocable, exclusive, sublicensable and royalty free license to use the Process and all reasonably necessary related BII Confidential Information and Know- How, BII Technology and BII Intellectual Property for the sole purpose of making and having made the Product; provided that such license shall become effective only upon complete payment of the Technology Access Fee, as applicable.   5.3 Acknowledgement   The Parties acknowledge that nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict XENCOR, itself or with or through any third party, from developing and using any process (except for the Process) for the manufacture of any of its products, including the Product, provided that no BII Confidential Information and Know-How is used and XENCOR adheres to its confidentiality and non-use obligations hereunder and complies with the ownership of intellectual property and Improvements as set forth in Section 8 below.\n\n***Confidential Treatment Requested   21\n\n\n\n\n\n  6 Representations, Warranties and Indemnification   6.1 Mutual Representations, Warranties and Covenants   Each Party hereby represents, warrants and covenants to the other Party as follows as of the Effective Date:   a. it is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the state or other jurisdiction of incorporation or formation; and   b. the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by such Party has been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action; and   c. it has full corporate authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder, and the Agreement is binding upon it in accordance with it terms; and   d. it has the right, without restriction, to grant the licenses granted under this Agreement.   6.2 XENCOR Warranties   XENCOR hereby warrants that:   a.

For avoidance of doubt, all XENCOR liability or indemnification obligations that might result from representations and the warranties under this Section 6 are always subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.4 of this Agreement.   6.3 BII Warranties   BII hereby warrants that:   a. BI is entitled to use the BI Facility and BII Confidential Information and Know-How, for the purposes set forth in this Agreement; and   b. BII at the Effective Date, it is not aware of any special or unusual hazards that would arise as a result of its carrying out of the Projects as planned; and   c. at the Effective Date, it has not been debarred, nor is it subject to a pending debarment, and that it will not, to the best of its Knowledge, use in any capacity in connection with   22\n\n\n\n\n\n  the Services under this Agreement any person, who has been debarred pursuant to section 306 of the FDCA, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 335a, or who is the subject of a conviction described in such section. BII agrees to notify XENCOR in writing immediately if it has Knowledge that BII or any person who is performing Services is debarred or is the subject of a conviction described in section 306, or if any action, suit, claim, investigation, or proceeding is pending, or to BII's Knowledge, is threatened, relating to the debarment or conviction of BII or any person performing Services under this Agreement; and   d. to the best of its Knowledge at the Effective Date its performance under this Agreement including, but not limited to, the BII Technology and its use in the Process, by BII, XENCOR or a third party manufacturer of XENCOR does not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party and it will promptly notify XENCOR in writing should it become aware of any claims asserting such infringement or of any third party intellectual property rights, that would be infringed by the BII Technology and its use in the Process. For the avoidance of doubt, the currently pending Cabilly dispute is excluded and will be addressed/ compensated by XENCOR once applicable: and   e. as of the Effective Date no third party has asserted any claim or lawsuit against BII claiming infringement of any intellectual property owned by a third party with relation to BII Technology and/or the Process, or any part or component thereof.   For avoidance of doubt, all BII liability or indemnification obligation that might result from representations and the warranties under this Section 6 are always subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.4 of this Agreement.   6.4 Process for Defense of Infringement of Third Party Intellectual Property   Subject to each Party's indemnification obligations, in the event that there occurs a Claim (as defined below), the Parties shall follow the following procedures with respect to the defense of the Claim:   a. BII agrees that if a third party threatens or asserts any claim or files any lawsuit, claiming that BII Intellectual Property utilized under this Agreement and necessary for manufacture and production of the Product in accordance with this Agreement, including, without limitation, the BII Technology or the Process, or the use thereof, constitutes infringement of any intellectual property owned by a third party (each, a \"Claim\"), BII will promptly and timely inform XENCOR of such Claim, and BII shall have the first right to negotiate, litigate and/or settle any such Claim, and shall defend any such Claim unless it would not be commercially reasonable for BII to bear the reasonably anticipated losses, damages, costs and expenses arising from any settlement or judgment resulting from such Claim. For the avoidance of doubt, the term \"commercially reasonable\", as used in this paragraph a. shall be determined (i) in the context of BII's entire business related to the intellectual property that is the subject to the Claim, where the Claim asserts infringement that impacts aspects of BII's business beyond the XENCOR relationship, and (ii) if the Claim asserts infringement that is limited only to activities performed for XENCOR, in the context of the entire relationship between XENCOR and BII.   b. BII will keep XENCOR reasonably informed about such negotiation or litigation at all times, including all material events related thereto, and in the event that the amounts paid or to be paid by BII in settlement of any such Claim or group of related or unrelated Claims appear reasonably likely to exceed, individually or in the aggregate, BII's indemnification obligations, or any contemplated settlement would place any obligations or restrictions upon XENCOR or the Product, then BII shall immediately inform XENCOR.   c. XENCOR shall not be responsible to pay for any costs of any settlement by BII of any Claim(s) (including, without limitation, any payments resulting of such settlement) that   23\n\n\n\n\n\n  exceed BII's indemnification obligations or be bound by any obligations or restrictions agreed to by BII in any such settlement, in case such settlement is made without the prior written consent of XENCOR, which may be granted or withheld in its sole discretion.   d. In the case that BII decides not to negotiate, litigate or settle any Claim, XENCOR shall have the right to negotiate, litigate and settle any such Claim, and, provided that XENCOR decides to pursue such negotiation, litigation or settlement, BII will provide all commercially reasonable cooperation to XENCOR such that XENCOR may appropriately defend such Claims.   6.5 Disclaimer of Warranties   EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, TECHNOLOGY, RIGHTS, RESULTS OF THE PROJECTS, MATERIAL, THE DELIVERABLES OR OTHER SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THAT THE PROJECTS WILL RESULT IN A COMMERCIALLY-VIABLE PROCESS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABIIITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.   7 Liability, Indemnification, Limitations and Insurance   7.1 General   BII has no control over the manner in which XENCOR intends to use the results of the Project, the Product or the Deliverables, if any, obtained in the Project and in particular does not know or control how XENCOR intends to use such Product or results in clinical studies.   7.2 Liability   a.

Notwithstanding                   the foregoing, the parties agree to issue an initial press                   release regarding the relationship between Excite and                   NetGrocer, the timing and wording of which will be mutually                   agreed upon,.\n\n7.       OTHER BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES\n\n         a)       Excite currently plans to develop a consumer packaged goods                   (\"CPG\") program that would combine the broad reach of the                   Excite Network with the depth of CPG merchants' industry\n\n\n\n\n\n                  contacts and sales staffs. Under this program, Excite and                   each CPG merchant would develop co-branded Web pages on the                   Excite Network that would promote the merchant's goods cr                   provide content of interest to Excite's users. Excite would                   run dual promotional efforts, one that sends consumers to                   each CPG merchant's co-branded area and a second that sends                   consumers to the portion of the Excite Network that promotes                   the entire CPG program. Excite and NetGrocer agree to                   negotiate in good faith to establish the terms and conditions                   for NetGrocer's participation in Excite's CPG program when                   and if launched.\n\n         b)       Excite currently plans to make available sponsorship                   opportunities on its WebCrawler Site (located at                   http://www.webcrawler.com) generally similar to the                   opportunity described by this Agreement, with the significant                   exception that merchants will not be granted category                   exclusivity or rights to exclude competitors on the                   WebCrawler Site. Excite and NetGrocer agree to negotiate in                   good faith to establish the terms and conditions for                   NetGrocer's participation in available sponsorship                   opportunities on the WebCrawler Site when and if launched.\n\n                                      -9-\n\n8.

Reseller shall not authorize anyone to reverse engineer, decompile, alter,  transfer, modify or create a derivative work from any of the Products, nor may Reseller itself engage in so doing.     (b) Reseller shall not make any representations or warranties regarding the use or operation of the Products other than those included in any  promotional materials provided by Diversinet and any Product documentation provided by Diversinet.     3. Term and Renewal  The term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and continue in effect for a period of five (5) years (the \"Initial Term\"), unless sooner  terminated in accordance with the provisions set out herein. Upon expiration of the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for  consecutive one (1) year periods, unless terminated by Reseller within sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or any renewal term,  as the case may be (the Initial Term and each renewal term, collectively, the \"Term\"). Any annual renewal would be subject to the payment, if  applicable, of the AMC as agreed to by the parties, however such AMC will not be less than the previous year AMC times 115%, payable in  applicable quarterly instalments.    4. Termination  (a) Either Party may terminate this Agreement:  (i) Upon thirty (30) days' written notice to Reseller if Reseller fails to make any AMC payment when due under this Agreement, or when  an audit, as set out in Section 13, by Diversinet reveals any under-payment for any payment due, and it is not paid within the thirty (30)  day written notice period;   (ii) providing thirty (60) days' written notice to the other Party if the other Party breaches any material term or condition of this Agreement,  and fails to cure such breach within the 60 day period;  (iii) upon providing thirty (30) days' written notice to Reseller if Reseller terminates the provisions of the Annual Minimum Commitment  and fails to meet the sales targets as set out in Schedule 3.    (b) This Agreement shall terminate automatically without notice and without further action by Diversinet in the event that:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) Reseller ceases carrying on its business, or if a petition shall be filed, an order shall be made or an effective resolution is passed for the  winding-up, dissolution or liquidation of Reseller.    (c) Termination under Subsection 4(a) shall trigger a phase-out period during which Reseller may continue to provide products and  services to Customers. Such phase-out period shall be the longer of (i) the remaining term of the agreement between the Reseller and its  Customers, and (ii) 18 months.    (d) Upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason: (1) all rights granted to Reseller hereunder shall automatically come to an  end and revert to Diversinet, including without limitation any right to use, operate and provide customer service or support for the Products;  (2) Reseller shall immediately pay to Diversinet all amounts due and outstanding hereunder as of the date of such termination or expiration;  and (3) within five (5) days of termination of this Agreement, for whatever reason, Reseller, must: (a) destroy all copies of the Products and  any associated Products documentation in its possession or under its direct control; and (b) deliver to Diversinet a written certificate  warranting that it has complied with the foregoing obligations.    1. Customer Orders  (a) Customer Agreements. The Parties acknowledge and agree that Reseller's Customers will acquire the Products and related services under  contract with Reseller, that Diversinet shall not have any contractual interest in Reseller's Customer relationships. Prior to Reseller  committing to provide any Products to a Customer, Reseller shall cause Customer to enter into purchase agreement(s) with Reseller with  respect to each of the Products purchased by Customer (each, a \"Customer Agreement\"). Reseller agrees that it shall include terms and  conditions in its Customer Agreements that are sufficient to protect Diversinet's interests as reflected in this Agreement, including, but not  limited to, those terms set out in Schedule 4 hereto. Such Customer Agreements shall be subject to Diversinet's approval, which approval  shall not be unreasonably withheld. Reseller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all Customers abide by the terms of the  applicable Customer Agreement(s). Furthermore, Reseller shall enforce its Customer Agreements against Customer when requested to do so  by Diversinet. For greater clarity, Diversinet expects that the Reseller will include all of the points covered in Section 4 in its end user  agreement. When the Reseller receives a customer order they will fax both the end user agreement and the details of the order to Diversinet  and if the end user agreement contains all of the points outlined in Section 4 then Diversinet will approve the order and ship the required  products to the Reseller.    (b) Ordering Process. Reseller shall submit all orders to Diversinet for the applicable Products. Reseller's submission of orders to Diversinet  shall comply at all times with Diversinet's reasonable procedures and requirements and are subject to acceptance by Diversinet acting  reasonably. Reseller shall be solely responsible for all sales activity culminating in and including the procurement of fully-executed Customer  Agreements and purchase orders specifying the Products and Services ordered and the specific number of tokens.     1. Delivery  (a) Subject to Reseller's compliance with the terms and procedures set forth in this Agreement, Diversinet shall provide to Reseller or to  Customers the Products properly ordered by Reseller and accepted by Diversinet in material compliance with the applicable terms hereof,  notwithstanding any inconsistent or additional terms which Reseller includes in any Customer agreement.    (b) Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, delivery of the Products shall take place via electronic transmission or by courier, and will take  place within two (2) Business Days of a written request or purchase order for software and within five (5) Business Days for a standard  appliance. Custom built appliances or software are subject to evaluation and delivery date will be communicated after assessment. \"Business  Day\" shall mean 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time), Monday through Friday, excluding all statutory holidays observed in the  Province of Ontario in Canada. Delivery will be F.O.B. Diversinet's facility. Reseller shall have fifteen (15) calendar days after the later of (i)  the delivery of any of the Products by Diversinet; or (ii) any applicable evaluation period; to inspect the Products and ensure their  substantial compliance with the corresponding documentation. Unless Reseller notifies Diversinet within such fifteen (15) day period that  any of the Products fail to substantially comply with the relevant documentation, such Products shall be deemed accepted. In the event  Reseller rejects any of the Products, Reseller shall give Diversinet written notice of rejection, specifying in reasonable detail the basis for  such rejection. Diversinet will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct any nonconformance and re-deliver such Products to Reseller.    1. Reseller Covenants  (a) Manner of Performance. Reseller shall: (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to market and sell the Products and Services to Customers;  (ii) conduct business in a competent and professional manner that reflects favorably at all times on the Products and the goodwill and  reputation of Diversinet; (iii) avoid deceptive, misleading, or unethical practices that are or might be detrimental to Diversinet or the  Products, or to the public in general; (iv) not make any false or misleading representations with regard to Diversinet or to the Products; (v)  not publish or employ, or cooperate in the publication or employment of, any misleading or deceptive advertising material with regard to  Diversinet or the Products or related services; (vi) not make any representation, warranties or guarantees to potential Customers or to the  trade with respect to the specifications, features or capabilities of the Products that are inconsistent with published statements made by  Diversinet; and (vii) comply with all applicable federal, state, region, and local laws and regulations related to the performance of its duties  hereunder.     (b) Reporting Requirements. Reseller shall, on a monthly basis, communicate to Diversinet information about Customers as reasonably  requested by Diversinet including, but not limited to, Customer business, marketing, sales and technical information, installation, service  delivery and on-going maintenance information.    (c) Technical Expertise. Reseller and its staff shall be conversant with the technical language conventional to the Products and similar  technologies in general, and will develop sufficient knowledge of the industry, of the Products and of products competitive with the  Products (including specifications, features and benefits) in order to explain in detail to potential Customers and End Users the differences  between the Products and competitive products and services.    (d) Branding. Reseller may provide its own branding for the Products; however Reseller will include a \"powered by Diversinet\" tag or such  similar identifiers as mutually agreed to by the Parties. Should Reseller require Diversinet to brand the Product, then such work will be  done under a separate statement of work to be agreed upon in writing by the Parties.     1. Fees and Billing\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Rates. For the Diversinet Products sold or distributed by Reseller, Reseller shall pay Diversinet the applicable list price, in U.S. dollars, for  such Product, less the applicable discount for each Product, all as set out in Schedule 3. Any reference to any amounts or currency in this  Agreement means United States dollars or U.S. dollars.    (b) Billing. Diversinet will invoice Reseller for applicable one time Token Fees and the upfront annual Validation and Support Fee upon setting  up a master account for each Customer and pre-loading it with MobiSecure tokens. Other fees and charges payable under this Agreement  will be invoiced to Reseller according to terms set out in this Agreement or any applicable schedules or attachments hereto. Reseller shall be  responsible for payment to Diversinet of all invoiced amounts for Products and services provided by Diversinet at Reseller's request to  Reseller, its Customers and/or End-Users.     (c) Payment Terms. Invoices are due and payable within 30 calendar days from the invoice date or from when the amount is due, whichever is  later.    (d) Late Charges and Taxes. All overdue amounts shall bear interest at the rate of 1% per month (12% per annum, simple interest), or the  highest rate allowed by applicable law, whichever is less, until paid in full. Interest shall accrue on a daily basis. Fees do not include any  sales, transfer, use, property, value added and other taxes, or any customs duties, tariffs or other governmental charges, all of which (if any  are due and have been incurred within the Territory) are assumed and payable by Reseller (except for taxes imposed on Diversinet's net  income). Providing proof of an exemption from any such duty, tax or charge is the responsibility of Reseller. Diversinet acknowledges and  agrees that Reseller shall withhold any applicable non-resident withholding taxes from any amount owing hereunder and remit such taxes to  the applicable federal taxing authority without provision for gross-up, if Diversinet becomes a non-resident of Canada or assigns the  Agreement to a non-resident of Canada and if Diversinet does not provide Reseller with an appropriate exemption thereto.    (e) Network Charges. The Customer or End User shall at all times be responsible for all mobile network data, roaming or airtime charges, SMS  related charges, application certification charges or marketing costs and any other fees or levies related to the cellular or wireless network  over which the Products are offered and/or provisioned, as well as Customer's own Internet access fees (collectively, the \"Network  Charges\"). None of the fees chargeable hereunder include any Network Charges and Reseller shall ensure that Customer shall indemnify  and hold harmless Diversinet and Reseller against any such Network Charges that may be levied against them for the operation of the  Products.    1. Training and Consulting  (a) Diversinet will arrange for the initial personal technical and sales instruction of up to three (3) Reseller personnel for up to five (5) days in  learning the functions, installation, integration, operation and maintenance of the Products. Such instruction shall take place in Diversinet's  corporate headquarters and expenses of the Reseller personnel incurred for attending such initial instruction shall be paid by Reseller. There will be no charge for this initial training. Thereafter, Diversinet will make available to Reseller standard Product training courses  generally offered by Diversinet at the list price.    (a) Upon Reseller's request, Diversinet will provide Reseller with pre-sales consulting and post-sales consulting at the Diversinet's standard  rates. Post-sales consulting will be provided under a separate services agreement to be entered into by the Parties, which shall include  specific statement(s) of work.    (b) Statements of Work (\"SOW\"). Fees for any future development services shall be as agreed to by the Parties in an SOW. Reimbursable  expenses agreed to by Reseller shall be paid by Reseller within thirty (30) days of Diversinet's documented invoice. Diversinet shall offer to  perform such work at Diversinet's then standard daily rate (currently at $1,500 per day). Reseller hereby agrees and acknowledges that  Diversinet shall own all code, documentation and modifications to the code or documentation, and all copyrights, trade secrets and other  intellectual property rights with respect to any such code or documentation. Diversinet hereby agrees and acknowledges that Reseller owns  any and all intellectual property rights with respect to any Reseller-specific private label associated with the software.     1.

Diversinet  may also provide internet connectivity, by being responsible for network operation and availability from the public Internet up to the  termination cables at the network interface card on the server hardware. Diversinet shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain  connectivity, through the public Internet, between the server hardware and the wireless network operators or other network on which an End  User's device operates. Diversinet specifically excludes any responsibility for any connectivity between a network operator and a wireless  device, including any SMS, SMTP, or other connectivity. The products, their related service objectives and each Party's related  responsibilities in respect thereto are to be more fully described in a separate agreement.    (b) Service Term. During the Term, and subject to Reseller's payment of the annual Support Fees, Diversinet will provide support for the  Products in accordance with the terms set out in Schedule 5. Furthermore, Diversinet will support the existing Reseller trial including Apple  App Store submission until December 31, 2010. Diversinet will support the Reseller certification with Canada Health Infoway, at no additional  cost, until December 31, 2010.     (c) Standard Support. Reseller's Customers will be responsible for first level support to End-Users. Reseller will be responsible for second level  support to its Customer. Diversinet will provide third level support to Reseller. Diversinet will accept electronic mail messages via the Internet  using SMTP compliant software (\"E Mail\") addressed to: support@diversinet.com, from Reseller with questions regarding the functions of  the Products, as well as questions about how to make full use of the software (\"Support Questions\"). If second level support is not being  provided by the Reseller, Diversinet may, at its sole discretion, provide additional support to Reseller. In these cases, Diversinet may charge  the Reseller for support services or reduce the product price discount provided to Reseller.     Reseller's Support Questions must be referred to Diversinet by a single person, designated initially as Primary Technical Support Contact  (\"Primary Contact\")  set out in Schedule 1, unless Diversinet is notified in writing of an alternate technical support contact (\"Alternate  Contact\"). The names and e-mail addresses of up to four (4) Alternate Contacts (along with the name of the particular project or department)  shall be designated in a list provided by the Primary Contact via E Mail at support@diversinet.com. All Primary Contacts and Alternate  Contacts (collectively, \"Contacts\")  must be members of the designated project or department. It is Reseller's responsibility to provide\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversinet with an initial list of Contacts and to keep that list current in order to receive timely service.    (d) Updates. During the Term, Diversinet will provide updated versions of the Products (\"Updates\"). Updates shall be designated by a version  number with a higher number to the right of the decimal point (e.g., version 1.4 is an Update to version 1.2), but do not include New Releases  or Custom Releases (which are designated with a higher number to the left of the decimal point, or at the end with a letter, respectively). Prior  to delivering any Updates, Diversinet may require Reseller to sign a revised schedule if any additional grants or licenses are required for an  Update.     (e) Internet Access. Diversinet may provide, at no additional cost, access to Diversinet's Internet-based Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ's)  archives, a defect 'fix' list, or a private discussion forum available to all Products support customers, which will be moderated by Diversinet's  engineers when available.    (f) Beta Versions. Diversinet may provide Reseller with access to Beta Test versions of Updates to Products as described in paragraph (d)  above.    (g) Update Input. Diversinet will give special consideration to Reseller's feature requests for future versions of the Products.    1. ASP Sales  The Reseller may sell the Products as an Application Service Provider (\"ASP\") sales model. Under an ASP model, the Reseller shall provide the  Products through computer-based services to End Users over a network. The Reseller shall be responsible for providing, at the Reseller's sole cost  and expense, the infrastructure, network, hosting environment, support and/or website. Reseller warrants and guarantees that Diversinet shall  have no obligations, representations or guarantees to the End User for sales made by the Reseller under an ASP sale.    2. Confidential Information  (a) Reseller agrees that all software, documentation and materials provided with the Products and all information contained therein is owned by  Diversinet. The Parties agree that any other information of a confidential or proprietary nature provided by one Party to the other from time  to time, whether marked as \"Proprietary\",  \"Confidential\",  \"Secret\"  or any other designation implying confidentiality, is owned by the  disclosing Party (all such information hereafter, collectively \"Trade Secrets\"). Both Parties shall treat the other Party's Trade Secrets with  the same care as they treat their own confidential information of a like nature, but in no case shall the receiving Party use less care in  handling the Trade Secrets than would be reasonable under the circumstances. The Parties agree not to make the other Party's Trade  Secrets available in any form to any third party, or use the other Party's Trade Secrets for any purpose other than as set forth in this  Agreement or as authorized by the other Party in writing. The Parties' obligations under this subsection shall survive the termination or  expiration of this Agreement.    (b) General Exclusions: The Parties' obligations set out in this section shall not apply to any information which is:  (i) rightfully in a Party's possession before receipt from the other Party;  (ii) independently developed by a Party without reference to the other Party's Trade Secrets;  (iii) approved for release by written agreement with the other Party;  (iv) rightfully in the public domain;  (v) disclosed by requirement of a governmental agency or third party as expressly required by operation of law, regulation or court order. The disclosing Party shall promptly notify the other Party of the pending disclosure to allow the other Party to seek a protective order;  or  (vi) lawfully disclosed to a Party by a third party without an obligation of confidentiality to the Party.    (c) It is expressly agreed that a violation of this section will cause irreparable harm to the owning Party and that a remedy at law would be  inadequate. Therefore, in addition to any and all other remedies available at law, the owning Party shall be entitled to seek (without posting  of a bond) preliminary, injunctive, emergency or equitable relief in the event of any actual or threatened violation of any or all of the  provisions hereof.    3. Audit  During the Term and for seven (7) years after the expiration or termination of this Agreement, or such longer period as required by applicable law,  Reseller agrees to maintain complete books, records and accounts relevant to the computation of and accounting for the amounts payable under  this Agreement. Reseller agrees to allow Diversinet or its agents and representatives the right to examine and audit such books, records and  accounts during Reseller's normal business hours for no more than once per calendar quarter upon reasonable notice. If such examination reveals  a deficiency in any amounts paid, Reseller agrees to pay any such deficiency forthwith upon demand, plus interest calculated in accordance with  Section (Late Charges and Taxes) above and, if in excess of 5%, the cost of the audit incurred by Diversinet.    4. Limited Warranty  EACH PARTY DOES NOT WARRANT TO THE OTHER THAT THE MATERIALS IT PROVIDES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT  WILL MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE OTHER PARTY OR ITS CUSTOMERS, OR THAT THEIR OPERATION WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED  OR ERROR FREE.     Diversinet warrants as follows:  (a) Each of the Products operates in substantial accordance with its documentation (\"Operation Warranty\"). With respect to the Operation  Warranty, Reseller's sole remedy, and Diversinet's sole obligation, shall be to cause the Product to operate substantially in accordance with  its documentation in a timely manner. All Products shall be virus-checked prior to delivery to Reseller.    (b) The services provided under this Agreement shall be performed in a timely and professional manner by personnel (\"Personnel\") and in all  material respects in accordance with the requirements set forth here in Schedule 5 (Service Level Agreement). Personnel shall be  appropriately trained in the performance of such services under this Agreement and shall meet those standards generally observed by  reputable and competent members of the same industry providing similar services.     c) Diversinet shall ensure that there collectively is a sufficient number of employees and personnel assigned and available during the term to  provide the services in accordance with the service levels and the standards and other terms and conditions of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n  (d) Diversinet shall exercise professional and good judgement in carrying out and performing its obligations under this Agreement.    (e) The Products do not contain any virus, Trojan horse, worm, trapdoor, backdoor, malicious code or other code or device designed to  interfere with proper use of the Software or cause harm or injury.    (h) As of the Effective Date, to the best of its knowledge, none of the Products infringes upon any third party's patent rights (\"Limited Patent  Warranty\").    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH ABOVE, DIVERSINET PROVIDES THE PRODUCTS, DOCUMENTATION AND OTHER RELATED  SERVICES (COLLECTIVELY, THE \"BUNDLED PRODUCT\")  TO RESELLER \"AS IS\"  WITHOUT WARRANTY, MAKES NO OTHER  WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY OTHER WARRANTIES OF PERFORMANCE, AND  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NON INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, REGARDING THE  BUNDLED PRODUCTS, EITHER AS A UNIT, OR AS INDIVIDUAL PARTS. EXCEPT AS ABOVE SET FORTH, DIVERSINET SHALL BEAR NO  RISK AS TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BUNDLED PRODUCT, AND ALL RISK IS TO BE ALLOCATED BETWEEN RESELLER AND IT  CUSTOMERS AND END-USERS, OR ANY OTHERS WHO USE THE BUNDLED PRODUCT (\"USERS\"). EXCEPT AS ABOVE SET FORTH,  SHOULD THE BUNDLED PRODUCT PROVE DEFECTIVE, DIVERSINET SHALL NOT BEAR ANY COST WHATSOEVER FOR ANY SERVICE,  REPAIR OR CORRECTION TO ANY PARTY. USERS SHALL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ADEQUATELY PROTECTING DATA USED IN  CONNECTION WITH THE BUNDLED PRODUCT. EXCEPT AS ABOVE SET FORTH, DIVERSINET SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST  DATA, RERUN TIME, INACCURATE INPUT, WORK DELAYS OR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF SECURITY FOR PROPRIETARY DATA OR ANY  OTHER INJURIES OR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM USE OF THE BUNDLED PRODUCT.    Neither Diversinet, nor its subsidiaries, nor their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, assignees, co-developers, servants and  contractors, nor the Reseller has any right to make any other representation, warranty or promise of any kind with respect to any of the Products. This Agreement does not, in itself, grant any patent license or patent right of any manner or kind. Reseller will be solely responsible for  determining which patent rights it may need to use the Products and for obtaining such licenses, where applicable. So long as the terms of this  agreement are respected, Diversinet agrees that it will not bring any suit, claim or demand against Reseller, its Customers or End-Users for breach  of Diversinet's patent rights in the Products, if any.    5. Limitation of Liability and Damages  (a) EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT DIRECT FORESEEABLE DAMAGES, IN NO EVENT SHALL DIVERSINET BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,  SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR  LOSSES) AS A RESULT OF THE USE, SALE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE BUNDLED PRODUCT, WHETHER BY WAY OF A LEGAL  THEORY OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER THEORY,  EVEN IF DIVERSINET HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.     (b) RESELLER WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO RECEIVE ANY COMPENSATION OR REPARATIONS ON TERMINATION OR  EXPIRATION OF THIS AGREEMENT UNDER THE LAW OF THE TERRITORY OR OTHERWISE, OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY  PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS SECTION HAS BEEN INCLUDED AS A MATERIAL  INDUCEMENT FOR DIVERSINET TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT DIVERSINET WOULD NOT HAVE ENTERED INTO  THIS AGREEMENT BUT FOR THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AS SET FORTH HEREIN.    (c) The availability of the MobiSecure\u2122 Strong Authentication service depends on many factors, including Customer's connection to the  Internet, End Users' connection to the Internet, the availability of the Internet and the Internet backbone and equipment that, by its nature,  is not fault tolerant. Diversinet does not and cannot control the flow of data to or from Diversinet's network and other portions of the  Internet. Such flow depends in large part on the performance of Internet services provided or controlled by third parties. At times, actions or  inaction of such third parties can impair or disrupt Customers' connections to the Internet (or portions thereof). Although Diversinet will use  commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions it deems appropriate to remedy and avoid such events, Diversinet cannot guarantee that  such events will not occur. Accordingly, Diversinet shall have no responsibility for any failure to meet the requirements hereunder, with  respect to performance issues, including without limitation: (i) caused by factors outside of Diversinet's reasonable control; (ii) that result  from any actions or omissions of Customers, End Users or any third parties; (iii) that result from Customers' equipment and/or third party  equipment (not within the sole control of Diversinet); (iv) caused by any act or failure to act by Customer or as a result of any Third Party  Software.    (d) NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, IN NO EVENT SHALL DIVERSINET'S LIABILITY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT (OR THE  BUNDLED PRODUCT) EXCEED ONE HUNDRED PERCENT (100%) OF THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE LICENSE FEES, ROYALTIES  AND SUPPORT FEES PAID BY RESELLER IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE EVENT OR CIRCUMSTANCE  GIVING RISE TO THE ALLEGED LIABILITY ON THE PART OF DIVERSINET.     (e) The limitations set forth in Section 15(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) shall not apply in respect of (i) breach of confidentiality obligations; (ii) breach  of privacy provisions as detailed in Schedule 6; (iii) the intellectual property indemnity; (iv) any Abandonment committed by Diversinet; or  (v) any willful gross misconduct (including fraud). \"Abandonment\" means Diversinet's cessation or suspension of, or refusal to perform, its  obligations under this Agreement, and such cessation, suspension or refusal (i) was knowingly intended by Diversinet to cause harm to  Reseller, and (ii) was not the result of a termination of this Agreement by Diversinet in accordance with Section 4 (Termination).    1. Indemnification  (a) Reseller Indemnity. Reseller shall indemnify and hold harmless Diversinet and/or any of its directors, officers, agents, employees,  contractors, parent companies, affiliates, and/or subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Diversinet Parties\") from and against any claim, suit or  proceeding by a third party based on or arising out of (i) the acts or omissions of Reseller in connection with its performance or failure  to perform any other obligations in this Agreement or any agreement with a Customer, and (ii) any unauthorized representation or any  misrepresentation of fact to any third party with respect to one or more of the Diversinet Parties or Products made by Reseller or any  director, officer, agent, or employee of Reseller, provided that:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) Diversinet promptly notifies Reseller in writing of any such claim and Reseller has sole control of any related investigation,  defense and settlement negotiations; and  (ii) Diversinet fully cooperates with Reseller, at Reseller's expense, in defending or settling such claim.    (b) Infringement Indemnity. Diversinet shall diligently defend, indemnify and hold Reseller harmless, at its own expense, any action, loss,  cost or expense brought against Reseller to the extent that it is based upon a claim that Reseller's use of the unmodified Products as  permitted herein infringes upon a third party's intellectual property rights, and will pay the resulting costs, damages and legal fees  finally awarded against Reseller through settlement, judgment, arbitration, mediation or otherwise in such action that are attributable to  such claim, provided that:    (i) Reseller promptly notifies Diversinet in writing of any such claim under patent law and Diversinet has sole control of any related  investigation, defense and settlement negotiations; and  (ii) Reseller fully cooperates with Diversinet, at Diversinet's expense, in defending or settling such claim.    (c) Should any of the Products become, or in Diversinet's sole opinion is likely to become, the subject of any third party intellectual  property infringement claim, Reseller shall permit Diversinet, at Diversinet's sole option and expense, to:    (i) procure for Reseller the right to continue to use such Product; or   (ii) modify such Product so that it becomes non-infringing;     (d) Diversinet shall have no liability for any claim based upon:    (i) use of other than a current or the last prior release to the current unaltered version of the Products; or  (ii) use, operation or combination of the Products with non-Diversinet programs, data, equipment or documentation in a manner not  reasonably contemplated by this Agreement, if such infringement would have been avoided but for such uses, operation, or  combination; or   (iii) Reseller's or its agent's activities after Diversinet has notified Reseller that such use may result in infringement provided that the  Reseller has been provided with access to an updated version that would not be infringing.    (e) THE FOREGOING STATES OUT THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF DIVERSINET, AND THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF  RESELLER AND END-USER, WITH RESPECT TO THE INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS BY THE  PRODUCTS.    2. Escrow Agreement  The Parties agree to execute an escrow agreement, within 90 days of the Effective Date, with a nationally recognized escrow agent with respect to  the source code for the Products and name Reseller as a beneficiary. Diversinet will then immediately send a copy of the escrow agreement to  Reseller for its counter-signature. Diversinet shall, at least annually, deposit the source code in the escrow account. Costs associated with the  escrow agreement shall be borne by Reseller. Reseller will be provided with a copy of any deposit correspondence and escrow agent's acceptance  thereof. The escrow agreement shall provide, among other terms, that the source code shall be released to Reseller if any of the following events  (collectively the \"Release Conditions\") occurs:    (i) Diversinet ceases to support services at levels as stated in Schedule 5 under this Agreement that is not remedied within  sixty (60) days after receipt of written notice of such failure;   (ii) Diversinet makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or becomes subject to direct control of a trustee, receiver or  similar authority, or Diversinet becomes subject to any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding under federal or state  statutes; or  (iii) Diversinet suspends or ceases to carry on its business and a receiver, trustee or assignee does not carry on the  business.    3. Non-Solicitation  During the Term, the Reseller agrees that it shall not induce any person employed by Diversinet to leave Diversinet's employ to become an  employee of Reseller or its agents or contractors.    4. Relationship  Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed so as to create a joint venture, partnership, employer/employee, franchisor/franchisee or  principal/agent relationship between the Parties. Reseller and Diversinet are independent contracting parties. Neither Reseller nor its employees,  consultants, contractors or agents have any authority to bind Diversinet by contract or otherwise to any obligation.     5. Choice of Forum  This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the province of Ontario, Canada, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Any litigation  or other dispute resolution between the Parties relating to this Agreement or its construction shall take place in the courts of Toronto, Ontario,  Canada. The Parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the provincial and federal courts therein. The Parties agree that the  United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement.

The MobiSecure\u00ae Vault server is designed to host  and manage a variety of different types of personal information e.g. financial, health, identities and passwords. It provides a framework for  administrators to define and customize the information to be hosted and managed and supports a plug-in architecture and web service interfaces  to allow for rapid integration with external information, payment and messaging systems.     MobiSecure\u00ae Wallet application works in conjunction with the MobiSecure\u00ae vault server. It is designed to run on desktop computers and mobile  platforms including Java based phones, RIM Blackberries\u00ae,  Microsoft Windows Mobile\u00ae,  iPhone, Android and BREW devices. The Wallet  application provides offline and online access to personal information. Information is stored in the device for instant and offline access securely  using a patented technique. The information is synchronized automatically or upon user's request with the vault server using a secure data  synchronization protocol. Users may use the wallet application to access their information instantly when they are traveling, retrieve additional  information from the vault server or send their information to others via email, SMS or fax. The wallet application includes an embedded software  One-Time-Password (OTP) token to allow for secure and easy access to the vault server using dynamic password based authentication.     The MobiSecure\u00ae Wallet SDK and MobiSecure\u00ae Vault API allows customers and third party developers to build secure mobile applications by  leveraging Diversinet's Wallet secure container services.    Applications features and benefits (utilizing Wallet and Vault) include:  Patient Portal  The Patient Portal is a set of web pages designed to permit patients to display, add, delete and update information pertaining to their  demographics, attending physicians, chronic conditions, allergies, immunizations and messages received from registered doctors and clinical  staff.    The Physician's Tool  This is a windows based application which permits doctors and authorized 'circle of care'  workers to access patient records stored in the  information repository. These users may add, delete or update the patient records and may also 'Validate' existing records. Validation consists  of marking the records as 'Validated' and making them read only from that point to maintain record values that the physician has agreed to by  validating the record.    The Physician's Tool also can create and display secured messages to the patient which will be protected by the Diversinet MobiSecure\u00ae Health platform. The tool can also display a complete record of messages sent to the patient with associated time and date of acknowledgment  from the patient. The administrator users of the tool can also add and delete doctors and other circle of care worker accounts in order to  administer the operation of the clinical side of the Diversinet Platform.    Message Manager  The Message Manager is a tool used to collect and display incoming patient messages to the clinic and answer's to previously sent  questions from the clinic. The Message Manager permits the user to prepare reply messages as well as automatically preparing an audit trail of  all display and reply activities.    Message Generator  The Message Generator is an extension of the messaging tool in the Physician's Tool above, used to create user reminder messages based  upon reminder criteria and the user records in the repository for recurring action requirements. Examples include recurring tests (i.e. PAP,  colonoscopy, recurring blood work supporting medications), reminders about health and lifestyle choices, medication reminders.)     2.

Licensor hereby designates International Management, Inc., IMG Center, 1360 East 9th Street, Suite 100, Cleveland, Ohio 44114, Attention: Charley Moore as its authorized agent for all purposes hereunder. All notices or submissions to be made or delivered by Company to Licensor pursuant to this Agreement shall be delivered to said address free of all charges such as, for example, shipping charges and customs charges. In the event that any such charges are paid by Licensor or by its authorized agent, Company agrees to make prompt reimbursement.\n\n         11. DEFAULT. (a) If either party at any time during the Contract Period shall (i) fail to make any payment of any sum of money herein specified to be made, or (ii) fail to observe or&bbsp;perform any of the covenants, agreements or obligations hereunder (other than the payment of money), the nondefaulting party may terminate this Agreement as follows: as to (i) if such payment is not made within ten (10) days after the defaulting party shall have received written notice of such failure to make payment, or as to (ii) if such default is not cured within thirty (30) days after the defaulting party shall have received written notice specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such default. In order to be a sufficient notice hereunder, any such written notice shall specify in detail each item of default and shall specify the provision of this Agreement which applies to each item of default, and shall specify in detail the action the defaulting party is required to take in order to cure each item of default. The termination rights set forth in this section shall not constitute the exclusive remedy of the nondefaulting party hereunder, however, and if default is made by either party hereunder, the other may resort to such other remedies as said party would have been entitled to if this section had been omitted from this Agreement, subject to the terms of this Agreement. Termination under the provisions of this section shall be without prejudice to any rights or claims which the terminating party may otherwise have against the defaulting party, and if Company is the defaulting party, Company shall be responsible for any and all payments due under the terms of this Agreement in addition to other liabilities set forth above.\n\n         (b) If Company shall become bankrupt or insolvent, or if Company's business shall be placed in the hands of a receiver, assignee or trustee, whether by voluntary act of Company or otherwise, the Contract Period shall, at the election of Licensor, immediately terminate.\n\n                                      -5-\n\n\n\n\n\n         12. USE OF DUVAL IDENTIFICATION AFTER TERMINATION. From and after the termination of the Contract Period all of the rights of Company to the use of the Duval Identification shall cease absolutely and Company shall not thereafter use or refer to the Duval Identification in advertising or promotion in any manner whatsoever. It is further agreed that following termination of the Contract Period, Company shall not advertise, promote, distribute or sell any item whatsoever in connection with the use of any name, figure, design, logo, trademark or trade name similar to or suggestive of the Duval Identification.\n\n         13. TRADEMARKS. Company agrees that it will not file, during the Contract Period or thereafter, any application for trademark registration or otherwise obtain or attempt to obtain ownership of any trademark or trade name within the Contract Territory or in any other country of the world which consists of the Duval Identification or any mark, design or logo intended to make reference to Duval or to identify products endorsed by Duval. In the event that, prior to commencement of the Contract Period, Company has filed one or more applications for registration of any such trademark, or otherwise has obtained any rights to such trademark, Company agrees to cause such applications and/or trademarks to be assigned and transferred to Licensor forthwith.\n\n         14. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. All rights not herein specifically granted to Company shall remain the property of Licensor to be used in any manner Licensor deems appropriate. Company understands that Licensor has reserved the right to authorize others to use Duval Identification within the Contract Territory and during the Contract Period in connection with all tangible and intangible items and services other than Products themselves.\n\n         15. INDEMNITY. Company agrees to protect, indemnify and save harmless Licensor, Duval and their authorized agent, or any of them, from and against any and all expenses, damages, claims, suits, actions, judgments and costs whatsoever, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of, or in any way connected with, actions or omissions of Company, any advertising material furnished by, or on behalf of, Company or any claim or action for personal injury, death or other cause of action involving alleged defects in Company's Products or services. Company agrees to provide and maintain, at its own expense, general commercial and product liability insurance with limits no less than Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) and naming Licensor and Duval as additional named insureds. Within thirty (30) days from the date hereof, Company will submit to Licensor evidence of such policy, requiring that the insurer shall not terminate or materially modify such without written notice to Licensor at least twenty (20) days in advance thereof.\n\n         16. SPECIAL RIGHT OF TERMINATION. Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Licensor if the commercial value of the Duval Identification is substantially reduced because Duval (i) has engaged in illegal or immoral conduct resulting in a felony conviction; or (ii) fails an officially sanctioned drug test or is criminally convicted of any drug related offense. Any termination pursuant to this paragraph shall become effective on the 30th day next following the date of receipt by Licensor of Company's written notice to so terminate.\n\n                                      -6-\n\n         17. LIMITED LIABILITY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event Company incurs any expenses, damages or other liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) in connection with the performance or non-performance of any term or provision hereof, Licensor's liability to Company shall not exceed the remuneration, excluding reimbursement of expenses, actually paid to Licensor by Company. In no event will Licensor be liable for any indirect, incidental, reliance, special or consequential damages arising out of the performance or non-performance of this Agreement, whether or not Licensor had been advised of the possibility of such damages. It is understood that Duval is not a party hereto and has no liability hereunder but is an intended specific third party creditor beneficiary hereof.\n\n         18. WAIVER. The failure of either party at any time or times to demand strict performance by the other of any of the terms, covenants or conditions set forth herein shall not be construed as a continuing waiver or relinquishment thereof and each may at any time demand strict and complete performance by the other of said terms, covenants and conditions. Any waiver of such rights must be set forth in writing.\n\n         19. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement shall be declared illegal, invalid, void or unenforceable by any judicial or administrative authority, the validity of any other provision and of the entire Agreement shall not be affected thereby.\n\n         20. ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of Licensor, and the successors and assigns of Licensor. The rights granted Company hereunder are personal to it, shall be used only by it or its affiliate and shall not without the prior written consent of Licensor be transferred or assigned to any other party. In the event of the merger or consolidation of Company with any other entity, Licensor shall have the right to terminate the Contract Period by so notifying Company in writing within sixty (60) days following Licensor's receipt of notice of such merger or consolidation.\n\n         21. ARBITRATION/GOVERNING LAW. This agreement shall be governed by, and its provisions enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Ohio, without regard to its principals of conflicts of laws. In the event a dispute arises under this agreement which cannot be resolved, such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration and resolved by a single arbitrator (who shall be a lawyer not employed by or associated with either party to this agreement) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. All such arbitration shall take place at the office\n\n\n\n\n\nof the American Arbitration Association located in Cleveland, Ohio. Each party is entitled to depose one (1) fact witness and any expert witness retained by the other party, and to conduct such other discovery as the arbitrator deems appropriate. The award or decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive and judgment may be entered upon such award by any court.\n\n         22. SIGNIFICANCE OF HEADINGS. Section headings contained herein are solely for the purpose of&bbsp;aiding in speedy location of subject matter and are not in any sense to be given weight in the construction of this Agreement. Accordingly, in case of any question with respect to the\n\n                                      -7-\n\nconstruction of this Agreement, it is to be construed as though such section headings had been omitted.\n\n         23. NO JOINT VENTURE. This Agreement does not constitute and shall not be construed as constituting an association, partnership, joint venture or relationship of principal and agent or employer and employee between Licensor and Company. Neither party shall have any right to obligate or bind the other party in any manner whatsoever, and, except as expressly set forth herein, nothing herein contained shall give, or is intended to give, any rights of any kind to any third person.\n\n         24.
