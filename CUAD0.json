The term of this  Agreement  shall be ten (10)                            years (the \"Term\")  which shall  commence on the date                            upon which the Company  delivers to  Distributor  the                            last Sample, as defined  hereinafter.

In                            order  to  maintain  the  exclusive  rights  to sell,                            lease, distribute and service Products in the Market,                            the Distributor must use all commercially  reasonably                            efforts to purchase for sale to  subdistributors  the                            following minimum quantities of the Products from the                            Company:\n\n         On the  commencement of the Term  Distributor will issue to the Company an  irrevocable  letter of credit (\"LC\") in the amount of Five Hundred  Thousand Dollars  ($500,000),  the form of which is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A and incorporated  herein by reference.  The LC shall have a two (2) month term,  and shall be renewed  for five (5)  consecutive  bimonthly  periods.  A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.  The Company may draw funds from the LC to pay for  Distributor's  purchases,  which are not paid according to the terms in Section 2.7. Prices for the EnergySaver units are\n\n                                    Page -2-\n\nprovided  by the  Company as Exhibit C. The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.       PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS\n\n         2.1      Orders.  The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.

Google shall not be restricted from selling, licensing, modifying, or otherwise  distributing the Products and/or the Google Trademarks to any third party.\n\n7.2 Google acknowledges that Distributor and/or its licensors own all right, title and interest, including all Intellectual Property Rights, in and  to the Distributor Apps and all [ * ] to [ * ]. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, Distributor shall not be [ * ]from [ * ], or  otherwise [ * ]the Distributor App(s) or other products of Distributor to [ * ].\n\n8. WARRANTIES\n\n8.1 Each party warrants to the other that it will use reasonable care and skill in complying with its obligations under this Agreement.  Distributor also represents and warrants that it will undertake commercially reasonable endeavours in good faith to comply with Google's  business partner due diligence process including providing requested information.\n\n  - 9 -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   *Confidential treatment requested  Google Confidential\n\n\n\n8.2 Google warrants that the Distribution Products will for a period of [ * ] from the date of their supply to Distributor be free from any defect  which has a materially adverse effect on their use or operation.\n\n8.3 If any of the warranties in Clause 8.1 or 8.2 is breached by Google, Distributor must tell Google as soon as possible. Distributor must give  Google a reasonable time to fix the problem and (if necessary) to supply Distributor with a corrected or replacement version of the  Distribution Product or a way to work-around the problem that is not materially detrimental to Distributor, or to re-perform any relevant  services. This will be done without any additional charge to Distributor. If Google is able to do this within a reasonable time, Google will  have no other obligations or liability in relation to that breach.\n\n8.4 Google will not be liable for breach of any of the warranties or other terms in this Agreement to the extent that the breach arises from:\n\n  (a) use of the Products other than in accordance with normal operating procedures;\n\n  (b) any alterations or maintenance to the Products done by anyone other than Google or someone authorised by Google;\n\n  (c) any problem with a computer on which the Products are installed, or with any equipment connected to that computer or any  other software which is installed on that computer;\n\n  (d) any abnormal or incorrect operating conditions; or\n\n  (e) use of the Products in combination with any other hardware or software, unless this use has been approved by Google in  writing.\n\n8.5 Distributor will comply with all applicable commercial and public anti-bribery laws, including, without limitation, the UK's Bribery Act  2010 and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (\"Anti-Bribery Laws\"), which prohibit (amongst other things) corrupt offers of  anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a government official to obtain or keep business. ''Government officials\" include any  government employee, candidate for public office, and employee of government-owned or government-controlled companies, public  international organisations, and political parties. Furthermore, Distributor will not make any facilitation payments, which are payments to  induce officials to perform routine functions they are otherwise obligated to perform.\n\n8.6 No conditions, warranties or other terms apply to the Products, [ * ] or to any other goods or services supplied under this Agreement  unless expressly set out in this Agreement. Subject to Clause 9.1, no implied conditions, warranties or other terms apply (including any  implied terms as to satisfactory quality, fitness for purpose or conformance with description).\n\n9.

If the amount referred to in (b) above cannot be calculated accurately at the time the relevant liability is to be  assessed (the \"Applicable Time\"), it shall be calculated on a pro-rata basis as X/Y x Z. Where:     X = the total sum paid and payable to the Distributor pursuant to Clause 4 in the relevant Contract Year prior to the Applicable Time;     Y = the number of days elapsed in the relevant Contract Year prior to the Applicable Time; and     Z = 365     *Confidential treatment requested  Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (c) breach of any implied condition as to title or quiet enjoyment; and\n\n  (d) misuse of confidential information.\n\n9.2 Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or limit either party's liability under Clause 10 (Indemnities), or Distributor's liability under Clause  2 (License Grants and Restrictions), Clause 3.5 (Exclusivity), Clause 3.6 (End User License Agreement) and Clause 3.7 (Accurate  Reproduction) or Clause [ * ].\n\n9.3 Subject to Clauses 9.1 and 9.2, neither party shall be liable under this Agreement (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) for any:\n\n  (a) loss of anticipated savings;\n\n  (b) loss of business opportunity (which for the avoidance of doubt shall not include loss of advertising revenue);\n\n  (c) loss of or corruption of data;\n\n  (d) loss or damage resulting from third party claims; or\n\n  (e) indirect or consequential losses;\n     suffered or incurred by the other party (whether or not such losses were within the contemplation of the parties at the date of this  Agreement).\n\n9.4 Subject to Clauses 9.1 and 9.2, each party's total liability under or in connection with this Agreement (whether in contract, tort or  otherwise) arising in any Contract Year is limited to the greater of:\n\n  (a) [ * ] Euros ([ * ] Euros); and\n\n  (b) [ * ]% of the total payment due to the Distributor in the relevant Contract Year pursuant to Clause 4 (Payment Terms).\n\n  - 11 -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   By Distributor.\n\n   User claim arising out of or resulting from such End Users use of any Distributor App(s), including any actions or claims in product  liability, tort, contract or equity.     *Confidential treatment requested  Google Confidential\n\n\n\n10.

Without limiting the preceding sentence, each of the following shall appear on the End User's desktop exactly as shown in  this Exhibit B: (i) the location and size of the Chrome Browser window and the Distributor App window, (ii) the z-order of the Distributor App and  the Chrome Browser, and (iii) the number and content of the tabs in the Chrome Browser (i.e., the Chrome Browser shall contain exactly two (2)  tabs, with the first tab set to google.com, and the second tab set to http://tools.google.com/chrome/intlfen-US/welcome.html (or such other url as  Google may specify). In no event shall the Chrome Browser window be minimized. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Distributor may modify the  content and design of the Distributor App window provided that Distributor complies with the other restrictions in this Agreement and obtains  Google's prior consent.     (d) The tabs in the Chrome Browser and the Omnibox shall be clearly visible to the End User as shown in this Exhibit B, regardless of the  resolution of the End User's monitor. In no event shall the tabs in the Chrome Browser or the Omnibox be hidden behind a Distributor App.     (e) Distributor shall implement (or, if implemented by Google, Distributor shall not modify) the six-month flag (i.e., the functionality that  prevents an End User from receiving more than one (1) offer for the Chrome Browser within any six (6)-month period) unless Google has provided  written confirmation (including by email) that the 6-months flag can be turned off. Note that this authorisation may be revoked at any time and  Distributor shall then include the 6 months flag again in future builds.\n\n\n\n  - 22 -\n\n\n\n\n\n  EXHIBIT C     Guidelines for Applications Bundled with Google Applications     Google has observed a significant increase in the number of reports of software that is engaging in deceptive, malicious and other annoying  practices that significantly diminish user perception and enjoyment of the internet. These practices include but are not limited to installing  software on computers without obtaining informed end user consent (the so-called \"drive-by download\"), inundating end users with  advertisements without adequate attribution or labeling, exposing users to pornographic material without obtaining informed end user consent,  obtaining or transmitting personal information about an end user without obtaining informed end user consent, and interfering with an end user's  ability to easily uninstall applications the end user does not wish to be on his or her computer.     Google does not wish to be associated with these types of practices. Accordingly, Google has developed the Guidelines set forth below to prevent  its trademark, other intellectual property, and services from being used in connection with these practices. Google believes that these Guidelines  are necessary to protect Google from any allegation that it has contributed to practices that might be viewed as unlawful or actionable; to preserve  the reputation of Google as a provider of trusted software and services in a manner that is beneficial and fair to users and other constituents; and  to stem the rising incidence of practices that harm users and diminish the perceived value and reliability of the internet, which are essential to  Google's business.     With this objective in mind, Google has established the following Guidelines to apply to customer Applications that are bundled with any Google  Application. Except to the extent Google has otherwise specifically agreed in writing, Google does not grant permission to, and you will not,  bundle any Application with a Google Application unless you ensure that any such Application specified in the agreement between you and  Google that incorporated these Guidelines complies with these Guidelines.     For the avoidance of doubt, by these Guidelines Google does not intend to, and does not, impose any restrictions on what you may do with any  Application that is not bundled with a Google Application, bundled with an Application that accesses Google services, or used to access Google  services; you remain free to sell any Application you wish (whether or not it complies with these Guidelines) so long as it is not bundled with a  Google Application, bundled with an Application that accesses Google services, or used to access Google services.     In these Guidelines: (a) \"you\" and \"your\" refer to the legal entity(ies) that has entered into the contract with Google into which these Guidelines  are incorporated, as well as any person or entity acting on your behalf; and (b) \"Application\" means any application, plug-in, helper, component or  other executable code that runs on a user's computer, examples of which include those that provide browser helper objects, instant messaging,  chat, email, data, file viewing, media playing, file sharing, games, internet navigation, search and other services.    Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  - 23 -\n\n\n\n\n\n   Google welcomes input about these Guidelines from you and from other interested parties, and is always willing to consider revisions as  appropriate to encourage innovation while protecting against deceptive, unfair and harmful practices. Accordingly, Google may update these  Guidelines, including the Attachments, from time to time as provided in Section 10 below.     If you have any questions about these Guidelines, please do not hesitate to discuss them with your Google account manager.     Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  - 24 -\n\n\n\n\n\n   1. General.     1.1 Approval and Ongoing Compliance. You may bundle Google Applications with Applications only to the extent permitted in the  signed written agreement into which these Guidelines have been incorporated. In such instance, you must ensure that your Application both (1)  has been approved by Google for the purpose of being bundled with Google Applications in writing in advance, and (2) complies at all times with  the requirements outlined herein. To obtain Google's approval for any Applications not expressly approved in your agreement, you must submit a  written request.     1.2 No Google Branding or Attribution. Your Application, and any related collateral material (including any Web pages promoting your  Application or from which your Application is made available), must not contain any Google branding, trademarks or attribution unless (and then  only to the extent) Google expressly consents otherwise in writing. In addition, queries entered into Applications may not resolve to a results page  that contains any Google branding, trademarks or attribution unless (and then only to the extent) Google expressly consents otherwise in writing.     2. Prohibited Content. You may not bundle any Google Application with an Application that: (a) contains any viruses, worms, trojan horses, or the  like; and (b) is distributed primarily for the purpose of (i) distributing pornographic, obscene, excessively profane, gambling-related, deceptive,  fraudulent or illegal content, or (ii) distributing content related to \"hacking\" or \"cracking.\"     3. Prohibited Behavior. You may not bundle any Google Application with an Application that engages in deceptive, unfair, harassing or otherwise  annoying practices. For example, the Application may not:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (a) use, or permit an unaffiliated person to use, an end user's computer system for any purpose not understood and  affirmatively consented to by the end user (including, without limitation, for purposes of consuming bandwidth or  computer resources, sending email messages, launching denial of service attacks, accruing toll charges through a dialer  or obtaining personal information from an end user's computer such as login, password, account or other information  personal to the end user);\n\n  (b) intentionally create or exploit any security vulnerabilities in end user computers;\n\n  (c) trigger pop-ups, pop-unders, exit windows, or similar obstructive or intrusive functionality, that materially interfere with  an end user's Web navigation or browsing or the use of his or her computer;\n\n  (d) repeatedly ask an end user to take, or try to deceive an end user into taking, an action that the end user has previously  declined to take (such as repeatedly asking an end user to change his or her home page or some other setting or  configuration);\n\n  - 25 -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   4. Disclosure and Consent.     4.1 Disclosure and Consent before Installation. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application unless you (and your  distribution and bundling partners, if applicable under the terms of the agreement between you and Google that incorporates these Guidelines)  design the installation of any such Application in a manner that ensures that it is installed by end users in a knowing and willful manner - e.g., no  \"drive-by' downloads or installs. By \"distribution partner\" we mean any third party who distributes your Application and by \"bundling partner\"  we mean any third party who installs your Application in combination with or alongside one or more other Applications. At a minimum, compliance  with this provision requires that, prior to installing your Application, you and any third party distributing or bundling your Application:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   4.2 Disclosure and Consent for Collection and Transmission of Personally Identifiable information. You may not bundle any Google  Application with any Application that (1) collects or transmits to any entity other than the end user personally identifiable information, or (2)  collects or transmits information related to a user's computer or Internet usage or activity in a manner that could collect or transmit such user's  personally identifiable information (such as through keystroke logging), unless prior to the first occurrence of any such collection or transmission  you:\n\n   Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (e) redirect browser traffic away from valid DNS entries (except that your Application may direct unresolved URLs to an  alternative URL designated by you, provided that the page to which the end user resolves adequately informs the end  user that you and your Application are the source of that page);\n\n  (f) interfere with the browser default search functionality (except that your Application may permit an end user to change  his or her default search engine with proper disclosure, consent and attribution as provided below); or\n\n  (g) engage in activity that violates any applicable Jaw or regulation.\n\n  (a) first, fully, accurately, clearly and conspicuously disclose to end users:\n\n  (i) that they are installing an application,\n\n  (ii) the name of the Application, identifying you as the entity responsible for it, and\n\n  (iii) the principal and significant features and functionality of the Application; and\n\n  (b) then, obtain the end user's affirmative consent to install the Application.\n\n  (a) first, fully, accurately, clearly and conspicuously disclose:\n\n  - 26 -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   4.3 Disclosure and Consent for Setting Changes. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application that makes a  change to any operating system or Application data setting which will impact the user experience of other Applications (e.g., changing the  browser default home page or changing the default application for a file type, such as the default email, browser or media player application),  unless prior to making such change you:\n\n\n\n   Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no disclosure and consent need be made for changes to operating system or Application data settings that  have only a minor impact on user experience, such as adding a small number of bookmarks to the browser menu or adding an item to a start menu,  and (ii) the disclosure and consent requirements of this Section 4.3 will not apply to those setting changes that may be made prior to sale to the  end user.     4.4 Method of Disclosure and Consent. In order to satisfy the requirements above, the disclosure of the items specified above (a) must be  provided in both (1) the End User License Agreement (EULA) or privacy policy (to the extent required by law or otherwise by industry custom)  and (2) separately from the EULA and/or privacy policy (e.g. in installation screens or message boxes, as the case may be), and (b) must be  designed so that it will be read by, adequately inform and evidence the consent of a typical Internet user. See Attachment 1 for sample disclosure  and consent implementations that would satisfy certain of the requirements above.     4.5 EULA and Privacy Policy. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application unless it conforms, and is distributed  pursuant to a EULA that conforms, with all applicable laws and regulations. In addition, you and your Application must comply with the  agreements and representations you make with your end users in your EULA and privacy policy. Your privacy policy must be accessible from  your Application in an easily found location. If your Application collects or transmits any other information related to the user's use of his or her  computer, but not required to be disclosed and consented to pursuant to Section 4.2, then the collection and use of such other information must  be disclosed in your privacy policy.     Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (i) the type of information collected (described with specificity in the case of personally identifiable information),\n\n  (ii) the method of collection (e.g. by registration, etc.), and\n\n  (iii) the location of (i.e., a link to) the privacy policy that governs the collection, use and disclosure of the  information; and\n\n  (b) then, obtain the end user's affirmative consent to such collection and/or transmission.\n\n  (a) first, fully, accurately, clearly and conspicuously disclose the change in a manner that will explain the practical effect of  such change; and\n\n  (b) then, obtain the end user's affirmative consent to make such change.\n\n  - 27 -\n\n\n\n\n\n   5. Transparency. Neither you nor any of your third party distribution or bundling partners may mislead end users or create end user confusion  with regard to the source or owner of an Application or any portion of its purpose, functionality or features. For example, all elements of your  Application that are visible to the end user must clearly identify their source through its branding and attribution, and that identification, whatever  form it takes, must correspond to the identification of your application in the menu that permits end users to remove programs. You must clearly  label advertisements provided by your Application (if any) as such and clearly identify your Application as the source of those advertisements. In  addition, if your Application modifies the operation or display of other applications or Web sites (other than Web sites that you own), then in  each instance you must clearly and conspicuously attribute the source of that modification to your Application (as distinct from the application or  Web site modified) in a manner that will inform a typical Internet user; provided that this requirement will not apply to modifications for which you  obtain disclosure and consent pursuant to Section 4.3. See Attachment 1 for examples of modifications that are clearly and conspicuously  disclosed to end users.     6. Deactivation. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application that impairs an end user's ability to change any preferences or  settings set by the Application in accordance with the way that such preferences or settings ordinarily may be changed by the applicable  Application. Once disabled by an end user, your Application may not be re-enabled without an affirmative action by the end user to explicitly re- enable your application. Accordingly, no use, update, installation or re-enablement of a separate Application, and no code downloaded as a result  of browsing a Web site, may operate to re-enable your Application. Your Application must permit end users to uninstall it (in the customary place  the applicable operating system has designated for adding or removing programs, e.g., Add/Remove Programs control panel in Windows) in a  straightforward manner, without undue effort or skill. In addition, your Application, when running, must provide (in an easily found location) clear  and concise instructions on how it may be uninstalled. Once uninstalled, your Application must not leave behind any functionality or design  elements, and all setting changes made by the application, but not explicitly agreed to by the end user, should be reversed to the extent  practicable.     7. Bundling of Applications. In addition to the requirements set forth in the agreement between you and Google that incorporates these  Guidelines, in order for you to bundle any Application with a Google Application must satisfy each of the following requirements:\n\n\n\n\n\n   Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (a) the end user is made aware of all of the Applications included in the bundle prior to any installation;\n\n  (b) all such Applications included in the bundle or download comply with the provisions of Section 2 through 6 of these  Guidelines;\n\n  (c) if Applications in a bundle in which you are participating are supported in part by revenue generated by advertising  displayed in another independent Application included in that bundle and the continued use of the Application is  conditioned on such other independent Application remaining installed and active on the end user's computer, the end  user must be made aware of that relationship; and\n\n  - 28 -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   8. Information and Assistance. Subject to any confidentiality obligations owed to third parties, you must provide Google with such information as  Google may reasonably request about the distribution of those of your Applications that are bundled with any Google Application. For example,  we may ask you to share with us: (a) the means by and/or the locations from which your Applications are distributed; or (b) the identity of any  applications included in any of your bundling relationships (and the entities responsible for such applications). In addition, you must provide  such assistance as Google may reasonably request to investigate and stop potential violations of these Guidelines that may be connected to your  Application, including by way of using such number of identifiers and other tracking parameters as Google may reasonably request. This would  include providing Google with \"golden masters\" of any bundle or other distribution that includes your Application, or working with Google to  stop any entities that may be financially benefiting from your Application from engaging in any of these proscribed practices. You understand,  however, that Google has no obligation to provide support to end users of your Application. For the avoidance of doubt, these information and  assistance rights do not extend to any of your Applications that are not used to access Google services, bundled with a Google Application, or  bundled with an Application that accesses Google services.     9. Legal. You must maintain ownership and control of your Application at all times to the extent required to practically and legally enforce the  requirements of these guidelines. If you are seeking to permit a third party Application to be bundled with a Google Application, then you must  also obtain Google's written approval of that third party Application (in addition to the approval required for your Application). If Google  approves the third party Application, you are responsible for ensuring that such third party Application also complies with these Guidelines.  Special indemnity and other suspension and/or termination provisions may apply. These are addressed in your agreement with Google.     10. Updates.     10.1 General. As mentioned above, Google may update these Guidelines, including the Attachments, from time to time; provided,  however, that no updates will be effective until Google provides you with thirty (30) days' written notice thereof. Once you receive that notice (the  date on which you receive such notice, the \"Update Notice Date\"), you will be required to bring your Application into compliance within thirty (30)  days     Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (d) either (1) the bundle must provide for a master uninstaller that will enable the end user to uninstall every Application in  the bundle without undue effort or skill, or (2) if no master uninstaller is provided, the de-installation of any Application  may not be dependent or conditioned upon the de-installation of any other Application included in the bundle.\n\n  - 29 -\n\n\n\n\n\n  10.2 Extended Compliance Period. If, solely as a result of an updated requirement, one or more of your Applications no longer complies  with these Guidelines, as updated, and you are incapable of bringing such Application into compliance prior to the scheduled effective date of  such update (the \"Update Effective Date\"), you agree to provide Google with written notice thereof as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any  event no later than the Update Effective Date, identifying the Application and the reasons why it may not be brought into compliance prior to the  Update Effective Date, and providing such other detail as Google may reasonably request with respect thereto (consistent in any event with your  confidentiality obligations). Thereafter, the parties will consult, and you agree to will work, diligently and in good faith to develop and execute a  plan to bring such Application into compliance with these Guidelines, as updated, as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within  ninety (90) days of the Update Notice Date (the \"Maximum Compliance Period\"). You agree that you will provide Google with such information as  Google reasonably requests during this period to keep Google apprised of your progress in bringing your Application into compliance.  Notwithstanding the foregoing (but subject to the next sentence), in no event may a new requirement provided for in any update to these  Guidelines require you to take any action which would violate the terms of any agreement between you and any unaffiliated third party that is in  effect on the date that Google delivers notice of the proposed update. In any event, if you are unable to bring any Application into compliance  during the Maximum Compliance Period, Google may elect, by providing at least thirty (30) days prior written notice, to require you to cease  bundling either the specific non-conforming Application or those versions of the Application which are, or are distributed, in violation of the  Guidelines, as updated; it being understood that, at such time, you will be entitled to procure services from an alternative source for those  Applications (or versions thereof) with respect to which Google has exercised such election.

In the event that, following such investigation, Dova's Third Party Data source does not change the primary specialty designation to Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology or, in the case of those Target Professionals with a primary specialty designation of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology and a secondary specialty designation of Hepatology, changes the primary specialty designation to a specialty other than Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology, then those Target Professionals shall be deemed not to be in the Specialty. For those Target Professionals that were not the subject of an inquiry to or an investigation by Dova's Third Party Data Source, then the specialty designations set out in the original list generated by Dova's Third Party Data Source shall apply for such Calendar Quarter, namely those Target Professionals that have either a\n\nSource: DOVA PHARMACEUTICALS INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2018\n\n\n\n\n\nprimary or a secondary specialty designation of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology and that do not have either a primary or a secondary specialty designation of Hepatology shall be deemed to be in the Specialty.\n\n6.5.4 The process described in this Section 6.5 shall be repeated for each Calendar Quarter of the Term; provided, however, that, pursuant to the process described above, if Dova's Third Party Data Source has confirmed that a Target Professional's primary specialty designation should be or should remain Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology, it is not necessary for Valeant to seek this confirmation in subsequent Calendar Quarters; provided, further, that, if Dova's Third Party Data Source is subsequently updated (by Dova or any Third Party) to change the specialty designation (primary or secondary) of a Target Professional, pursuant to a request by Dova or a Third Party, then the process described in this Section 6.5 shall be repeated with respect to such Target Professional.\n\nARTICLE 7  AUDIT RIGHTS\n\n7.1 Recordkeeping.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION CONTAINED HEREIN (OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH IN THE SECOND SENTENCE OF THIS SECTION 11.4), IN NO EVENT SHALL DOVA (OR ITS AFFILIATES) OR VALEANT (OR ITS AFFILIATES) BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER OR ANY OF THE OTHER PARTY'S AFFILIATES FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS) SUFFERED OR INCURRED BY SUCH OTHER PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES THAT ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT OR IN CONNECTION WITH A BREACH OR ALLEGED BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, AND REGARDLESS OF ANY NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

(\"Dova\") (DOVA), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring, developing, and commercializing drug candidates for diseases where there is a high unmet need, and Salix Pharmaceuticals (\"Salix\"), one of the largest specialty pharmaceutical companies in the world committed to the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases and its parent company, Bausch Health Companies Inc. (NYSE/TSX: BHC), today announced that they have entered into an exclusive agreement to co-promote Dova's DOPTELET (avatrombopag) in the United States (U.S.). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") approved DOPTELET on May 21, 2018 for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) who are scheduled to undergo a procedure. DOPTELET represents the first thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist approved in the United States for this indication.\n\nThrombocytopenia, a condition in which patients have a low platelet count, is the most common hematological abnormality in patients with CLD that often worsens with the severity of liver disease. It is estimated that approximately 15 percent of the 7.5 million patients with CLD have some form of thrombocytopenia. In a study published in 2010, patients with severe thrombocytopenia (<75,000/\u00b5L) had a 31 percent incidence of procedure-related bleeding. As a result of the associated increased rate of bleeding, there is an increased risk for the CLD patient when undergoing common scheduled medical procedures such as liver biopsy, colonoscopy, endoscopy, and routine dental procedures.\n\nAs part of the co-promotion arrangement, Salix intends to deploy approximately 100 sales specialists who will promote DOPTELET to gastroenterology healthcare professionals. The Salix sales force will begin selling DOPTELET in mid-October 2018. Dova will continue its commercial efforts targeting primarily hepatologists and interventional radiologists and certain other specialties. Pursuant to the agreement, Dova will pay Salix a quarterly fee based on net sales (as defined in the agreement) of DOPTELET prescribed by gastroenterologists in the U.S.\n\n\"We are delighted to be working with Salix, a company considered by many to have the preeminent gastroenterology sales force in the United States,\" said Alex C. Sapir, president and chief executive officer, Dova Pharmaceuticals. \"Given Salix's presence and strong reputation within large gastroenterology group practices coupled with the early interest we are seeing among the gastroenterology community, we are excited to see the impact this partnership will bring to DOPTELET and to patients.\"\n\n\"Salix considers liver disease a strategic therapeutic area of focus, given our history and knowledge with XIFAXAN\u00ae (rifaximin), an innovative medicine indicated for the treatment of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a condition that is often a consequence of chronic liver disease,\" said Mark McKenna, president, Salix Pharmaceuticals. \"Adding DOPTELET to our portfolio will enable our sales force to promote yet another innovative product that addresses a true unmet need in the marketplace.\"\n\nCONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED FOR PORTIONS OF THIS EXHIBIT. THE COPY FILED HEREWITH OMITS THE INFORMATION SUBJECT TO A CONFIDENTIALITY REQUEST. OMISSIONS ARE DESIGNATED [***]. A COMPLETE VERSION OF THIS EXHIBIT HAS BEEN FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.\n\nSource: DOVA PHARMACEUTICALS INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2018\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout DOPTELET  DOPTELET (avatrombopag) is a second generation, once daily, orally administered TPO receptor agonist approved for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with CLD who are scheduled to undergo a procedure. DOPTELET is designed to mimic the effects of TPO, the primary regulator of normal platelet production.\n\nTwo global Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (ADAPT-1 [N=231] and ADAPT-2 [N=204]), conducted in adults with thrombocytopenia (platelet count of less than 50,000/\u00b5L) and CLD, supported the FDA approval. Patients were assigned to either 40 mg or 60 mg of avatrombopag daily for five days based on their Baseline platelet counts (40 to <50,000/\u00b5mL or <40,000/\u00b5mL, respectively). Avatrombopag was shown to be superior to placebo in increasing the proportion of patients not requiring platelet transfusions or rescue procedures for bleeding up to seven days following a scheduled procedure in both trials in both the 40 mg (ADAPT-1, 88% vs. 38%, p <0.0001; ADAPT-2, 88% vs. 33%; p<0.0001), and 60 mg (ADAPT-1, 66% vs. 23%, p <0.0001; ADAPT-2, 69% vs. 35%; p=0.0006) treatment groups. Avatrombopag was also superior to placebo at the two secondary efficacy endpoints in each trial. In the avatrombopag treatment groups, there was an increased proportion of patients achieving the target platelet count of \u226550,000/\u00b5mL on procedure day, and a greater magnitude of the change in mean platelet count from baseline to procedure day; all treatment differences between the avatrombopag and placebo treatment groups for each secondary endpoint were highly statistically significant with p values <0.0001. The most common adverse reactions with avatrombopag included pyrexia, abdominal pain, nausea, headache, fatigue and edema peripheral. Portal vein thromboses have been reported in patients with CLD and in patients receiving TPO receptor agonists. One treatment-emergent event of portal vein thrombosis was reported in the ADAPT trials in an avatrombopag-treated patient.\n\nINDICATION\n\nDOPTELET (avatrombopag) is indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo a procedure.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\nDOPTELET is a thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist and TPO receptor agonists have been associated with thrombotic and thromboembolic complications in patients with chronic liver disease. Portal vein thrombosis has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease treated with TPO receptor agonists. In the ADAPT-1 and ADAPT-2 clinical trials, there was one treatment- emergent event of portal vein thrombosis in a patient (n=1/430) with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia treated with DOPTELET.\n\nConsider the potential increased thrombotic risk when administering DOPTELET to patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism, including genetic prothrombotic conditions (Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin 20210A, Antithrombin deficiency or Protein C or S deficiency).\n\nDOPTELET should not be administered to patients with chronic liver disease in an attempt to normalize platelet counts.\n\nCONTRAINDICATIONS: None\n\nCONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED FOR PORTIONS OF THIS EXHIBIT.

It has been proven to reduce the risk of overt HE recurrence and HE-related hospitalizations in adults.\n\n*There is an increased systemic exposure in patients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised when administering XIFAXAN to these patients.\n\nINDICATION  XIFAXAN (rifaximin) 550 mg tablets are indicated for the reduction in risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) recurrence in adults and for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) in adults.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\u2022XIFAXAN is not for everyone. Do not take XIFAXAN if you have a known hypersensitivity to rifaximin, any of the rifamycin antimicrobial agents, or any of the components in XIFAXAN.\n\n\u2022If you take antibiotics, like XIFAXAN, there is a chance you could experience diarrhea caused by an overgrowth of bacteria (C. difficile). This can cause symptoms ranging in severity from mild diarrhea to life-threatening colitis. Contact your healthcare provider if your diarrhea does not improve or worsens.\n\n\u2022Talk to your healthcare provider before taking XIFAXAN if you have severe hepatic (liver) impairment, as this may cause increased effects of the medicine.\n\n\u2022Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking drugs called P-glycoprotein and/or OATPs inhibitors (such as cyclosporine) because using these drugs with XIFAXAN may lead to an increase in the amount of XIFAXAN absorbed by your body.\n\n\u2022In clinical studies, the most common side effects of XIFAXAN were: HE: Peripheral edema (swelling, usually in the ankles or lower limbs), nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), dizziness, fatigue (feeling tired), and ascites (a buildup of fluid in the abdomen)  IBS-D: Nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) and an increase in liver enzymes\n\n\u2022XIFAXAN may affect warfarin activity when taken together. Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking warfarin because the dose of warfarin may need to be adjusted to maintain proper blood-thinning effect.\n\n\u2022If you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or nursing, talk to your healthcare provider before taking XIFAXAN because XIFAXAN may cause harm to an unborn baby or nursing infant. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800- FDA-1088.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED FOR PORTIONS OF THIS EXHIBIT.

It is the only extended-release opioid that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for epidural use. A single  injection of DepoDur into the lumbar epidural space may provide pain relief for up to 48 hours following major surgery without the restrictions and  potential complications associated with an indwelling epidural catheter.\n\n\"The product characteristics of DepoDur fit exceptionally well with EKR's acquisition model,\" said Howard Weisman, EKR's Chairman & CEO.  \"DepoDur is patent protected, addresses an important medical need in our market space, and has growth prospects that can be fully exploited through the application of EKR's expertise and strengths in the acute care market.\"\n\nMr. Weisman further noted, \"EKR is commencing a number of pre-launch activities, including interacting with opinion leaders, and we expect to  fully deploy our sales force in support of DepoDur early next year.\" He concluded, \"We are very optimistic about EKR's growth prospects in 2008  as we foresee a ramp up in sales for both DepoDur and Gelclair\u00ae and anticipate favorable market synergies between these products.\" Gelclair,  which is marketed to acute care facilities and cancer centers, is indicated for the management of pain associated with oral lesions of various  etiologies, including chemotherapy and radiation induced oral mucositis/stomatitis.\n\nTong Zhang, Ph.D., Director of Business Development for EKR, added, \"Acquiring the rights to DepoDur exemplifies EKR's strategy of focusing  on building a portfolio of premier products in the acute care space.\"  He further noted, \"Our strict acquisition criteria center on high-margin,  innovative products that offer value to healthcare providers and their patients, thus, representing excellent opportunities for EKR to realize strong  returns on investment.\"      -73-\n\n\n\n  SCHEDULE VI\n\n  PRESS RELEASE\n\n\u00ae\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Pacira Pharmaceuticals is delighted to have EKR Therapeutics as our marketing and commercialization partner for DepoDur in the Americas,\"  commented Fred Middleton, Pacira's Chairman of the Board. \"This product was clinically developed as a proprietary treatment by Pacira R&D and  it received FDA approval in 2004 for long-acting post surgical pain management, for which it is known to be effective.\"\n\nMr. Middleton further noted, \"EKR Therapeutics has demonstrated in the past that they possess the strengths to successfully bringing a focused  marketing and clinician targeting approach to DepoDur to help it reach its full commercial potential. We look forward to working with EKR, as our  partner on the expanded commercial marketing of DepoDur.\"\n\nDetailed terms of the transaction were not disclosed. However, EKR did note that in addition to royalty payments on net sales, it has agreed to an  upfront payment amounting to somewhat more than [**] times DepoDur's 2006 U.S. sales. EKR has also agreed to certain milestone payments with the sum of upfront and milestone payments potentially worth up to $20 million.\n\nAbout EKR Therapeutics   EKR Therapeutics is a privately held specialty pharmaceutical company that has brought together a highly seasoned team of industry professionals The Company focuses on the acquisition, development and commercialization of proprietary products for the acute care segment of  the healthcare market, including oncology supportive care therapeutics.

Holders whose First Tranche Series E Debt Securities and Second Tranche Series E Debt Securities are remarketed pursuant to this Remarketing Agreement will not otherwise be responsible for the payment of any Remarketing Fee in connection therewith.   5\n\n\n\n\n\n(j) If fewer than all of the Remarketed Securities are remarketed in accordance with the terms hereof, the Remarketing shall be deemed to have failed as to all Remarketed Securities.\n\n(k) If at any time during the term of this Remarketing Agreement, any Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) or event that with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would become such an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture, then the obligations and duties of the Remarketing Agents under this Remarketing Agreement shall be suspended until such default or event has been cured.

In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party or any other indemnified party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof   26\n\n\n\n\n\nother than reasonable costs of investigation, unless (i) the indemnifying party and such indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the contrary, (ii) the indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party or (iii) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and such indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying party be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same allegations or circumstances.\n\n(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, other than due to the express provisions thereof, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other from the Remarketing of the Remarketed Securities to which any such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents of the applicable Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total Remarketing Fee received by the Remarketing Agents, as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Final Prospectus.   27\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Remarketing Agents on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Remarketing Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Remarketing Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Remarketing Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities remarketed by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Remarketing Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Remarketing Agents in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective obligations with respect to such Remarketed Securities and not joint.\n\n(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Remarketing Agent within the meaning of the Act. The obligations of the Remarketing Agents under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Remarketing Agent may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company (including any person who, with his consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.\n\n7. Resignation and Removal of the Remarketing Agents. A Remarketing Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder, and the Company may remove any or all of the Remarketing Agents, by giving five (5) Business Days' prior written notice to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent and, in the case of a removal, to the Remarketing Agents; provided that no such resignation nor any removal of all the Remarketing Agents shall become effective until the Company shall have appointed at least one nationally recognized broker-dealer as successor to the Remarketing Agents, and such successor Remarketing Agent shall have entered into a   28\n\n\n\n\n\nletter substantially in the form of Annex III hereof with the Company and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent in which it shall have agreed to conduct the Remarketing in accordance with the Remarketing Procedures. The provisions of this Section 7 shall survive the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agents pursuant to this Remarketing Agreement.\n\n8. New Remarketing Agents. The Company may appoint any institution or institutions as new Remarketing Agent(s) hereunder (each a \"New Remarketing Agent\") in respect of the Remarketing in which event, upon the confirmation by such institution through a letter to the Company and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent confirming acceptance of such nomination by the New Remarketing Agent substantially in the form of Annex III hereof, such New Remarketing Agent shall become a party hereto, unless otherwise provided for herein, with all the authority, rights, powers, duties and obligations as if originally named as Remarketing Agent hereunder. The Company will notify the Remarketing Agent(s) appointed in respect of the Remarketing of the Remarketed Securities and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent of a change in the identity of other Remarketing Agents appointed or who have resigned in respect of the Remarketing of the Remarketed Securities generally as soon as reasonably practicable.\n\n9. Offering Restrictions. Each Remarketing Agent acknowledges, represents and agrees and each additional Remarketing Agent appointed pursuant to Section 8 of this Remarketing Agreement will be required to acknowledge, represent and agree that it has not remarketed or delivered and it will not remarket or deliver, any of the Remarketed Securities, in or from any jurisdiction except under circumstances that are reasonably designed to result in compliance with the applicable securities laws and regulations thereof. In particular, each Remarketing Agent acknowledges, represents and agrees and each additional Remarketing Agent appointed pursuant to Section 8 of this Remarketing Agreement will be required to acknowledge, represent and agree as set forth in Annex V to this Remarketing Agreement.\n\n10. Dealing in the Remarketed Securities. Each Remarketing Agent, when acting hereunder, or when acting in its individual or any other capacity, may, to the extent permitted by law, buy, sell, hold or deal in any of the Remarketed Securities. The Remarketing Agents may exercise any vote or join in any action which any beneficial owner of Remarketed Securities may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Indenture with like effect as if they did not act in any capacity hereunder. The Remarketing Agents, in their individual capacities, either as principal or agent, may also engage in or have an interest in any financial or other transaction with the Company as freely as if they did not act in any capacity hereunder.\n\n11. Termination of Remarketing Agreement. This Remarketing Agreement shall terminate (i) in the event of a Remarketing that is not a Successful Remarketing or (ii) as to any Remarketing Agent who resigns or is removed, on the effective date of the resignation or removal of such Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 7. In addition, the   29\n\n\n\n\n\nobligations of the Remarketing Agents may be terminated by them by notice given to the Company prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time on the Remarketing Settlement Date if, prior to that time, any of the applicable conditions precedent to the obligations of the Remarketing Agents described in Section 5 hereof shall have failed to occur.\n\n12. Survival. Notwithstanding any such termination set forth in Section 11 hereof, the obligations set forth in Section 4 hereof shall survive and remain in full force and effect until all amounts payable under said Section 4 shall have been paid in full. In addition, the former Remarketing Agents shall be entitled to the rights and benefits under Section 6 of this Remarketing Agreement notwithstanding the replacement or resignation of the Remarketing Agents. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Remarketing Agents, as set forth in this Remarketing Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Remarketing Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Remarketing Agent or any controlling person of any Remarketing Agent, the Company or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.\n\n13.

The masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders, and the word \"person\" shall include a corporation, firm, partnership, or other form of association.\n\nSTRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT \"EDGE-FTE\"  Page 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  30. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; INCONSISTENCIES   A. This Agreement shall incorporate the typed or written provisions of EDGE' Purchase Orders issued pursuant to this Agreement and shall constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and shall not be modified or rescinded except by a writing signed by Subcontractor and EDGE. All references in these terms and conditions to this Agreement or to Work, services, material, equipment, products, software, or information furnished under, in performance of, pursuant to, or in contemplation of this Agreement shall also apply to any Purchase Orders or Amendments issued pursuant to this Agreement. All provisions on Subcontractor's forms shall be deemed deleted. Additional or different terms inserted in this Agreement by Subcontractor, or deletions thereto, whether by alterations, addenda, or otherwise, shall be of no force and effect, unless expressly consented to by EDGE in writing. The provisions of this Agreement supersede all contemporaneous oral agreements and all prior oral and written quotations, communications, agreements, and understandings of the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.   B. The documents referenced in this Agreement are complementary, and what is called for by any one shall be as binding as if called for by all. The intention of the Agreements, Exhibits, and Purchase Order (collectively \"Contract Documents\") is to include all labor, materials, supervision, equipment, transportation and expense necessary for the proper execution of the Work; performance by Subcontractor shall be required to the extent consistent with the Contract Documents to produce the intended results. If a conflict or inconsistency exists between the provisions of this Agreement, the pre-printed terms and conditions on either side of the Purchase Order, any other document, the order of precedence to resolve the conflict or inconsistency is as follows: (a) the Agreement; (b) Exhibits to the Agreement; (c) Purchase Orders; and (d) drawings and specifications. In the event of an irreconcilable conflict, discrepancy, error, or omission, the provision imposing the greater duty on Subcontractor shall apply. Materials or work described in words that have a well-known technical or trade meaning shall be held to refer to such recognized standards.   31. SEVERABILITY   If any provision of this Agreement is illegal or unenforceable, its invalidity shall not affect the other provision of this Agreement that can be given effect without the invalid provision. If any provision of this Agreement does not comply with any law, ordinance or regulation, such provision to the extent possible shall be interpreted in such a manner to comply with such law, ordinance or regulation, or if such interpretation is not possible, it shall be deemed to satisfy the minimum requirements thereof. All provisions required by law shall be deemed incorporated herein by reference.\n\nSTRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT \"EDGE-FTE\"  Page 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  32. AMENDMENT   This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written instrument executed by both EDGE and Subcontractor.   33. RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT   EDGE may, upon reasonable request, require Subcontractor to replace any personnel, including a project manager, deployed by Subcontractor under the terms of this Agreement. Subcontractor will replace any personnel promptly after request from EDGE with an employee of Subcontractor reasonably acceptable to EDGE.   34. NON-SOLICITATION   Subcontractor, during the term of this Agreement and for a period of one year thereafter, shall not, directly or indirectly, for itself or on behalf of or in conjunction with any other person, partnership, corporation, business or organization, solicit, hire, contract with or engage the employment of an employee of EDGE with whom Subcontractor or its personnel have contact as a result of Subcontractor's performance of this Agreement, unless Subcontractor (i) obtains the written consent of EDGE, as applicable, and (ii) pays EDGE as applicable a fee to be mutually agreed upon. In the event Subcontractor directly employs or contracts with an employee of EDGE without the consent of EDGE, Subcontractor shall pay as liquidated damages two times the then monthly salary of the employee for a three-month period of time.\n\nSTRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT \"EDGE-FTE\"  Page 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  35.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor shall not be deemed to have assumed, pursuant to this Agreement, any duties with respect to, and shall not be responsible for, the management of the Trust's assets or the rendering of investment advice and supervision with respect thereto or the distribution of shares of any series, nor shall the Sponsor be deemed to have assumed or have any responsibility with respect to functions specifically assumed by any transfer agent, custodian, fund accounting pricing agent or shareholder servicing agent of the Trust.\n\n         2. Allocation of Charges and Expenses. Domini shall pay the entire salaries and wages of all of the Trust's Trustees, officers and agents who devote part or all of their time to the affairs of Domini or its affiliates, and the wages and salaries of such persons shall not be deemed to be expenses incurred by the Trust for purposes of this Section 2.

If Domini serves as the Sponsor for less than the whole of any period specified in this Section 3, the compensation to Domini, as Sponsor, shall be prorated. For purposes of computing the fees payable to the Sponsor hereunder, the value of the Trust's net assets shall be computed in the manner specified in the Trust's then-current prospectus and statement of additional information.\n\n                                       2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         4. Limitation of Liability of the Sponsor. The Sponsor shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any act or omission in the oversight, administration or management of the Trust or the performance of its duties hereunder, except for willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder. As used in this Section 4, the term \"Sponsor\" shall include Domini and/or any of its affiliates and the directors, officers and employees of Domini and/or any of its affiliates.\n\n         5. Activities of the Sponsor. The services of the Sponsor to the Trust are not to be deemed to be exclusive, Domini being free to render oversight, administrative and/or other services to other parties.

This Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, with respect to any series or the Trust, by the Board of Trustees of the Trust, or by the Sponsor, in each case on not less than 60 days' written notice to the other party.\n\n         7. Subcontracting by Domini. Domini may subcontract for the performance of some or all of Domini's obligations hereunder with any one or more persons; provided, however, that Domini shall not enter into any such subcontract unless the Trustees of the Trust shall have found the subcontracting party to be qualified to perform the obligations sought to be subcontracted; and provided, further, that, unless the Trust otherwise expressly agrees in writing, Domini shall be as fully responsible to the Trust for the acts and omissions of any subcontractor as it would be for its own acts or omissions.\n\n         8. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall become or shall be found to be invalid by a court decision, statute, rule or otherwise, the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby.\n\n         9.

IN CONSIDERATION of these premises, the conditions stated herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency and receipt of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows: 1. Confidential Information. Member shall not, during the term of the Franchise Agreement or thereafter, communicate, divulge or use, for any purpose other than the operation of the Franchised Business, any confidential information, knowledge, trade secrets or know-how which may be communicated to Member or which Member may learn by virtue of Member's relationship with Franchisee. All information, knowledge and know-how relating to Franchisor, its business plans, Franchised Businesses, or the System (\"Confidential Information\") is deemed confidential, except for information that Member can demonstrate came to Member's attention by lawful means prior to disclosure to Member; or which, at the time of the disclosure to Member, had become a part of the public domain. 2. Covenants Not to Compete. (a) Member specifically acknowledges that, pursuant to the Franchise Agreement, and by virtue of its position with Franchisee, Member will receive valuable specialized training and Confidential Information, including, without limitation, information regarding the operational, sales, promotional, and marketing methods and techniques of Franchisor and the System. (b) Member covenants and agrees that during the term of the Franchise Agreement, except as otherwise approved in writing by Franchisor, Member shall not, either directly or indirectly, for itself, or through, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any person, persons, partnership, corporation, or entity: (i) Own, manage, engage in, be employed by, advise, make loans to, consult for, rent or lease to, or have any other interest in business that (directly or indirectly) operates, or grants franchises or licenses to operate, a restaurant featuring pizza and related food specialties or that offers products or services substantially similar to those then offered by Pizza Fusions Restaurants (\"Competitive Business\"); C - 1\n\nSource: PF HOSPITALITY GROUP INC., 10-12G, 9/23/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) Divert or attempt to divert any business or customer, or potential business or customer, to any Competitive Business; or (iii) Induce any person to leave his or her employment with Franchisee or Franchisor. (c) Member covenants and agrees that during the Post-Term Period (defined below), except as otherwise approved in writing by Franchisor, Member shall not, either directly or indirectly, own, manage, engage in, be employed by, advise, make loans to, consult for, or have any other interest in any Competitive Business that is, or intends to operate, within a three (3) mile radius of the premises of your Franchised Business or within a three (3) mile radius of any Franchised Business then-operating or under construction to operate under the System. (d) As used in this Agreement, the term \"Post-Term Period\" shall mean a continuous uninterrupted period of two (2) years from the date of: (a) a transfer permitted under Section 14 of the Franchise Agreement; (b) expiration or termination of the Franchise Agreement (regardless of the cause for termination); (c) termination of Member's employment with Franchisee; and/or (d) a final order of a duly authorized arbitrator, panel of arbitrators, or a court of competent jurisdiction (after all appeals have been taken) with respect to any of the foregoing or with respect to the enforcement of this Agreement; either directly or indirectly (through, on behalf of, or in conjunction with any persons, partnership, corporation or entity). 3. Injunctive Relief. Member acknowledges that any failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement will cause Franchisor irreparable injury, and Member agrees to pay all court costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by Franchisor in obtaining specific performance of, or an injunction against violation of, the requirements of this Agreement. 4. Severability. All agreements and covenants contained herein are severable. If any of them, or any part or parts of them, shall be held invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction for any reason, then the Member agrees that the court shall have the authority to reform and modify that provision in order that the restriction shall be the maximum necessary to protect Franchisor's and/or Franchisee's legitimate business needs as permitted by applicable law and public policy. In so doing, the Member agrees that the court shall impose the provision with retroactive effect as close as possible to the provision held to be invalid. 5. Delay. No delay or failure by the Franchisor or Franchisee to exercise any right under this Agreement, and no partial or single exercise of that right, shall constitute a waiver of that or any other right provided herein, and no waiver of any violation of any terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of any succeeding violation of the same or any other provision of this Agreement. 6. Third-Party Beneficiary. Member hereby acknowledges and agrees that Franchisor is an intended third-party beneficiary of this Agreement with the right to enforce it, independently or jointly with Franchisee.

Each of Nuance (on behalf of itself and each other member of the Nuance Group) and SpinCo (on behalf of itself and each other member of the SpinCo Group) understands and agrees that, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, no Party is representing or warranting in any way, including any 11\n\nSource: CERENCE INC., 8-K, 10/2/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nimplied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, registerability, allowability, enforceability or non-infringement, as to any Intellectual Property Rights licensed hereunder, as to the sufficiency of the Intellectual Property Rights licensed hereunder for the conduct and operations of the SpinCo Business or the Nuance Business, as applicable, as to the value or freedom from any Security Interests of, or any other matter concerning, any Intellectual Property Rights licensed hereunder, or as to the absence of any defenses or rights of setoff or freedom from counterclaim with respect to any claim or other Intellectual Property Rights of any such Party, or as to the legal sufficiency of any assignment, document or instrument delivered hereunder to convey title to any Intellectual Property Rights or thing of value upon the execution, delivery and filing hereof or thereof. Except as may expressly be set forth herein, any such Intellectual Property Rights are being licensed on an \"as is,\" \"where is\" basis and the respective licensees shall bear the economic and legal risks related to the use of the Nuance IP in the SpinCo Business or the SpinCo IP in the Nuance Business, as applicable.\n\nARTICLE VIII TRANSFERABILITY AND ASSIGNMENT\n\nSection 8.01.

Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement, including the licenses granted pursuant to this Agreement, shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Party to this Agreement (or any of its successors or permitted assigns) (a) shall enter into a consolidation or merger transaction in which such Party is not the surviving entity and the surviving entity acquires or assumes all or substantially all of such Party's assets, (b) shall transfer all or substantially all of such Party's assets to any Person or (c) shall assign this Agreement to such Party's Affiliates, then, in each such case, the assigning Party (or its successors or permitted assigns, as applicable) shall ensure that the assignee or successor-in-interest expressly assumes in writing all of the obligations of the assigning Party under this Agreement, and the assigning Party shall not be required to seek consent, but shall provide written notice and evidence of such assignment, assumption or succession to the non-assigning Party. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. No assignment permitted by this Section 8.01 shall release the assigning Party from liability for the full performance of its obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the licenses granted in this Agreement extend to products, services or other activities of the assignee existing on or before the date of the transaction described in clauses (a) or (b) of the preceding sentence, except to the extent that they were licensed under the terms of this Agreement prior to such transaction.\n\nSection 8.02.

The retention of any license grants are subject to the Divested Entity's and, in the event it is acquired by a Third Party, such Third Party's execution and delivery to the non-transferring Party, within 90 days of the effective date of such divestment, of a duly authorized, written undertaking, agreeing to be bound by the applicable terms of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) in no event will the licenses retained by a Divested Entity extend to products, services or other activities of a Third Party acquirer existing on or before the date of the divestment, except to the extent that they were licensed under the terms of this Agreement prior to such divestment, and (ii) in the event that a Divested Entity owns any Intellectual Property Rights licensed to the other Party under this Agreement, such Intellectual Property Rights may be transferred or assignment with such Divested Entity subject to the terms and conditions this Agreement.\n\nARTICLE IX TERMINATION\n\nSection 9.01. Termination by Both Parties. Subject to Section 9.02, this Agreement may not be terminated except by an agreement in writing signed by a duly authorized officer of each of the Parties.\n\nSection 9.02. Termination prior to the Distribution. This Agreement may be terminated by Nuance at any time, in its sole discretion, prior to the Distribution; provided, however, that this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the termination of the Separation Agreement in accordance with its terms.\n\nSection 9.03. Effect of Termination; Survival. In the event of any termination of this Agreement prior to the Distribution, neither Party (nor any member of their Group or any of their respective directors or officers) shall have any Liability or further obligation to the other Party or any member of its Group under this Agreement. Except with respect to termination of the Agreement under Section 9.02, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, ARTICLE I, ARTICLE VI, ARTICLE VII, this Section 9.03 and ARTICLE XI shall survive any termination of this Agreement.\n\nARTICLE X FURTHER ASSURANCES\n\nSection 10.01.

Each of the Parties hereby agrees that it shall not assert, and shall hereby waive, any claim or right or defense that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of such courts, that the venue is improper, that the forum is inconvenient or any similar objection, claim or argument.

Upon any such determination, any such provision, to the extent determined to be invalid, void or unenforceable, shall be deemed replaced by a provision that such court determines is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid, void or unenforceable provision.\n\nSection 11.12. Expenses. Except as set forth on Schedule XXIV to the Separation Agreement, as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or the Separation Agreement, (i) all third-party fees, costs and expenses incurred by either the Nuance Group or the SpinCo Group in connection with effecting the Spin-Off prior to or on the Distribution Date, whether payable prior to, on or following the Distribution Date (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any financing fees or interest payable in respect of any indebtedness incurred by SpinCo in connection with the Spin-Off), will be borne and paid by Nuance and (ii) all third-party fees, costs and expenses incurred by either the Nuance Group or the SpinCo Group in connection with effecting the Spin-Off following the Distribution Date, whether payable prior to, on or following the Distribution Date, will be borne and paid by the Party incurring such fee, cost or expense.

Waiver by any Party of any default by the other Party of any provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver by the waiving Party of any subsequent or other default.\n\nSection 11.16. Amendments. No provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed waived, amended, supplemented or modified by any Party, unless such waiver, amendment, 18\n\nSource: CERENCE INC., 8-K, 10/2/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nsupplement or modification is in writing and signed by the authorized representative of each Party.\n\nSection 11.17.

Buyer will defend and indemnify Seller against: (1) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged breach of this Agreement by Buyer; (2) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged negligence or other legally culpable misconduct of Buyer in the purchase, storage, repackaging, resale or delivery of any product purchased from Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of other obligation of Buyer under this Agreement; (3) any third-party claim for actual or alleged infringement of a product sold by Seller under this Agreement or its design, manufacture, storage, sale or delivery by Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of any other obligation of Seller under this Agreement to the extent based on intellectual property that that Buyer has represented and warranted to Seller that Buyer owns and that Buyer has licensed to Seller and that Seller has used in compliance with the license term in supplying the product; (4) the threat or imposition of any fine, penalty or other sanction by governmental authority on Seller to the extent caused by any actual or alleged violation by Buyer of Applicable Law; or (5) any other matter that Buyer has agreed to defend and indemnify Seller against under a Purchase Schedule. d. As a condition of receiving defense and indemnification under this Section for an Indemnified Claim, the Indemnified Party must: (1) notify and tender the defense of an Indemnified Claim to the Indemnifying Party promptly after the Indemnified Party learns of the Indemnified Claim; and\n\nSource: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1, 11/15/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n(2) provide information and cooperation reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. An Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party of any reasonable, actual, substantiated out-of-pocket expense incurred in providing the requested information or cooperation. e. If the Indemnifying Party accepts the tender of defense of an Indemnified Claim, with or without reservation, the Indemnifying Party will: (1) promptly notify the Indemnified Party of the acceptance of the tender of defense of the Indemnified Claim. (2) control the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim, including, without limitation, the selection of licensed, qualified and reputable attorneys and expert witnesses and all decisions over settlement and litigation strategy. The Indemnifying Party must act in good faith in exercising control over the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. (3) Provide information reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party regarding the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim f. An Indemnifying Party, acting in good faith, may settle an Indemnified Claim for which it is responsible under this Agreement involving infringement on the intellectual property of a third-party by: (1) obtaining a license from the third-party allowing the required use of its intellectual property; (2) modifying a product, equipment or process in a manner which avoids infringing on the intellectual property of the third-party; or (3) voluntarily withdrawing the infringing product from the market and either refunding the amount paid by the Indemnified Party for the infringing product or replacing the infringing product with a non-infringing product. g. The Parties may disagree on whether a claim is an Indemnified Claim under this Agreement, which Party should be considered the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party for an Indemnified Claim or whether each Party is partially liable for an Indemnified Claim and how liability for such an Indemnified Claim should be allocated between them. In these and other circumstances in which an actual or potential conflict of interest exists or arises between the Parties with regards to an alleged or agreed upon Indemnified Claim that would preclude their joint representation by a single defense counsel, the Parties will endeavor in good faith to attempt to resolve the conflict.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer is entitled to rely on (i) the descriptive information in transaction documents issued by either Party in the ordinary course of business during the Term identifying the ordered Products (e.g., the type and quantity of ordered products and scheduled date and location for delivery) and (ii) FDA guaranty letters and other similar written assurances in Seller's standard forms certifying that a product complies with Applicable Laws issued by Seller to Buyers and other U.S. customers in the ordinance course of business during the Term. b. Exclusion of Indirect Damages; Waiver of Claim for Insured Damage or Loss. A Party that breaches this Agreement will only be liable to the other Party for direct damages arising from the breach. Each Party waives any right to recover consequential, incidental, indirect, exemplary, punitive or any other types of indirect damages from the other Party for a breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, this Subsection will not limit the liability of a Party for any amount or type of damages for: (1) the defense and indemnification of an Indemnified Claim on which the Party is the Indemnifying Party; (2) infringement by the Party on the intellectual property of the other Party; (3) the unauthorized disclosure or use by the Party of the Confidential Information of the other Party; (4) payment or reimbursement of any amount expressly required to be paid or reimbursed by the Party under a provision of this Agreement; or (5) the intentional misconduct of the Party in violation of Applicable Laws. c. Force Majeure. A Party will not be considered in breach of this Agreement or liable to the other Party for any interruption or delay in performance under this Agreement to the extent caused by an event outside of the ability of the performing Party to foresee and avoid with the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts (such an event is referred to at times as an event of \"Force Majeure\"). Examples of events of Force Majeure include, without limitation: natural disasters; war; acts of terrorism; government action; accident; strikes, slowdowns and other labor disputes; shortages in or inability to obtain material, equipment, transportation or labor; any breach, negligence, criminal misconduct or other act or omission of any third-party; fire or other insured or uninsured casualty.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party will only be excused for an interruption or delay in performance under this Subsection for an event of Force Majeure only if the Party (1) promptly notifies the other Party of the event of Force Majeure and provides information reasonably requested by the other Party regarding the event of Force Majeure, the efforts undertaken by the\n\nSource: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1, 11/15/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nParty to foresee and avoid interruption or delay in its performance before the occurrence of the event, to mitigate interruption or delay in performance during the event, and to recover from and restore performance following the event; and (2) the Party exercises commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate, recover from and restore performance following the event of Force Majeure. During, and while recovering from and restoring performance following, an event of Force Majeure, Seller will act in good faith in allocating its available manufacturing capacity to supply products to Buyer under this Agreement and any products to other customers of Seller. If an event of Force Majeure interrupts or delays Seller from supplying a product to Buyer under this Agreement in the quantities and timetable required by Buyer, Buyer may cancel any unfilled orders for the product with Seller and procure the required quantities of the product from one or more other sources until Seller has recovered from and restored its ability to perform following the event of Force Majeure. If the interruption or delay in the supply of a product to Buyer under this Agreement caused by an event of Force Majeure has exceeded, or is reasonably likely to exceed, thirty (30) days, Buyer may enter into longer term supply agreements or make other arrangements to procure the required quantities of the product from one or more other sources for a duration and on terms acceptable to Buyer in its good faith discretion. In such a circumstance, Buyer will not have to resume purchasing the product from Seller under this Agreement until Seller has recovered from and restored its ability to perform following the event of Force Majeure and the longer term agreements or other arrangements have expired or Buyer is able to end them without liability. This Subsection will not excuse nor extend a deadline by which a Party must pay an amount owed under this Agreement or Applicable Law or by which a Party must exercise any right or remedy under this Agreement or Applicable Law.\n\n10.

If a Disclosing Party neglects to label or deliver timely written notice to the Receiving Party identifying the disclosed information as confidential in nature, the disclosed information will only be treated as Confidential Information under this Agreement if the Disclosing Party is able to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the Receiving Party knew that the disclosed information was a trade secret or other non-public, proprietary information of the Disclosing Party at the time of disclosure.\n\nSource: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1, 11/15/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nThe criteria in Clause (2) and Clause (3) will not apply to Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party observed or heard by a Receiving Party in a plant, warehouse, facility or system of the Disclosing Party.

A Receiving Party and its direct and indirect subsidiaries may continue to use the Know- How of the Disclosing Party and its direct and indirect subsidiaries in the possession of the Receiving Party and its direct and indirect subsidiaries as of the Effective Date for the Authorized Purpose and in connection with the operation of the business of the Receiving Party and its direct and indirect subsidiaries.

A Receiving Party will promptly notify the Disclosing Party if the Receiving Party learns of any unauthorized disclosure or use of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party by any\n\nSource: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1, 11/15/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nperson.

An \"Affiliate\" of a Party means a legal entity that owns and controls, or is owned and controlled by, or is under common ownership and control with, a Party (other than the other Party or any of its direct and indirect subsidiaries), with ownership and control of a legal entity being determined by the ownership of the majority voting interest in the legal entity. A \"Representative\" means the Affiliates of a Party and the directors, officers, managers, employees, accountants, attorneys, auditors and other agents and consultants of a Party and its Affiliates.

If legally permissible and reasonably possible, a Receiving Party will notify the Disclosing Party prior to disclosing its Confidential Information pursuant to this Section and cooperate in good faith with any lawful efforts by the Disclosing Party to avoid or limit the disclosure of its Confidential Information. A Receiving Party will not be obligated to incur any liability, expense or risk in extending such cooperation to a Disclosing Party. Based on legal advice of its attorney, a Receiving Party may disclose the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party by any deadline established under an Applicable Law, accounting standard and securities exchange requirement. (3) A Receiving Party may disclose and use the Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party to enforce or interpret this Agreement or any other agreement with the Disclosing Party in any arbitration, court or other legal proceeding. A Receiving Party may disclose and use this Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party to defend the Receiving Party or its Affiliates or their respective Representatives in any arbitration, court or other legal proceeding.

(4) A Receiving Party and its Representatives may disclose and use the Confidential Information for any other purpose consented to by a Disclosing Party in a written notice signed by an officer of the Disclosing Party delivered to the Receiving Party. g. In disclosing its Confidential Information to a Receiving Party, a Disclosing Party represents, warrants and covenants to the Receiving Party that: (1) The Disclosing Party owns and has the right to disclose and authorize the use of Confidential Information as provided in this Agreement.\n\nSource: REYNOLDS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INC., S-1, 11/15/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n(2) The Receiving Party and its Representatives may use the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for the Authorized Purpose and other limited purposes provided in this Agreement. (3) The Disclosing Party will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Receiving Party and its Representatives against any claim of a third-party that the disclosure and use of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party as provided in this Agreement infringes on a patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property of the third-party registered in or otherwise recognized and enforceable under Applicable Laws.\n\nExcept for the limited representations and warranties in this Section, a Disclosing Party disclaims all other representations and warranties of any kind related to its Confidential Information, whether express, implied or arising by operation of law, including the disclaimer, without limitation, of any representation and warranties concerning merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, truth, accuracy or completeness. h. The rights and obligations of the Parties under this Section with regards to disclosed Confidential Information will continue: (1) Until the earlier of (i) sixty (60) months from the date of disclosure to a Receiving Party or (ii) the date such information ceases to be considered Confidential Information under this Agreement, for Confidential Information that is not a trade secret of a Disclosing Party under Applicable Law; and (2) Until Confidential Information that is a trade secret of a Disclosing Party under Applicable Law ceases to be a trade secret of the Disclosing Party under Applicable Law. i.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Receiving Party and its Representatives may retain copies of Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party which (x) the Receiving Party and its Representatives are required to retain to comply with Applicable Laws, accounting standards and security exchange requirements (but only for the duration and in the manner so required for this limited purpose); or (y) have been archived in electronic form by the Receiving Party and its Representatives and which would be unduly burdensome for the Receiving Party and its Representatives to have to search for and delete the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party. j. Except for the limited right to disclose and use Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party for the Authorized Purpose and other purposes provided in the this Section and except for any license of intellectual property granted by a Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party in a Purchase Schedule, this Agreement does not grant a Receiving Party or its Representatives any right, title, interest or ownership in the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party nor in any patent, trademark, copyright or other intellectual property of the Disclosing Party.

Late Fees and Collection Costs. If Buyer fails to pay Seller an amount owed under this Agreement by the invoice due date, then Buyer will owe Seller: (i) the delinquent amount; and (ii) a late payment fee equal to two percent (2%) of the delinquent amount for each full or partial calendar month past the invoice due date that the delinquent amount remains unpaid.

A Party may approve or reject a request for an amendment in its sole and absolute discretion. c. Waiver.

No right or obligation under this Agreement will be considered to have been waived by a Party unless such waiver is in writing and is signed by an officer of the waiving Party and delivered to the other Party.

SECTION 1. SERVICES AS UNDERWRITER Section 1.1 Integrity will act as principal underwriter for the distribution of the Shares covered by the registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information then in effect of the Fund (the \"Registration Statement\") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"1933 Act\"), and the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\"). Section 1.2 Integrity agrees to use its best efforts to solicit orders for the sale of the Shares at the public offering price, as determined in accordance with the Registration Statement, and will undertake such advertising and promotion as it believes is reasonable in connection with such solicitation. Integrity shall order Shares from the Fund only to the extent that it shall have received purchase orders therefore. Section 1.3 All activities by Integrity as underwriter of the Shares shall comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including, without limitation, all rules and regulations made or adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") or by any securities association registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Fund's Registration Statement.

Section 1.6 Integrity shall be deemed to be an independent contractor and, except as specifically provided or authorized herein, shall have no authority to act for or represent the Fund. Integrity will act only on its own behalf as principal should it choose to enter into selling agreements with selected dealers or others. Integrity may allow commissions or concessions to dealers in such amounts as Integrity shall determine from time to time, as set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement. Except as may otherwise be determined by Integrity and the Fund from time to time, such commissions or concessions shall be uniform to all dealers. Shares sold to dealers shall be for resale by such dealers only at the public offering price(s) set forth in the Fund's then current Registration Statement.

Distribution expenses, however, shall not include any expenditures in connection with services which Integrity, any of its affiliates, or any other person has agreed to bear without reimbursement. Section 1.9 Integrity shall prepare and deliver reports to the Treasurer of the Fund and to the Investment Adviser on a regular, at least quarterly, basis, showing the distribution expenses incurred pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan and the purposes therefore, as well as any supplemental reports as the Trustees, from time to time, may reasonably request. SECTION 2. DUTIES OF THE FUND Section 2.1 The Fund agrees at its own expense to execute any and all documents, to furnish any and all information, and to take any other actions that may be reasonably necessary in connection with the qualification of the Shares for sale in those states that Integrity may designate. Section 2.2 The Fund shall furnish from time to time, for use in connection with the sale of the Shares, such information reports with respect to the Fund and its Shares as Integrity may reasonably request, all of which shall be signed by one or more of the Fund's duly authorized officers; and the Fund warrants that the statements contained in any such reports, when so signed by one or more of the Fund's officers, shall be true and correct. The Fund shall also furnish Integrity upon request with: (a) annual audits of the Fund's books and accounts made by independent public accountants regularly retained by the Fund, (b) semi-annual unaudited financial statements pertaining to the Fund, (c) quarterly earnings statements prepared by the Fund, (d) a monthly itemized list of the securities in the portfolio of the Fund, (e) monthly balance sheets as soon as practicable after the end of each month, and (f) from time to time such additional information regarding the Fund's financial condition as Integrity may reasonably request. Section 2.3 The Fund shall pay to Integrity, as set forth in the Registration Statement, any distribution and service fee authorized by the Plan. SECTION 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES Section 3.1 The Fund represents to Integrity that all registration statements, prospectuses, and statements of additional information filed by the Fund with the SEC under the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act with respect to the Shares of the Fund have been carefully prepared in conformity with the requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. As used in this Agreement, the terms \"registration statement,\" \"prospectus,\" and \"statement of additional information\" shall mean any registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information filed by the Fund with the SEC and any amendments and supplements thereto which at any time shall have been filed with the SEC. The Fund represents and warrants to Integrity that any registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information, when such registration statement becomes effective, will include all statements required to be contained therein in conformity with the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC; that all statements of fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information will be true and correct when such registration statement becomes effective; and that neither any registration statement nor any prospectus or statement of additional information when such registration statement becomes effective will include an untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading to a purchaser of Shares. Integrity may, but shall not be obligated to, propose from time to time such amendment or amendments to any registration statement and such supplement or supplements to any prospectus or statement of additional information as, in the light of future developments, may, in the opinion of Integrity's counsel, be necessary or advisable. If the Fund shall not propose such amendment or amendments and/or supplement or supplements within fifteen days after receipt by the Fund of a written request from Integrity to do so, Integrity may, at its option, terminate this Agreement. The Fund shall not file any amendment to any registration statement or supplement to any prospectus or statement of additional information without giving Integrity reasonable notice thereof in advance; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall in any way limit the Fund's right to file at any time such amendments to any registration statement and/or supplements to any prospectus or statement of additional information, of whatever character, as the Fund may deem advisable, such right being in all respects absolute and unconditional. 3\n\nSource: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nSECTION 4.

The Fund agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Integrity, its several officers and governors, and any person who controls Integrity within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, free and harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, and expenses (including the cost of investigating or defending such claims, demands, or liabilities and any counsel fees incurred in connection therewith) which Integrity, its officers and governors, or any such controlling person may incur under the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, or common law or otherwise, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, any prospectus, or any statement of additional information, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated in any registration statement, any prospectus, or any statement of additional information, or necessary to make the statements in any of them not misleading; provided, however, that the Fund's agreement to indemnify Integrity, its officers or governors, and any such controlling person shall not be deemed to cover any claims, demands, liabilities, or expenses arising out of or based upon any statements or representations made by Integrity or its representatives or agents other than such statements and representations as are contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information and in such financial and other statements as are furnished to Integrity pursuant to paragraph 2.2 hereof; and further provided that the Fund's agreement to indemnify Integrity and the Fund's representations and warranties hereinbefore set forth in paragraph 3 shall not be deemed to cover any liability to the Fund or its shareholders to which Integrity would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of Integrity's reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement. The Fund's agreement to indemnify Integrity, its officers and governors, and any such controlling person, as aforesaid, is expressly conditioned upon the Fund's being notified of any action brought against Integrity, its officers or governors, or any such controlling person, such notification to be given by letter or by telegram addressed to the Fund at its principal office in Minot, North Dakota, and sent to the Fund by the person against whom such action is brought, within ten days after the summons or other first legal process shall have been served. The failure so to notify the Fund of any such action shall not relieve the Fund from any liability that the Fund may have to the person against whom such action is brought by reason of any such untrue statement or omission or alleged omission otherwise than on account of the Fund's indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph 4.1. The Fund's indemnification agreement contained in this paragraph 4.1 and the Fund's representations and warranties in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of Integrity, its officers and governors, or any controlling person, and shall survive the delivery of any Shares. This agreement of indemnity will inure exclusively to Integrity's benefit, to the benefit of its several officers and governors, and their respective estates, and to the benefit of the controlling persons and their successors. The Fund agrees to notify Integrity promptly of the commencement of any litigation or proceedings against the Fund or any of its officers or trustees in connection with the issuance and sale of any Shares. 4\n\nSource: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 4.2 Integrity agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold the Fund, its several officers and trustees, and any person who controls the Fund within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, free and harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, and expenses (including the costs of investigating or defending such claims, demands, or liabilities and any counsel fees incurred in connection therewith) that the Fund, its officers or trustees, or any such controlling person may incur under the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, or common law or otherwise, but only to the extent that such liability or expense incurred by the Fund, its officers or trustees, or such controlling person resulting from such claims or demands shall arise out of or be based upon (a) any unauthorized sales literature, advertisements, information, statements, or representations or (b) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in information furnished in writing by Integrity to the Fund and used in the answers to any of the items of the registration statement or in the corresponding statements made in the prospectus or statement of additional information, or shall arise out of or be based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in connection with such information furnished in writing by Integrity to the Fund and required to be stated in such answers or necessary to make such information not misleading. Integrity's agreement to indemnify the Fund, its officers and trustees, and any such controlling person, as aforesaid, is expressly conditioned upon Integrity's being notified of any action brought against the Fund, its officers or trustees, or any such controlling person, such notification to be given by letter or telegram addressed to Integrity at its principal office in Minot, North Dakota, and sent to Integrity by the person against whom such action is brought, within ten days after the summons or other first legal process shall have been served. The failure so to notify Integrity of any such action shall not relieve Integrity from any liability that Integrity may have to the Fund, its officers or trustees, or to such controlling person by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission otherwise than on account of Integrity's indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph 4.2. Integrity agrees to notify the Fund promptly of the commencement of any litigation or proceedings against Integrity or any of its officers or governors in connection with the issuance and sale of any Shares. 5\n\nSource: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 4.3 In case any action shall be brought against any indemnified party under paragraph 4.1 or 4.2, and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall wish to do so, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party. If the indemnifying party opts to assume the defense of such action, the indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than (a) reasonable costs of investigation or the furnishing of documents or witnesses and (b) all reasonable fees and expenses of separate counsel to such indemnified party if (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the indemnified party shall have concluded reasonably that representation of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them in the conduct of the defense of such action. SECTION 5. EFFECTIVENESS OF REGISTRATION Section 5.1 None of the Shares shall be offered by either Integrity or the Fund under any of the provisions of this Agreement and no orders for the purchase or sale of the Shares hereunder shall be accepted by the Fund if and so long as the effectiveness of the registration statement then in effect or any necessary amendments thereto shall be suspended under any of the provisions of the 1933 Act or if and so long as a current prospectus as required by Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933 Act is not on file with the SEC; provided, however, that nothing contained in this paragraph 5 shall in any way restrict or have an application to or bearing upon the Fund's obligation to repurchase Shares from any shareholder in accordance with the provisions of the Fund's prospectus, statement of additional information, or declaration of trust.

The execution and delivery of this Agreement have been authorized by the Trustees and signed by an authorized officer of the Fund, acting as such, and neither such authorization by such Trustees nor such execution and delivery by such officer shall be deemed to have been made by any of them individually or to impose any liability on any of them personally, but shall bind only the property of the Fund. 7\n\nSource: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 8.3 This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Kansas.

Agreements with  identified parties are allowed exceptions and no Agreements are allowed with unidentified parties.     3.8 Commencing on October 1, 2008, and continuing for so long as IntriCon continues to make minimum payments as defined in 4.3,  Dynamic Hearing agrees that it will not license any Dynamic Hearing Technology for Hearing Aids, subject to Clause 3.5.     3.9 If any Identified Party, (with the exception of Sound Design) purchases DSP product sold or made by IntriCon with Dynamic  Hearing's Hearing Aid Designer\u2122 software and requests assistance to achieve HIMPP compliance for products using such DSP chips, IntriCon  will use its best efforts to comply with the request for HIMPP compliance.     3.10 Where IntriCon supplies Products to a third party, IntriCon will, at its cost:\n\n\n\n   7\n\n       (a)    obtain and maintain all governmental and regulatory approvals necessary for it to exercise, and comply with all laws and  regulations applicable to the exercise of, its license rights under this Agreement; and\n\n       (b)    comply, and ensure that all Products comply, at all times with any technical standards as may reasonably be required  by law, and any licensing requirements, standards, or protocols established by the Hearing Instrument Manufacturers'  Software Association (HIMSA) and the Hearing Instrument Manufacturers'  Patent Partnership (HIMPP), it being  acknowledged that Dynamic Hearing makes no representation or warranty that the exercise of the rights granted under  this Agreement will not infringe any rights held by HIMSA, HIMPP or any other third party.\n\n\n\n\n\n      3.11 Where Dynamic Hearing supplies Dynamic Hearing Technology directly to a customer on DSP chips supplied by IntriCon, then,  IntriCon will use its best efforts to comply with the request for HIMPP compliance or notify the third party customer of the customers obligations,  as per 3.10 (a) and (b).     3.12 Dynamic Hearing may continue indefinitely selling products and services to new customers using the ON Semiconductor DSP  hybrid chip. For the absence of doubt, the Exclusivity grant of 3.2 does not restrict Dynamic Hearing from licensing Dynamic Hearing Technology  and DSP Software on any ON Semiconductor platform, purchased by a third party or by Dynamic Hearing, from IntriCon. With the exception of the  Identified Parties, Dynamic Hearing agrees that it will not sell the Dynamic Hearing DSP Software for Hearing Aids configured to run on any  hardware other than that provided by ON Semiconductor, except in circumstances as described in this Agreement. Dynamic Hearing may continue  to sell products and services to non-Hearing Aid Customers using the ON Semiconductor DSP hybrid chips including the Bela Signa.     3.13 Dynamic Hearing and IntriCon shall undertake a mutual roadmap review and agree whether or not the current ON Semiconductor  chips will meet market requirements. If the Parties agree that the ON Semiconductor chips will not meet market requirements, IntriCon shall have six  (6) months to correct the material deficiency. Material deficiency means that ON Semiconductors must have a chip that is within 10% of the best in  class performance on each one of these characteristics: physical size, power supply current, computational capability and cost. If IntriCon is  unable or unwilling to remedy such deficiency, IntriCon will lose its exclusivity under this license.     3.14 IntriCon agrees that nothing in this Agreement precludes Dynamic Hearing from licensing Dynamic Hearing Technology, including  the ADRO\u2122 Algorithm to manufacturers, including Siemens AG, Sonova Holdings AG, GN Resound Group, William Demant Holding A/S, Widex  A/S, Starkey Laboratories Inc, and Cochlear Ltd.     3.15 Nothing herein shall preclude Dynamic Hearing from making and selling its own Hearing Aids. Nothing in this agreement prevents  Dynamic Hearing from selling Hearing Aids manufactured by third parties in Dynamic Hearing's own clinics.     3.16 No other exception to IntriCon's exclusive license being granted herein shall exist unless such exception is specifically identified by  a supplemental agreement between IntriCon and Dynamic Hearing.\n\n   4.1 IntriCon's payments to Dynamic Hearing will comprise two payment components. A first payment component (minimum payment) will  be a technology access fee for access to Dynamic Hearing Technology on a non-exclusive basis. A second payment component hereinafter  (Second Component) will be for exclusive rights to Dynamic Hearing Technology as such exclusive rights are defined herein. The second  component may comprise a combination of a royalty payment and fees for services.     8\n\n  4.0    Payments\n\n\n\n\n\n      4.2 IntriCon will pay to Dynamic Hearing a fixed technology access fee of US$300,000 annually (hereinafter \"Access Fee\"), the payment  of the technology access fee to be paid on a quarterly basis at the beginning of each calendar quarter. Payment of the technology Access Fee will  maintain IntriCon's non-exclusive rights to Dynamic Hearing Technology.     4.3 To maintain exclusive rights to Dynamic Hearing Technology for Hearing Aids IntriCon will make minimum annual payments to  Dynamic Hearing as set out in the Minimum Payment Schedule. The Minimum Payment consists of the Access Fee of US$300,000 per annum and  the Second Component that increases from year to year.     Minimum Payment Schedule (All amounts are in US Dollars):\n\n   The Minimum Payments will be paid quarterly in advance in equal installments at the beginning of each royalty quarter, as defined in 4.7.  The first quarterly Minimum Payment (for the quarter beginning 1st October, 2008) shall be made at the date of signing of this Agreement and the  second quarterly minimum payment shall be made at January 1, 2009 with all further quarterly Minimum Payments following the schedule as  defined in 4.7.     4.4 Intricon is entitled to credit for any amounts payable to Dynamic Hearing arising from per unit royalties and fees for services up to the  value of the corresponding quarterly Second Component. In quarters where the per unit royalties and fees for services are less than the  corresponding quarterly Second Component, IntriCon may carry forward the remaining credit to be offset against future quarters per unit royalties  and fees for services.     Any amounts due from per unit royalties and fees for services that exceed the value of the corresponding quarterly payment of the  Second Component, net of any carried forward credit, will be paid within 30 days of the end of that royalty quarter.     4.5 Once IntriCon has paid the minimum payments in 4.3, no further minimum payments, both Access Fee and Second Component, are  required for access to Dynamic Hearing Technology or to maintain exclusivity over the term of this Agreement. IntriCon will continue to have the  obligation to pay royalty payments under 4.9 and fees for services under 4.8.     4.6 In the event IntriCon has not yet paid the minimum payments and should IntriCon choose not to continue access to Dynamic Hearing  Technology on an exclusive basis as referred to in 4.3, the following amounts will be payable:\n\n   9\n\n            PAYMENT  YEAR\n\nMINIMUM PAYMENT    ACCESS FEE    SECOND COMPONENT\n\nYear 1    $400,000    $300,000    $100,000    Year 2    $700,000    $300,000    $400,000    Year 3    $1,100,000    $300,000    $800,000    Year 4    $1,600,000    $300,000    $1,300,000    Year 5    $2,100,000    $300,000    $1,800,000\n\n       (1)    the technology Access Fee payable quarterly in advance in equal installments at the beginning of each royalty quarter  and;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   4.7 Payment year 1 of this agreement shall start at the commencement date and the first royalty quarter will be completed at the end of the  calendar quarter. Subsequent royalty quarters will correspond with the calendar quarters ending on the last days of March, June, September and  December respectively.     4.8 Dynamic Hearing shall provide engineering and other services (hereinafter \"Fees For Services\")  to IntriCon on a timetable to be  agreed upon in writing forming part of this agreement as an exhibit. Dynamic Hearing will invoice IntriCon on a quarterly basis 30 days from the  end of the quarter for engineering and services that exceed 260 hours in a single month at the rate of $150 per hour. Payments for such services  shall be due and payable within 30 days of the end of that royalty quarter. There will be no charge by Dynamic Hearing to IntriCon for the first 260  hours of engineering and services provided each month, however, any unused hours will not be carried forward as credit to subsequent months or  be entitled to be offset against any future monthly amounts payable for engineering and services. IntriCon is entitled to utilize such engineering  services for the HH, ALD or PADA markets.     Other service support (e.g. marketing or audiology) may be contracted at the same rates. If Dynamic Hearing staff are required by IntriCon  to travel to meetings, all airfares, ground transportation, hotel bills and other out of pocket expenses will be paid by IntriCon.     4.9 Royalty Payments will be made only on the Base Product Unit, or on the Base Product portion of an Enhanced Product for any Base  Product included in an Enhanced Product. The initial base rate of royalty shall include the use of the DSP Framework. In no case shall IntriCon pay  Royalty Payments on any product or portion of any product other than for revenue received for Base Product Unit or for the Base Product portion  of an Enhanced Product, and in the case a Base Product portion of an Enhanced Product such Base Product portion shall not be given a value that  is influenced by its inclusion in the Enhanced Product. Royalty Payment for HH, ALD and PADA units that incorporate Dynamic Hearing  Technology shall be paid according to the table set forth below:\n\n   The maximum royalty rate identified in the table herein includes an initial base rate of 3% for each Ezairo DSP platform and 1% for each  Single Chip Hearing Aid (SCHA) sold. A 2% royalty rate per Base Product Unit shall be added to the initial base rate for each DSP feature/module  that is based on Dynamic Hearing Technology and that is added to a Base Product Unit. However, such additional Royalty Payments when added  to the initial base rate shall not exceed in total the stated maximum rates specified in the table herein.     10\n\n       (2)    any monthly fees for services and royalties are payable in accordance with clause 4.8 and royalty payments under 4.4  and 4.9.\n\n                Cumulative annual HH & ALD  Volume that use the Framework\n\nEzairo Maximum Royalty Rate    SCHA Maximum Royalty Rate\n\nLess Than 20,000 Units    10%    8%    20,000-50,000 units    9%    7%    50,000-100,000 units    8%    6%    100,000-200,000 units    7%    5%    200,000-500,000 units    6%    4%    500,000 to 1,000,000 units    5%    3%    Over 1,000,000    5%    1.5%\n\n\n\n\n\n      4.10 All amounts payable by IntriCon under this Agreement must be paid free and clear of and without any deduction or withholding for  or on account of any present or future withholding tax, including any interest or penalties in relation to such tax (Withholding Taxes). If IntriCon is  required to make any deduction or withholding for any Withholding Tax, then IntriCon must pay to Dynamic Hearing such additional amount to  ensure that Dynamic Hearing receives such amount that would have been received by it as if no such withholding or deduction had been required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   5.1 Within thirty (30) days of the end of each payment quarter IntriCon must provide to Dynamic Hearing a statement of the actual  number and value of Base Product Units Sold along with the number and value of DSP features/models sold with those Base Product Units by it  or any Related Body Corporate. The statement must also include calculations of the per unit royalty in accordance with clause 4.9. Any royalty  due for payment by IntriCon to Dynamic Hearing is payable at the same time the statement is provided.     5.2 A Royalty Payment will be due only once in respect of each Base Product Unit Sold, and the Royalty Payment will be due on the first  Sale of the Base Product Unit by IntriCon or a Related Body Corporate.     5.3 Where, in any payment quarter, a Base Product Unit is, in good faith, returned to IntriCon, IntriCon is not required to pay any  Royalty Payment on the Sale of that Base Product Unit. If IntriCon has paid a Royalty Payment on that Base Product Unit in a previous payment  quarter, IntriCon may reduce the Royalty Payment due for the payment quarter in which the Base Product Unit is returned by the amount of any  such Royalty paid.\n\n\n\n       1)    IntriCon must bear all stamp duty that may be levied on this Agreement. IntriCon must bear any other taxes, levies,  imposts, charges, rates and duties that may be levied or imposed by a governmental authority on any person (including  fines, penalties and interest) in connection with this Agreement (other than income tax payable to the Commonwealth of  Australia by Dynamic Hearing).\n\n       2)    Each party must bear its own costs arising out of the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement.\n\n       3)    All amounts payable to Dynamic Hearing under this Agreement must be made without set-off, counterclaim or  deduction.\n\n  5.0    Reports\n\n  6.0    Records and Audit\n\n\n   6.1 IntriCon must keep accurate and complete records of orders received, Base Product Units / DSP Features/Modules Sold and  returned and all other records reasonably necessary to substantiate all Royalty Payments to be made to Dynamic Hearing under this Agreement.     11\n\n\n      6.2 IntriCon must make all such records available for inspection, copying and audit by an independent auditor appointed by Dynamic  Hearing (and to which IntriCon has no reasonable objection) during ordinary business hours at any time during the Term and for a period of one  year following the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, provided that:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   6.3 If in any audit, the auditor finds an underpayment or an overpayment of fees due under this Agreement, the party who has received  the overpayment or has underpaid will within 7 days repay the excess or pay the shortfall (as the case may be) to the other party.\n\n   7.1 Each party must:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   7.2 This Agreement is confidential and each party must not disclose any part of this Agreement to any person without the prior written  consent of the other party.     12\n\n       (a)    such inspection, copying or audit must only be made after at least one Business Day's written notice;\n\n       (b)    such audit must not unreasonably interfere with the day to day operations of IntriCon; and\n\n       (c)    such audit must be at Dynamic Hearing's expense unless the auditor finds an underpayment royalty due under this  Agreement in excess of 5% in which case IntriCon must reimburse Dynamic Hearing's reasonable cost of such audit;  and\n\n       (d)    Audits will be limited to one audit in any calendar year.\n\n  7.0    Confidentiality\n\n       (a)    not disclose any Confidential Information to any person, except in confidence as permitted by this Agreement;\n\n       (b)    not use any Confidential Information except as reasonably necessary for the purpose of putting this Agreement into  effect (Permitted Purpose);\n\n       (c)    restrict access to Confidential Information to those of its employees and officers for whom such access is not  reasonably necessary for the Permitted Purpose;\n\n       (d)    ensure that its employees and officers comply with this Agreement;

Merchant acknowledges, and the Approval Order (as and when applicable) shall provide, that the Additional Agent Merchandise shall be consigned to Merchant as a true consignment under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in the State of Delaware (the \"UCC\").

Subject to the Wind-Down Budget and payment of Expenses, Agent shall use the E-Commerce Platform in connection with the GOB Sale to fulfill customer orders made during the GOB Sale Term and otherwise promote the GOB Sale (in Agent's capacity as Agent hereunder), provided that Agent shall have the option, in its sole discretion, to terminate the use of the E-Commerce Platform at any time after four weeks of use. During the use of the E-Commerce Platform, and consistent with the Wind-Down Budget (i) Merchant shall continue to provide for the operation and maintenance of the E-Commerce Platform, including information technology and E-Commerce Platform updates, and provide Agent with all assistance with respect to the functionality of the E-Commerce Platform, fulfillment of orders, and promotion of the GOB Sale and (ii) Agent shall pay as an Expense those amounts reflected in Section 4.1(p) through and including the date that is seven (7) days after Agent provides Merchant with notice of Agent's intention to discontinue using the E-Commerce Platform as a sales platform to fulfill customer orders (the \"LDOB Date\"); provided, however, that, if Agent continues the Sale at the Stores after the LDOB Date, Merchant shall, as a Central Service and at no cost or expense to Agent (other than as provided in the Wind-Down Budget), maintain the E-Commerce Platform with limited functionality for the limited purposes\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\nCase 18-10248- MFW Doc 632-1 Filed 04/18/18 Page 24 of 60\n\nof advertising and promoting the Sale at the Stores, periodically updating such advertising and promotions, and maintaining and updating the Store locator function at no cost or expense to Agent.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merchant's employees shall at all times remain employees of Merchant. Agent's selection and scheduling of Merchant's employees shall at all times comply with all applicable laws and regulations. Merchant and Agent agree that, except to the extent that wages and benefits of Retained Employees constitute Expenses hereunder, nothing contained in this Agreement and none of Agent's actions taken in respect of the Sale shall be deemed to constitute an assumption by Agent of any of Merchant's obligations relating to any of Merchant's employees including, without limitation, Excluded Payroll Benefits, Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification Act (\"WARN Act\") claims and other termination type claims and obligations, or any other amounts required to be paid by statute or law; nor shall Agent become liable under any employment agreement, collective bargaining agreement, or be deemed a joint or successor employer with respect to such employees. For the avoidance of doubt, Merchant shall be responsible for providing any required notice under the WARN Act with respect to its employees and otherwise comply with the WARN Act with respect to any \"plant closing\" or \"mass layoff' (as defined in the WARN Act) or group termination or similar event affecting the employees, whether before or after the date of this Agreement.

Merchant shall not transfer any employee in anticipation of the Sale nor any Retained Employee during the Sale Term, in each case without Agent's prior consent. To the extent reasonably requested by Agent, and at Agent's expense, Merchant shall use commercially reasonable efforts to hire additional temporary employees to facilitate the GOB Sale, which employees shall constitute Retained Employees for purposes of this Agreement.\n\n9.2 Termination of Employees. Agent may in its discretion stop using any Retained Employee at any time during the Sale, subject to the conditions provided for herein. In the event that Agent desires to cease using any Retained Employee, Agent shall notify Merchant at least seven (7) days prior thereto; provided, however, that, in the event that Agent determines to cease using an employee \"for cause\" (such as dishonesty, fraud or breach of employee duties), the seven (7) day notice period shall not apply; provided, further, however, that Agent shall immediately notify Merchant of the basis for such \"cause.\" From and after the date of this Agreement and until the Sale Termination Date, Merchant shall not transfer or dismiss employees of the Stores or Distribution Centers except \"for cause\" without Agent's prior consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Agent shall not have the right to terminate the actual employment of any employee, but rather may only cease using such employee in the Sale and paying any Expenses with respect to such employee (and all decisions relating to the termination or non-termination of such employees shall at all times rest solely with Merchant).\n\n9.3 Payroll Matters. During the Sale Term, Merchant shall process the payroll for all Retained Employees and any former employees and temporary labor engaged for the Sale. Each Wednesday (or such other date as may be reasonably requested by Merchant to permit the funding of the payroll accounts before such payroll is due and payable) during the Sale Term, Agent shall transfer to Merchant's payroll accounts an amount equal to the base payroll for Retained Employees plus related payroll taxes, workers' compensation and benefits for such week, to the extent such amount constitutes Expenses hereunder.\n\n9.4 Employee Retention Bonuses.

Merchant shall not make any change in the amount of any deductibles or self-insurance amounts on or after the date of this Agreement without Purchaser's prior written consent.\n\n12.2 Merchant's Casualty Insurance.

From and after the date of this Agreement, all such policies will also name Purchaser as an additional named insured or loss payee, as applicable (as its interest may appear). In the event of a loss to the Assets on or after the date of this Agreement, all proceeds of such insurance shall constitute Proceeds hereunder. Merchant shall deliver to Purchaser certificates evidencing such insurance, setting forth the duration thereof and naming Purchaser as an additional insured or loss payee, as applicable, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser.

No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of the Agent, any right, remedy, power, privilege or adjustment hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power, privilege, or adjustment hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power, privilege, or adjustment.\n\n15.13 Entire Agreement.

The Sale shall be conducted so that the Stores in which sales are to occur will remain open no longer than during the normal hours of operation provided for in the respective leases for the Stores.\n\nB. The Sale shall be conducted in accordance with applicable state and local \"Blue Laws\", where applicable, so that no Sale shall be conducted on Sunday unless the Merchant had been operating such Store on a Sunday.\n\nC. On \"shopping center\" property, Agent shall not distribute handbills, leaflets or other written materials to customers outside of any Stores' premises, unless permitted by the lease or, if distribution is customary in the \"shopping center\" in which such Store is located; provided that Agent may solicit customers in the Stores themselves. On \"shopping center\" property, Agent shall not use any flashing lights or amplified sound to advertise the Sale or solicit customers, except as permitted under the applicable lease or agreed to by the landlord.\n\nD. At the conclusion of the Sale or the Designation Rights Period, as applicable, Agent shall vacate the Stores in broom clean condition; provided that Agent may abandon any FF&E not sold in the Sale at the Stores, the Distribution Centers, the Headquarters, or Merchant's other corporate offices at the conclusion of the Sale or the Designation Rights Period, as applicable, without cost or liability of any kind to Agent. Any abandoned FF&E left in a Store or Distribution Center, the Headquarters, or Merchant's other corporate offices after a lease is rejected shall be deemed abandoned to the landlord having a right to dispose of the same as the landlord chooses without any liability whatsoever on the part of the landlord to any party and without waiver of any damage claims against the Merchant. For the avoidance of doubt, as of the Sale Termination Date or termination of the Designation Rights Period, as applicable, Agent may abandon, in place and without further responsibility or liability of any kind, any FF&E located at a Store or, Distribution Center, the Headquarters, or Merchant's other corporate offices.\n\nE.

Agent shall be permitted to utilize display, hanging signs, and interior banners in connection with the Sale; provided, however, that such display, hanging signs, and interior banners shall be professionally produced and hung in a professional manner. The Merchant and Agent shall not use neon or day-glo on its display, hanging signs, or interior banners. Furthermore, with respect to enclosed mall locations, no exterior signs or signs in common areas of a mall shall be used unless otherwise expressly permitted in these Sale Guidelines. In addition, the Merchant and Agent shall be permitted to utilize exterior banners at (i) non- enclosed mall Stores and (ii) enclosed mall Stores to the extent the entrance to the applicable Store does not require entry into the enclosed mall common area; provided, however, that such banners shall be located or hung so as to make clear that the Sale is being conducted only at the affected Store, shall not be wider than the storefront of the Store, and shall not be larger than 4 feet x 40 feet. In addition, the Merchant and Agent shall be permitted to utilize sign walkers in a safe and professional manner and in accordance with the terms of the Approval Order. Nothing contained in these Sale Guidelines shall be construed to create or impose upon Agent any additional restrictions not contained in the applicable lease agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nCase 18-10248- MFW Doc 632-1 Filed 04/18/18 Page 59 of 60\n\nF.

Except with respect to the hanging of exterior banners, Agent shall not make any alterations to the storefront or exterior walls of any Stores.\n\nH. Agent shall not make any alterations to interior or exterior Store lighting. No property of the landlord of a Store shall be removed or sold during the Sale. The hanging of exterior banners or in- Store signage and banners shall not constitute an alteration to a Store.\n\nI. Agent shall keep Store premises and surrounding areas clear and orderly consistent with present practices.\n\nJ. Subject to the provisions of the Agreement, Agent shall have the right to sell all Owned FF&E at the Closing Stores and the Distribution Centers, the Headquarters and (subject to any side letter between JV Agent and Purchaser, which shall not in any way affect Merchant's rights under the Agreement) and Purchaser shall have the right to sell all Owned FF&E at the Designation Rights Stores and the Nebraska Distribution Center. JV Agent may advertise the sale of the Owned FF&E in a manner consistent with these guidelines at the Closing Stores and the Indiana Distribution Center and Purchaser may advertise the sale of the Owned FF&E in a manner consistent with these guidelines at the Designation Rights Stores and the Nebraska Distribution Center. The purchasers of any Owned FF&E sold during the sale shall be permitted to remove the Owned FF&E either through the back shipping areas at any time, or through other areas after applicable business hours. For the avoidance of doubt, as of the Sale Termination Date or the termination of the Designation Rights Period, as applicable, Agent may abandon, in place and without further responsibility, any FF&E at the Stores, the Distribution Centers, the Headquarters, and Merchant's other corporate offices.\n\nK. Agent shall be entitled to include Additional Agent Merchandise in the Sale in accordance with the terms of the Approval Order and the Agreement.\n\nL. At the conclusion of the Sale at each Store, pending assumption or rejection of applicable leases, the landlords of the Stores shall have reasonable access to the Stores' premises as set forth in the applicable leases. The Merchant, Agent and their agents and representatives shall continue to have access to the Stores as provided for in the Agreement.\n\nM. Post-petition rents shall be paid by the Merchant as required by the Bankruptcy Code until the rejection or assumption and assignment of each lease. Agent shall have no responsibility to the landlords therefor.\n\nN. The rights of landlords against Merchant for any damages to a Store shall be reserved in accordance with the provisions of the applicable lease.\n\nO. If and to the extent that the landlord of any Store affected hereby contends that Agent or Merchant is in breach of or default under these Sale Guidelines, such landlord shall email or deliver written notice by overnight delivery on the Merchant, JV Agent and Purchaser as follows:\n\nIf to Agent:\n\nGreat American Group, LLC Attn: Scott Carpenter (scarpenter@greatamerican.com)\n\n\n\n\n\nCase 18-10248- MFW Doc 632-1 Filed 04/18/18 Page 60 of 60 Alan Forman (aforman@brileyfin.com)\n\nand\n\nTiger Capital Group, LLC Attn: Christopher Huber (chuber@tigergroup.com) Mark Naughton (mnaughton@tigergroup.com)\n\nand\n\nWilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB Attn: [_]\n\nWith copies (which shall not constitute notice) to:\n\nLowenstein Sandler LLP Counsel to Great American Group LLC Attn: Kenneth A.

In the event that Wildform receives such Nonconformance Notice from On2, Wildform shall make commercially reasonable efforts to modify such Deliverable and re-deliver it to On2 after any such modification is completed. Each Deliverable shall be deemed to have been accepted by On2 when either (i) On2 notifies Wildform in writing of its acceptance of such Deliverables or (ii) On2 does not deliver a Nonconformance Notice to Wildform within the Acceptance Period. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, On2 shall not unreasonably withhold acceptance of any Deliverable.\n\n      3.2 Program Errors.

The foregoing notwithstanding, the payment provided for in this Article IV is not intended to constitute consideration for the Purchased Assets and Licensed Assets, payment for the license of which is provided for in the Asset Purchase Agreement.\n\n                                    ARTICLE V\n\n                                 CONFIDENTIALITY\n\n      5.1 Use of Confidential Information.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall be permitted to disclose Confidential Information without any violation of this Agreement if such disclosure is required by law, but in such event the Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party in writing in advance of such disclosure, and provide the Disclosing Party with copies of any related information so that the Disclosing Party may take appropriate action to protect its Confidential Information. The Receiving Party acknowledges that the disclosure of Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party may cause irreparable injury to the Disclosing Party and damages that may be difficult to ascertain. The Disclosing Party shall, therefore, be entitled to injunctive relief upon a disclosure or threatened disclosure of any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in violation of this Agreement, in addition to such other remedies as may be available at law or in equity. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall promptly advise the Disclosing Party in the event that the Receiving Party learns or has reason to believe that any person or entity that has had access to Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party through the Receiving Party has violated or intends to violate the terms of this Agreement.\n\n      5.3 Receiving Party's Duty of Care. Receiving Party shall protect the Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure by exercising the same degree of care that Receiving Party uses with respect to information of its own of a similar nature, but in no event less than reasonable care, until five (5) years from the later of the Effective Date or the date of receipt of such Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, with respect to Receiving Party's employees, Receiving Party shall only disclose Confidential Information to a Receiving Party employee who has a need to know such Confidential Information for purposes of this Agreement or any customer sublicense and is informed of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information. The foregoing notwithstanding, each Party shall be liable for any failure by such Party's employees, agents or representatives to comply with the\n\n\n\n\n\nprovisions of this Section 5 as fully as if such employees, agents or representatives were a party to this Agreement.\n\n                                   ARTICLE VI\n\n                                   WARRANTIES\n\n      6.1 On2 Warranties.

Wildform acknowledges that an             investment in the Payment Shares represents a high degree of risk\n\n            and that there is no assurance that Buyer's business or operations             will be successful. Wildform has considered carefully the risks             attendant to an investment in the Payment Shares and acknowledges             that, as a consequence of such risks, such Wildform could lose its             entire investment in the Payment Shares. Wildform acknowledges that,             at a reasonable time prior to the Effective Date, Buyer furnished to             it the information specified in paragraph (b)2(ii)(A) or (B) of, and             in either event the information specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C)             of, Rule 502 promulgated under Exchange Act.\n\n      (c)   Restricted Securities.

Wildform acknowledges that it may dispose of             the Payment Shares only pursuant to an effective registration             statement under the Act or an exception from registration if             available. Wildform further understands that, except as provided in             the Registration Rights Agreement (as defined below), Buyer has no             obligation to register the sale of the Payment Shares or take any             other action so as to permit sales pursuant to the Act. Wildform             further understands that applicable state securities laws may impose             additional constraints upon the sale of securities\n\n      6.3 No Warranty.
