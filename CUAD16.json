Accounting Provisions. The Joint Venturers shall maintain adequate books      and records to be kept of all the Joint Venture activities and affairs      conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. All direct costs and      expenses, which shall include any insurance costs in connection with the      distribution of the Products or operations of the Joint Venture, or if the      business of the Joint Venture requires additional office facilities than      those now presently maintained by each Joint Venturer, such item shall be\n\n\n\n\n\n     paid by the Joint Venture. The fiscal year of the Joint Venture shall be      the calendar year, and shall use the cash basis of accounting. If requested      by a Joint Venturer, the Joint Venture books and records shall be audited      as of the close of each year by an independent accountant acceptable to      both Joint Venturers. All books and records of every kind and character, of      the Joint Venture, and other information, shall be kept at the principal      office of the Joint Venture, or at such other place or places as may be      agreed upon by the Joint Venturers, and shall be fully available to each      Joint Venturer or his duly authorized representative, all at reasonable      times.

Term of Joint Venture. The Joint Venture shall commence on the 1st of      March, 2003, and shall be effective until February 28, 2004 unless extended      by written agreement of the Joint Venturers not less than thirty (30) days      prior to scheduled termination.\n\n9.   Distributions. During the term of the Joint Venture, no interest shall be      allowed to any Joint Venturer upon the amount of his contribution. No Joint      Venturer shall withdraw, transfer or have paid to him in any manner any      part of his capital contribution or account, or any other funds or property      of the Joint Venture without the consent of both Joint Venturers; provided,      however, there may be distributed to the Joint Venturers, from time to      time, so much of the gross income of the Joint Venture as shall not be      needed to defray the necessary and expected costs and expenses of the Joint      Venture business. Distributions may only be made if after any distribution      is made, the Joint Venture assets are in excess of all liabilities of the      Joint Venture. Each distribution shall be made ratably to the Joint      Venturers according to their prorata interest in the Joint Venture as shown      in Section 6.\n\n10.  Internal Revenue Code Election. The Joint Venturers agree and declare that      this association for the carrying on of a joint venture business operation      does not, and is not intended to create a partnership, for either legal or      United States income tax purposes, each Party recognizing that the other is      willing and able to contribute capital, labor, and services for the      operation of a successful joint venture business. Further, each Party      elects under the authority of Section 761(a) of the Internal Revenue Code      of 1986 (the \"Code\"), as amended and all successor statutes, to be excluded      from the application of all of the provisions of Subchapter K of Chapter 1      of the Subtitle A of the Code, and the Parties agree that the election out      of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code shall, if necessary,      be manifested by their execution and filing of all appropriate      documentation. The Parties also declare that they are not making any      agreement to undertake any business other than that set forth in this      Agreement; and nothing in this Agreement is to be construed as a limitation      of the powers or rights of either Party to carry on his separate business      for his sole benefit; provided, however, the Parties shall cooperate with      each other according to the terms and spirit of this Agreement in the      performance of their joint venture business operation.\n\n11.  Procedure on Termination and Liquidation. On any termination of the Joint      Venture, its debt shall be paid or provided for in a manner satisfactory to      the Joint Venturers. Then, any unexpended portion of Joint Venture funds      shall be distributed to the Joint Venturers in accordance with their      prorata ownership in the Joint Venture and all other assets of the Joint      Venture shall be distributed as undivided interests to the Joint Venturers      ratably according to their prorata interests in the Joint Venture as set      forth in Section 6. If any asset is not capable of being distributed on an      undivided basis, the Parties shall agree on a price for such asset and it      shall be distributed to one Party and a corresponding balance, in cash or      property, shall be made of the Joint Venture assets so that each Party      receives his proportionate share of all the Joint Venture assets.\n\n12.  Sale or Purchase of Interest of Joint Venturer Prohibited. No Joint      Venturer shall be authorized or empowered to mortgage, hypothecate, pledge,      sell, or transfer, an interest in the Joint Venture, nor confer on any      successor or assignee the right to become a Joint Venturer without the      consent of the other Joint Venturer.\n\n13.  Notice. Any notice which a Joint Venturer shall have occasion to give to      the other Joint Venturer shall be deemed sufficient notice for all purposes      as to its contents if given in writing, hand delivered, by fax, or prepaid      mail, to the address of such Joint Venturer as set out below his signature.\n\n14.  Construction. The Joint Venturers declare that in entering into this      Agreement, they have contracted with reference to the laws of the      Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the construction and interpretation of      the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted and      construed under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, except in      such cases and to such extent as the laws of another jurisdiction shall      necessarily control.\n\n15.

For further clarity, nothing in this Section 6.1.1 (BLI Standstill) is intended to prevent a Third Party BLI customer or partner from using, practicing or otherwise exploiting any independently developed improvement, invention, process or workflow even if similar to a Headstart Invention as long as BLI and its Affiliates are in compliance with this Section 6.1.1 (BLI Standstill) [***]. If a Workflow Development Plan is cancelled under the terms of this Agreement, then the Headstart Period with respect to Headstart Inventions under such Workflow Development Plan shall be deemed to have immediately accelerated to conclusion, unless Ginkgo (x) identifies in writing one or more Headstart Inventions under the Workflow Development Plan within [***] ([***]) Business Days of cancellation of the Workflow Development Plan and (y) [***], in which case such Headstart Invention(s) shall be subject to the applicable Headstart Period under this Section 6.1.1 (BLI Standstill); provided that, Ginkgo's right to identify [***] under clauses (x) and (y) shall not exist if the cancellation of a Workflow Development Plan is [***].\n\n6.1.2 [***].

During the Term and for a period of [***] ([***]) months following the Term of this Agreement, other than pursuant to Sections 13.3.2 (Effects of Termination Based Upon Ginkgo's Buy-Down Election) or 13.3.3 (Effects of Termination Based Upon an Uncured Ginkgo Breach, Insolvency or Force Majeure Event), BLI shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, itself or with or through a Third Party, develop, configure, customize, license, sell, provide or otherwise give access to the Beacon Platform or any [***] to, [***] or its Affiliates for any use; provided that this restriction shall terminate as set forth in Section 13.3 (Effects of Expiration or Termination) or if Ginkgo has not satisfied its Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitments (as such may be adjusted under this Agreement) for a full Contract Year, including [***] as permitted under Section 7.2.2(a) (Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitments) or Section 7.2.2(b)(iii) (Development Purchase Commitments); provided that BLI will provide written notice to Ginkgo within [***] ([***]) days of the end of any Contract Year with respect to which BLI believes that Ginkgo has not satisfied its Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a Change in Control of an existing (as of the Effective Date or at any time during the Term) Third Party BLI customer results in such customer being controlled [***] following the date such Third Party became a BLI customer, BLI shall promptly notify Ginkgo in writing of such Change in Control (in no event later than [***] ([***]) days after BLI first learns of such Change in Control, [***] (in which case such notice will be provided by BLI no later than [***] ([***]) days after the earlier of [***] or [***]) and, in such written notice, provide Ginkgo with information regarding [***] and, if BLI does [***], the [***].

In the event BLI notifies Ginkgo as aforesaid and Ginkgo fails to make such election within the [***] ([***]) day period, then, in the case of (A) or (B), BLI will not be deemed to be in breach of this Section 6.2.1 (Restrictions on BLI) solely on account of a Third Party customer [***]. Nothing in this Section 6.2.1 (Restrictions on BLI) will require or oblige BLI [***], then [***]. In the event [***], [***] in a manner that (x) [***], (y) [***] or (z) [***].

As used in this Section 6.2.1 (Restrictions on BLI), \"control\" has the meaning set forth in Section 1.2 (\"Affiliate\" definition). For clarity, [***].\n\n6.2.2 No Further Restrictions by Ginkgo. During the Term, Ginkgo shall not [***] prohibit (i.e. by [***]), as part of any [***] arrangement with a Third Party, a Third Party from purchasing a Beacon Platform or other BLI products or services, or otherwise using or utilizing such Beacon Platforms for [***], including [***]. For clarity, such obligation shall not prohibit or limit Ginkgo from entering into generally exclusive relationships with Third Parties (e.g., [***]). 7. ECONOMICS\n\n7.1 Upfront Payment. No later than [***] ([***]) days following the Effective Date, Ginkgo will pay to BLI a non-refundable upfront amount equal to Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) (the \"Upfront Payment\").

[***].\n\n7.2 Purchase Commitments.\n\n7.2.1 Generally. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, during the Term, the Parties' target is for Ginkgo to make a total of One Hundred Fifty Million Dollars ($150,000,000) in Development Purchases and Production Purchases from BLI (as amended from time to time under this Agreement and as more fully set forth in this Section 7.2 (Purchase Commitments), the \"Full Purchase Target\"), which Full Purchase Target is divided into Contract Year purchase commitment targets with respect to Development Purchase Commitment and Production Purchase Targets, as more fully set forth in Section 7.2.2 (Contract Year Purchase Targets and Commitments).\n\n7.2.2 Contract Year Purchase Targets and Commitments. Subject to the terms of this Agreement (including the remainder of this Section 7.2.2 (Contract Year Purchase Targets and Commitments)), for each Contract Year, Ginkgo shall [***] make Development Purchases and Production Purchases from BLI in the amounts set forth in the Page 36 of 85\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Development Purchase Commitment\" and \"Production Purchase Target\" columns respectively in Table 7.2.2 with respect to such Contract Year:\n\nTable 7.2.2\n\nDevelopment Purchase Commitment\n\nProduction Purchase Target\n\nTotal Targeted Purchase\n\nMinimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment Contract Year 1 $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] Contract Year 2 $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] Contract Year 3 $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] Contract Year 4 $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] Contract Year 5 $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] Contract Year 6 $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] $ [***] Contract Year 7 [***] $ [***] $ [***] $ 109,000,000 Total $ [***] $ [***] $150,000,000 N/A\n\n(a) Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitments. With respect to each Contract Year, by no later than [***], Ginkgo shall have incurred (including all credits and offsets permitted under this Agreement) at least, in the aggregate since the beginning of the Term, the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment amount for such Contract Year. The Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitments for each of Contract Years [***] are binding commitments. Any amounts paid by Ginkgo to BLI in excess of the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment amount for a given Contract Year in Contract Years [***], regardless of whether such excess constitutes a Development Purchase or Production Purchase, will be creditable towards the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment in subsequent Contract Year(s) until such excess amount has been fully credited. Ginkgo covenants to pay the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitments for each Contract Year by the [***] Business Day after the end of the [***]. If BLI has Substantially Completed at least [***] ([***]) [***] Workflows within the first [***] ([***]) Contract Years, then the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment as of the Contract Year (which may include a portion of a full Contract Year) that is the last Contract Year during the Term pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall change from $109 million (as currently reflected in Table 7.2.2) to $150 million.\n\n(b) Development Purchase Commitments.\n\n(i) Subject to Section 7.2.2(a) (Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitments), unless the Parties otherwise mutually agree in writing, the Development Purchase Commitment for the [***] Contract Years shall constitute a binding obligation on Ginkgo, and, subject to Ginkgo exercising its Buy-Down Option pursuant to Section 7.3 (Buy-Down Election), the Development Purchase Commitment for the [***] Contract Years shall also constitute binding obligations on Ginkgo. No less than [***] percent ([***]%) of the Development Purchases made in the [***] Contract Years will be used by the Parties to develop Workflows for [***]. Page 37 of 85\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii) At any time during a Contract Year, upon written notice to the JRC, Ginkgo may accelerate its Development Purchases in such Contract Year to include Development Purchases anticipated to be made in upcoming Contract Year(s). Such additional Development Purchases in excess of the Development Purchase Commitment for such Contract Year will be creditable towards Ginkgo's Development Purchases in subsequent Contract Year(s) until such excess amount has been exhausted and will count towards the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment for the Contract Year in which it is paid, subject to allocation to subsequent Contract Year(s) as set forth in Section 7.2.2(a) (Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitments).\n\n(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event that Ginkgo's Development Purchases in a given Contract Year after [***] are less than the Development Purchase Commitment for such Contract Year, respectively, Ginkgo shall be able to apply the Development Purchases made in the first [***] of the next Contract Year to satisfy the previous Contract Year's Development Purchase Commitment; provided that (i) Ginkgo may only be able to satisfy [***] percent ([***]%) of the relevant Development Purchase Commitment for the previous Contract Year pursuant to this Section 7.2.2(b)(iii) (Development Purchase Commitments) and (ii) any amount of Development Purchases credited towards satisfying the previous Contract Year's Development Purchase Commitment shall not count towards satisfying such targets for the then-current Contract Year.\n\n(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event that a Workflow Development Plan is terminated prior to completion by the JRC, including (A) [***], (B) [***], (C) [***] or (D) [***], then, subject to Section 3.5.1 (Decision-Making), the JRC shall, in good faith, discuss and approve [***]; provided, however, that such [***] (Term).\n\n(c) Production Purchase Commitments.\n\n(i) Subject to this Section 6.2.2(c) (Production Purchase Commitments), unless the Parties otherwise mutually agree in writing, the Production Purchase Target for the [***] shall constitute a binding obligation on Ginkgo and, in partial satisfaction of its Production Purchase commitment for the Page 38 of 85\n\n\n\n\n\n[***], Ginkgo shall purchase [***] ([***]) [***] within [***] ([***]) days of the Effective Date, the cost of which, for clarity, shall be offset by the upfront payment paid by Ginkgo pursuant to Section 7.1 (Upfront Payment). Subject to Ginkgo's obligation to satisfy the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment for a Contract Year, with respect to the second [***] Contract Years), Ginkgo's Production Purchase Targets for the [***] Contract Years as set forth in Table 7.2.2 are [***], and the Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that [***].\n\n(ii) At any time during a Contract Year, upon written notice to the JRC, Ginkgo may accelerate its Production Purchases in such Contract Year to include Production Purchases anticipated to be made in upcoming Contract Year(s). Such additional Production Purchases in excess of the Production Purchase Target for such Contract Year will be creditable towards Ginkgo's Production Purchases in subsequent Contract Year(s) until such excess amount has been exhausted and will count towards the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment.\n\n(d) Effects of Tolling. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Ginkgo's obligations to satisfy Development Purchase Commitments and Production Purchase Commitments at all times during the Term (including any Intended End of Term) are subject to Section 5.4.3(d) (Tolling) and this Section 7.2.2(d) (Effects of Tolling).

During the Term following the end of the second (2nd) Contract Year, Ginkgo may elect, upon written notice to BLI, to buy- down its remaining financial obligations under the Full Purchase Target (the \"Buy-Down Election\") by making a one-time payment to BLI in the amount of the Buy-Down Amount. In the event Ginkgo notifies BLI of its Buy-Down Election as set forth in this Section 7.3 (Buy-Down Election), then, upon Ginkgo's payment of the Buy-Down Amount to BLI within [***] ([***]) days of Ginkgo's Buy-Down Election, this Agreement shall automatically terminate, with the applicable effects of termination set forth in Section 13.3.2 (Effects of Termination Based Upon Ginkgo's Buy-Down Election).\n\n7.4 Additional Payments.\n\n7.4.1 License Fees. During the Term, and in consideration for the rights granted herein, Ginkgo shall pay field of use license fees (\"FOU License Fees\") as follows: (a) with respect to any calendar year, no FOU License Fees will be due until [***] and (b) [***] ($[***]) per calendar year per Beacon Optofluidic Machine [***] up to a Page 39 of 85\n\n\n\n\n\nmaximum of [***] ($[***]) per calendar year per Beacon Optofluidic Machine; provided that, in no event will the FOU License Fees paid by Ginkgo for use of a Beacon Optofluidic Machine [***]. FOU License Fees shall be applied to Ginkgo's use of all Beacon Optofluidic Machines, [***]. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and without limiting any of Ginkgo's rights and remedies under Applicable Law and this Agreement, [***],\n\n7.4.2 Milestone Payments. In the event that Ginkgo uses any of the BLI Proprietary Workflows identified in Exhibit D to conduct Commercial Services for a Third Party customer and such Commercial Services [***] result in the discovery of an Antibody to be used as the active ingredient in a therapeutic product for which a Third Party [***] (each such Antibody subject to this Section 7.4.2 (Milestone Payments), a \"Discovered Antibody\"), then, on a Discovered Antibody-by-Discovered Antibody basis, in the event such Third Party (a) achieves any of the milestone events noted below in Table 7.4.2 (each, a \"Milestone Event\") with respect to a Discovered Antibody and (b) makes a payment to Ginkgo in connection with such Milestone Event, then Ginkgo will pay BLI [***] percent ([***]%) of such payment received by Ginkgo from such Third Party up to the amount of the corresponding \"Maximum Milestone Payment\" for such milestone event set forth below in Table 7.4.2 (each, a \"Milestone Payment\". Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall a Discovered Antibody include (x) an Antibody [***] (e.g. [***]) through the conduct of Commercial Services by Ginkgo or (y) an Antibody [***]. Table 7.4.2\n\nMilestone Event\n\nMaximum Milestone Payment [***] $ [***] [***] $ [***] [***] $ [***] [***] $ [***]\n\nEach Milestone Payment shall be payable only once for each and every Discovered Antibody.

For example, [***].\n\n7.5 Manner of Payments. Each payment under this Agreement to a Party will be made in Dollars and by electronic transfer in immediately available funds via either a bank wire transfer, an ACH (automated clearing house) mechanism, or any other means of electronic funds transfer, at such receiving Party's election, to such bank account as the receiving Party will designate in writing to the other Party at least [***] ([***]) Business Days before the payment is due.\n\n7.6 Taxes. It is understood and agreed between the Parties that any payments made by a Party to the other Party under this Agreement are exclusive of any sales tax, value added tax (if any) or similar tax (\"VAT\") upon such payments. Where VAT is properly added to a payment made under this Agreement, the Party making the payment will pay the amount of VAT only on Page 40 of 85\n\n\n\n\n\nreceipt of a valid tax invoice issued in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country in which the VAT is chargeable. If a Party is required to deduct or withhold from any payment due hereunder any taxes in the nature of a tax upon or measured by income, then the Parties shall work together to ensure, subject to this Section 7.6 (Taxes), that the withholding Party is able to comply with its obligations under Applicable Law and that the non- withholding Party still receives the net amount due to it following payment of such tax by the withholding Party.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that, due to (a) [***], (b) [***], (c) [***], (d) [***] or (e) [***], with respect to each, VAT or other taxes are imposed on payments made by Ginkgo or BLI, as applicable, to the other Party that were not otherwise applicable (\"Incremental Withholding Taxes\"), the Party that took such action resulting in Incremental Withholding Taxes (together with any subsequent successor or assign, \"Responsible Tax Party\") shall be solely responsible for and shall solely bear the amount of such Incremental Withholding Taxes. If the other Party receives a refund or tax credit in connection with the Incremental Withholding Taxes, then such other Party shall promptly pay the Responsible Tax Party an amount equal to the amount of such refund or tax credit.\n\n7.7 Financial and Other Records. Each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, keep complete and accurate books and records pertaining to its activities conducted and costs incurred under this Agreement (including each approved Workflow Development Plan), including with respect to Budget spending, Development Purchases, Production Purchases, FOU License Fees and Milestone Payments, in sufficient detail to calculate all amounts payable hereunder and to verify compliance with its obligations under this Agreement. Such books and records shall be retained by such Party and its Affiliates until [***] ([***]) years after the end of the period to which such books and records pertain or for such longer period as may be required by Applicable Law.\n\n7.8 Audits.

The accounting firm will execute a reasonable written confidentiality agreement with the audited Party and will disclose to the auditing Party only such information as is reasonably necessary to provide the auditing Party with information regarding any actual or potential discrepancies between the amounts actually paid and the amounts payable under this Agreement. The accounting firm's report will [***] be delivered to each Party at the same time and will be deemed final [***] ([***]) business days after it is received by both Parties. The auditing Party shall bear the full cost of any such audit, unless the accounting firm's report discloses an overpayment (or underpayment) by the auditing Party of more than [***] percent ([***]%) of the amount due for any Calendar Quarter, in which case the audited Party shall bear the full cost of such audit. The audited Party shall pay the amount of any overpayment (or underpayment) disclosed in the accounting firm's report, together with interest thereon from the date such payment was originally due, within [***] ([***]) days after delivery to the Parties of the accounting firm's report.

Ginkgo will indemnify, defend and hold BLI and its Affiliates, and its and their officers, directors, employees, Permitted Subcontractors and agents (each, an \"BLI Indemnitee\") harmless from and against any and all Claims and Losses, to the extent caused by or arising as a result of (a) the breach by Ginkgo of this Agreement or material inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by Ginkgo under this Agreement, (b) the negligence, gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct by a Ginkgo Indemnitee in connection with this Agreement, (c) [***] and (d) any Claims by Ginkgo's employees, Permitted Subcontractors or agents for worker's compensation or other liability coverage, insurance, benefits, and other employee-related claims, and (e) the development, manufacture, use, handling, storage, importation, distribution, sale or other commercialization of Ginkgo Inventions by Ginkgo Page 55 of 85\n\n\n\n\n\nor its Affiliates, agents, licensees, sublicensees or customers, in each case of clauses (a)-(e) of this Section 12.2 (Indemnification by Ginkgo) except to the extent BLI has an obligation to indemnify a Ginkgo Indemnitee in connection with such Claims and Losses pursuant to Section 12.1 (Indemnification by BLI).\n\n12.3 Procedure.

The Party seeking indemnification will reasonably cooperate with the indemnifying Party in the defense of any such Claim at the cost of the indemnifying Party. An indemnifying Party will not be obligated to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Party seeking indemnification if, and only to the extent, the Party seeking indemnification delays providing notice of a Claim to the indemnifying Party and the delay in notice substantively prejudices the ability of the indemnifying Party to successfully defend the Claim. The indemnifying Party may not make any admission on behalf of the Party seeking indemnification [***]. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Party seeking indemnification may at any time choose to be represented by its own counsel at its expense (or at the indemnifying Party's expense if the indemnifying Party's defense is inadequate as determined by a reasonableness standard).\n\n12.4 Insurance.

The insurance policies will be under an occurrence form, but if only a claims-made form is available to a Party, then such Party will continue to maintain such insurance after Expiration or the termination of this Agreement for a period of [***] ([***]) years following the end of the Term. 13.

If either Party commits a material breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement, then the other Party may give the breaching Party written notice of such material breach. If the breaching Party fails to cure such breach within sixty (60) days after such notice, then the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the breaching Party in its entirety. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the breaching Party has a bona fide dispute as to whether such breach has occurred or has been cured, it will so notify the non- breaching Party in writing and the cure period will be tolled until such dispute is resolved pursuant to Section 14.5.2 (Dispute Resolution). Upon a final determination of breach or failure to cure, the breaching Party will have the remainder of the cure period to cure such breach. [***].\n\n13.2.2 Bankruptcy. Each Party will have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately in its entirety by giving written notice of termination to the other Party, if the other Party files a voluntary petition, or if an involuntary petition is granted in respect of the other Party and appeal proceedings are not commenced within [***] ([***]) Business Days from the date of such petition under the bankruptcy provisions of Applicable Law, or the other Party is declared insolvent, undergoes voluntary or involuntary dissolution, or makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or suffers the appointment of a receiver or trustee over all, or substantially all, of its assets or properties. All rights and licenses under or to Intellectual Property granted under or pursuant to this Agreement by one Party to the other are, and will otherwise be deemed to be, for purposes of Section 365(n) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, licenses of rights to \"intellectual property\" as defined under Article 101 (52) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Parties agree that each Party will retain and may fully exercise all of its rights and elections under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or such similar laws in a jurisdiction outside the United States.

In the event that termination is the result of an uncured, material Ginkgo breach of the Agreement under Section 13.2.1 (Material Breach), for Ginkgo's insolvency pursuant to Section 13.2.2 (Bankruptcy) or for an Extended Force Majeure Event with respect to Ginkgo pursuant to Section 14.8 (Force Majeure), then, as of the effective date of termination: (a) any and all existing Headstart Periods shall immediately be deemed to have accelerated to conclusion, (b) the restrictions on BLI set forth in Section 6.2.1 (Restrictions on BLI) shall immediately deemed to have terminated; (c) the licenses granted to BLI from Ginkgo pursuant to Section 9.2 (Grants to BLI) shall survive, (d) the licenses granted to Ginkgo under Sections 9.1.1(c) (Grants to Ginkgo - Commercial License) and 9.1.2 (License Grant to Page 58 of 85\n\n\n\n\n\nExploit [***]) shall survive, but shall convert immediately into royalty-bearing licenses as set forth in subclause (e) hereof, (e) Ginkgo shall to pay to BLI [***]; provided that in the event such uncured material breach is [***], Ginkgo, at its election to be made on or before the [***] ([***]t h) day following the effective date of termination (or, if later, within [***] ([***]) days of learning of the relevant royalties for Licensed Products), may elect, in lieu of royalties, to pay to BLI [***]; (f) the pricing terms for Beacon Optofluidic Machines, Consumables, and services (including Services) shall be consistent with then-current BLI List Prices; and (g) Ginkgo shall pay BLI for any amounts due for work performed by BLI under and in accordance with this Agreement prior to the effective date of termination or materials ordered prior to the effective date of termination to the extent that BLI cannot reasonably cancel or reallocate such work or materials.\n\n13.3.4 Effects of Termination Based Upon an Uncured BLI Breach or Insolvency. In the event that termination is the result of an uncured material BLI breach of the Agreement under Section 13.2.1 (Material Breach) or for BLI's insolvency pursuant to Section 13.2.2 (Bankruptcy), then: (a) Ginkgo's obligations to pay to BLI the Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment under Section 7.2.2(a) (Contract Year Purchase Targets and Commitments) shall terminate, (b) BLI shall grant royalty-free status on all Licensed Products developed using the Beacon Platform and no royalties shall be payable by Ginkgo on any sale or transfer of such Licensed Products, (c) Ginkgo's obligations to pay to BLI the FOU License Fees pursuant to Section 7.4.1 (License Fees) shall terminate, (d) the licenses granted to Ginkgo from BLI in Section 9.1.1 (Scope of Grants) and 9.1.2 (License Grant to Exploit [***]) shall survive [***], (e) the licenses granted to BLI from Ginkgo pursuant to Section 9.2 (Grants to BLI) shall terminate, except with respect to any sublicenses granted by BLI under Section 9.2.2 for products and processes that were sold, commercialized or performed by BLI or to or for Third Parties prior to termination, which shall survive and such termination, but only if such sublicenses were granted in accordance with this Agreement, (f) the pricing terms for Beacon Optofluidic Machines, Consumables, and services (including Services) set forth in Section 5.2.2 (Pricing - Adjustments) shall survive for a period of [***] from the effective date of termination, (g) the restrictions on BLI set forth in Section 6.2.1 (Restrictions on BLI) shall survive to the extent set forth therein and (h) any and all existing Headstart Periods shall survive for their duration. If any such uncured, material BLI breach is solely due to BLI's material failure to perform its supply-related obligations under this Agreement, Section 13.4 (Rights in Lieu of Termination for BLI's Material Breach of Supply Obligations) may apply in Ginkgo's sole discretion.\n\n13.3.5 Effects of Termination Based Upon Ginkgo's Election to Terminate based on a BLI Extended Force Majeure Event. In the event that termination is elected by Ginkgo based upon an Extended Force Majeure Event with respect to BLI pursuant to Section 13.2.1 (Force Majeure), then, as of the effective date of termination: (a) any and all existing Headstart Periods shall survive for their duration as if this Agreement had not been terminated, (b) the restrictions on BLI set forth in Section 6.2.1 (Restrictions on BLI) shall survive to the extent set forth therein as if this Agreement had not been terminated; (c) the licenses granted to Ginkgo from BLI in Section 9.1.1 (Scope of Grants) and 9.1.2 (License Grant to Exploit [***]) shall survive and become perpetual, irrevocable and, subject to clause (f) of this Section 13.3.2, royalty-free; (d) the licenses granted to BLI Page 59 of 85\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom Ginkgo pursuant to Section 9.2 (Grants to BLI) shall survive; (e) any Licensed Products arising from Collaboration Workflows or Ginkgo Workflows developed or used by Ginkgo to good effect prior to the effective date of termination shall be royalty-free and no royalties shall be payable by Ginkgo on any sale or transfer of such Licensed Product; provided that, if [***], if [***], then, in order for the sale or transfer of Licensed Products arising from Collaboration Workflows or Ginkgo Workflows developed or used by Ginkgo to good effect prior to the effective date of termination to be royalty-free, Ginkgo must pay to BLI [***], but Ginkgo will have [***] ([***]) days following the effective date of termination to decide whether to make such payment to BLI or to pay royalties for such Licensed Products under subclause (f) of this Section 13.3.5 (Effects of Termination Based Upon Ginkgo's Election to Terminate based on a BLI Extended Force Majeure Event), (f) (i) for any Licensed Products arising from Workflows other than as set forth in subclause (e) of this Section 13.3.5 (Effects of Termination Based Upon Ginkgo's Election to Terminate based on a BLI Extended Force Majeure Event), Ginkgo shall pay [***] and (ii) Ginkgo shall pay [***]; provided that, if [***], then [***], (g) the pricing terms for Beacon Optofluidic Machines, Consumables, and services (including Services) shall be consistent with then-current BLI List Prices and (h) Ginkgo shall pay BLI for any amounts due for work performed by BLI under and in accordance with this Agreement prior to the effective date of termination to the extent that BLI cannot reasonably cancel or reallocate such work.\n\n13.3.6 Non-Limitation of Remedies.

Neither Party has any authority to enter into any contracts or assume any obligations for the other. Page 62 of 85\n\n\n\n\n\n14.3 Severability.

This Agreement will be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any choice of law provision.\n\n14.5.2 Dispute Resolution. Except with respect to those disputes in which a Party seeks equitable relief pursuant to Section 14.5.3 (Equitable Remedies) or for which a Party or Person is expressly given final decision-making authority as set forth in Section 3.5 (Decision-Making), the Parties, through their Senior Officers, will make a good faith effort to settle any disputes that may arise between them with respect to this Agreement. If the Parties do not settle the matter within [***] ([***]) days after the delivery by one Party of written notice (the \"Arbitration Notice\") to the other Party involved, then the Parties will submit the matter to binding arbitration in Wilmington, Delaware. All matters so submitted to arbitration will be settled by three (3) arbitrators in accordance with the [***], or its successor (the \"[***] Rules\"). In the event of a conflict between [***] Rules and this Agreement, this Agreement shall govern. Each Party will designate an arbitrator and the Parties will cause the designated arbitrators to mutually agree upon and to designate a third arbitrator who will serve as chairperson; provided, however, that failing such agreement within [***] ([***]) days of delivery of the Arbitration Notice, the third (3rd) arbitrator will be appointed in accordance with [***] Rules within an additional [***] ([***]) days. The Parties shall arrange for a hearing to occur and be completed within [***] ([***]) days after the appointment of the third (3rd) arbitrator, which hearing shall last no longer than [***], unless the arbitral panel believes a longer period is required, in which case the hearing may last [***]. The Parties will cause the arbitrators to decide the matter to be arbitrated within [***] ([***]) days after the close of evidence unless the chairperson arbitrator determines, at the request of any Party or on his or her own initiative, that such time period should be extended, in which case such time period may not be extended beyond an additional [***] ([***]) day period.

Each Party covenants and agrees that (a) it will produce documents as required by this Section 14.5.2 (Dispute Resolution), and (b) it will make its employees, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to make its former employees, available for depositions and hearing testimony as requested by the other Party. The final decision of the majority of the arbitrators shall be in writing, in all events follow governing law and will be furnished to all the Parties in such dispute. Judgment on such decision may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Such decision may be used in a court of law only for the purpose of seeking enforcement of the arbitrators' award. Except as required by Applicable Law or to enforce an arbitrators' award, neither Party may disclose the existence, contents or results of an arbitration brought in accordance with this Agreement, or the evidence produced by its opposing Parties, or any analysis or summaries derived from such evidence. The Parties agree that all applicable statutes of limitation and Page 64 of 85\n\n\n\n\n\ntime-based defenses (such as estoppel and laches) will be tolled while the procedures set forth in this Section 14.5.2 (Dispute Resolution) are pending.

At all times while any claim, action, suit or other proceeding between the Parties and/or any of their Affiliates (or among the Parties and/or any of their Affiliates and one or more Third Parties) arising out of or relating to this Agreement is pending in any court of competent jurisdiction, no dispute that is justiciable and can be joined to such pending claim, action, suit or other proceeding shall be submitted to arbitration pursuant to Section 14.5.2 (Dispute Resolution) without both Parties' mutual consent and, instead, either Party may join such dispute to the pending claim, action, suit or other proceeding by including such dispute in its pleadings or amending its pleadings. In the event that a motion to amend is required to achieve such joinder, the non- moving Party shall consent to such motion.\n\n14.6 Entire Agreement; Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement, together with the Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto, sets forth and constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and all prior agreements, understandings, promises and representations, whether written or oral, with respect thereto are superseded hereby. This Agreement may not be amended except by a writing signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. The failure of a Party at any time or times to require performance of any provision hereof will in no manner affect its rights at a later time to enforce the same.

This Agreement will be written and executed in, and all other communications under or in connection with this Agreement will be in, the English language. Any translation into any other language will not be an official version thereof, and in the event of any conflict in interpretation between the English version and such translation, the English version will control.\n\n14.8 Force Majeure. Any delay in the performance of any of the duties or obligations (other than payment obligations) of either Party hereto caused by a Force Majeure Event (defined below) shall not be considered a breach of this Agreement and the time required for performance shall be extended for a period equal to the period of such delay. \"Force Majeure Event\" shall mean acts of God, acts of the public enemy, war, terrorism, insurrections, riots, injunctions, embargoes, fires, explosions, floods, or other unforeseeable causes beyond the reasonable control and without the fault or negligence of the Party who is so prevented or delayed from fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement by such Force Majeure Event (the \"Affected Party\"). The Affected Party shall give prompt written notice to the other Party of such cause and shall take whatever reasonable steps are appropriate in the other Party's discretion to relieve the effect of such cause as rapidly as possible. The Party not directly affected by the Force Majeure Event shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with written notice effective upon receipt if Force Page 65 of 85\n\n\n\n\n\nMajeure Event continues to prevent performance or compliance in any material respect by the other Party for a period of more than [***] ([***]) days or should [***] ([***]) Force Majeure Events apply to the performance of such other Party during any [***] (each a \"Extended Force Majeure Event\").\n\n14.9 Further Assurances. Each Party will duly execute and deliver, or cause to be duly executed and delivered, such further instruments and do and cause to be done such further acts and things, including the filing of such assignments, agreements, documents, and instruments, as may be necessary or as the other Party may reasonably request in connection with this Agreement or to carry out more effectively the provisions and purposes hereof, or to better assure and confirm unto such other Party its rights and remedies under this Agreement.\n\n14.10 Third Party Beneficiaries. There are no Third Party beneficiaries under this Agreement, except to the extent a Third Party is indemnified pursuant to Article 12 (Indemnification; Insurance); provided that, in no event will any Third Party entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article 12 (Indemnification; Insurance) be allowed to enforce the terms thereof against a Party.\n\n14.11 Export Control. This Agreement is made subject to any restrictions concerning the export of products or technical information from the United States or other countries which may be imposed upon the Parties from time to time. Each Party agrees that it will not export, directly or indirectly, any technical information acquired from the other Party under this Agreement or any products using such technical information to a location or in a manner that at the time of export requires an export license or other governmental approval, without first obtaining the applicable license, approval, or written consent to do so from the appropriate agency or other governmental entity.\n\n14.12 References.

In the event of any inconsistencies between this Agreement and any Exhibits, Schedules or other attachments hereto, the terms of this Agreement will control, unless the relevant Exhibit, Schedule or other attachment explicitly references its inconsistency with this Agreement and states that it shall control.\n\n14.14 Non-Solicit. Neither Party will, [***], directly or indirectly with or through any Person, solicit for employment any Person who is an employee of the other Party; provided, however, that general solicitation of the public for employment shall not constitute a solicitation hereunder so long as such general solicitation is not designed to target any such Person.

In the event that Carrier agrees to provide, at the request of Shipper, transportation which constitutes a backhaul or a continuous movement under these provisions, the rate or charge otherwise applicable on said shipment(s) shall not be applied, and the applicable charge shall be that provided in accordance with the backhaul or continuous movement rates set forth in Rate Appendices hereto. Shipper shall be responsible for payment of all freight charges on backhaul or continuous movement shipments.\n\n3. Route applicable.\n\n   (a) Mileage shall be computed based on the aggregate number of miles  traversed in connection with a backhaul or continuous movement shipment, in  accordance with the mileage determination provisions herein, commencing at the  terminal from which Carrier's unit was initially dispatched and ending with  return thereto, computed as follows: (i) the mileage traversed between Carrier's terminal and the point of origin of the initial shipment; plus (ii) the mileage  traversed between the origin and destination of any shipment and the origin of  the next consecutive shipment; plus (iv) the mileage traversed between the point of destination of the last shipment and the Carrier's terminal; plus (v) all additional mileage traversed incidental to any of the mileages specified in subparagraphs (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) hereof, for purposes of internal cleaning of trailer, weighing, stop-off for partial loading and/or unloading, detour necessitated by highway restrictions or weight limitations, or by compliance with statutes or regulations of any governmental unit or agency thereof.\n\n   (b) When the trailer of any unit used for a backhaul or continuous movement  shipment is located at the point of origin of the initial shipment, and if  tractor mileage charges and/or trailer rental charges are assessed in  connection therewith pursuant to applicable provisions of these Rules and  Regulations, the route of backhaul or continuous movement shall commence and end at the said point of origin.\n\n   (c) Each freight bill in a backhaul or continuous movement must be  cross-referenced to the freight bill covering the initial shipment.\n\n4.  Cleaning.\n\n    Shipper and/or Consignee of the return load shall, at its expense, have the  interior of the tank cleaned so it can handle the return shipment satisfactorily; or Shipper may request Carrier to have the interior cleaned, and a cleaning charge of $125.00 shall apply.\n\nITEM 230:       MIXED SHIPMENT - TRUCKLOAD\n\nTwo or more commodities taking the same or different rates may be shipped as a  truckload at one time in a compartmented trailer. On such shipments, freight  charges shall be computed on basis of the actual gallonage or weight of each  commodity, as the case may be, at its respective rate, but not less than the  charges that would accrue on basis of the highest rate and corresponding minimum gallonage and/or weight as provided in Item 285 (Weight) or in individual Items.\n\nITEM 235:       FRACTIONS\n\nIn computing freight charges or mileage, all fractions must be retained at their full value until the final result is obtained, and then all remaining fractions  will be disposed of in the following manner:                                  Fractions of less than 1/2 cent, reduce to the next lowest cent.                 Fractions of 1/2 cent or more, increase to the next full cent.\n\n  ITEM 240:       PICKUP OR DELIVERY SERVICE\n\nCarrier's rates include, as to each shipment, one pick-up and one delivery at a  place directly accessible to Carrier's unit at all points within the limits of  the cities, towns, villages and other points from and to which the rates apply.\n\n                The term \"pick-up\" as used herein means the service performed by                 Carrier in calling for and accepting a shipment.\n\n                The term \"delivery\" as used herein means the service performed                 by Carrier in transporting and placing a unit as designated by                 the Consignee for unloading.\n\nITEM 245:       HOLIDAYS\n\nThe following shall be deemed Holidays:\n\nNew Year's Day  Independence Day   Thanksgiving Day   Memorial Day   Labor Day Christmas Day\n\nITEM 250:       PREPAYMENT\n\nShipper shall prepay of all charges or provide satisfactory assurance of payment before Carrier accepts shipments.\n\n\n\n\n\nITEM 260:       RETURN SHIPMENTS - TENDERED FOR VEHICLES ENROUTE\n\nSubject to all other provisions herein, shipments on vehicles enroute under  previous dispatch will be accepted subject to the following conditions:\n\n1.  The rate to apply will be 80% of the otherwise applicable distance commodity     rate, other than a rate under Item 220 (Backhauls and Continuous Movements),     subject to the applicable minimum.\n\n2.  Shipments may not originate in Louisiana or Texas, and must be destined to     points in the United States in or east of Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma     and Texas.\n\n3.  The provisions of this Item will only apply on distance commodity scales in      excess of 400 miles.\n\nITEM 263:       RECONSIGNMENT OR DIVERSION\n\n1.  The terms \"diversion\" or \"reconsignment\" mean:\n\n    (a) A change in name of Consignor or Consignee.     (b) A change in destination.     (c) Any other instructions given by the Consignor, Consignee, or owner         affecting routing, loading or delivery and requiring an addition to or         change in billing or additional movement of the vehicle or both. And         additional movement of a vehicle from one point to another point or         points within the same loading or unloading facilities to finish loading         or unloading, as the case may be, shall not be considered a diversion or         reconsignment under the provisions of this Item.\n\n2.  Shipments moving under the provisions of this Item must be prepaid.\n\n3.  A request for diversion or reconsignment must be made or confirmed in     writing. The original shipping documents must be surrendered to Carrier or     proof of ownership by other means must be provided.\n\n4.  The rate to be applied shall be the applicable rate from original point of     origin to final destination based on the miles traveled via reconsigning or     diversion point or, where more than one reconsignment is involved, via each     successive reconsigning point.\n\n5.  A charge of $30.00 will be made for each diversion or reconsignment.\n\n6.  When a diversion or reconsignment order is received by Carrier, reasonable     efforts will be made to locate the shipment and effect the change desired,     but Carrier will not be responsible for failure to do so unless such failure     is due to the gross negligence of its employees.\n\nITEM 265:       REJECTED, UNDELIVERED SHIPMENTS\n\nIf, for reasons not attributable to Carrier, a shipment is rejected wholly or in part by Consignee at destination, it shall be returned at that time in the delivering unit to the point of origin unless reconsigned to another unloading point by Shipper.\n\nThe rate for return movement of a rejected or undelivered shipment will be  one-half of the rate on the outbound movement in effect on the date of the  return movement. Charges will be based on the actual amount of commodities  returned, subject to the outbound minimum.\n\nTime consumed waiting for orders, under this Item will be considered part of the unloading time, and detention charges will be assessed as provided in Item 525  (Detention of Vehicles).\n\nIf the return movement is rated under Item 260 (Return Shipments - Tendered for  Vehicles Enroute) or Item 220 (Backhauls and Continuous Movements), the rates  applicable thereunder shall apply.\n\nITEM 270:       SHIPMENTS TO AND FROM POINTS IN CANADA AND MEXICO\n\nOn shipments to and from points in Canada or to and from points in Mexico, the  rates in schedules making reference hereto apply only as proportional rates to  and from United States ports of entry at the United States-Mexican border.\n\nShipper shall advise Carrier at time service is requested of the route and the  United States port of entry to be used for movement beyond the United States  border. If Shipper fails to advise or chooses not to advise the port of entry  and/or route to be followed beyond the border, the Carrier shall do so. Upon  selection of such route and/or port of entry by Carrier, the Consignor shall be  deemed to accept such route and/or port of entry as its own routing without  recourse to the Carrier.\n\nITEM 280:       WEIGHING AND WEIGHTS\n\n1.  When a weighing service is performed by Carrier, either at the request of     the Shipper or Consignee, or when weighing is required to determine     assessment of freight charges, a weighing service charge of $7.50 will be     assessed for each service; provided however, no charge will be assessed when     weighing is accomplished on Consignor's or Consignee's plant scales, at the     point of loading or unloading, at no cost to Carrier.\n\n2.  If it is necessary to deviate from the shortest applicable route of movement     in order to weigh enroute or comply with Shipper or Consignee request to     weigh enroute, the freight rate will be based on distance from origin to     destination via such weigh point.\n\n\n\n\n\n      In the event out-of-line weighing is required of Carrier, commodity rates     will become applicable, and mileage rates will be used to assess freight     charges.\n\n3.  If a shipment exceeds the maximum weight which can be legally transported in     the unit loaded and it is necessary to return to origin or some other point     designated for partial unloading, the freight rate will be based on the     total distance from origin to destination via such weigh point and/or such     point of partial unloading. Time consumed in effecting partial unloading due     to overweight shall be considered part of the loading time and shall be     subject to the charges and provisions of Item 525 (Detention of Vehicles).\n\n    Commodity rates will become inapplicable in the event the provisions of this     paragraph are applicable, and the mileage rates will be used to assess     freight charges.\n\n4.  Time consumed in (1) weighing vehicle before and after loading or before and     after individual compartments are loaded and (2) weighing vehicle before and     after unloading or before and after unloading individual compartments, shall     be considered a part of the loading or unloading time, as the case may be,     and shall be subject to Item 525 (Detention of Vehicles); provided, however,     when Carrier is requested to arrive at Shipper's facility with a tare weight     prior to loading or at Consignee's facility with a gross weight after     loading or tare weight after unloading, without returning to the Shipper's     or Consignee's facility, such weighing time shall not be subject to     provisions of Item 525 (Detention of Vehicles).\n\n  5.  Carrier will assess freight charges based on scale weights secured at either     origin or destination in accordance with Shipper's instructions appearing on     the freight bill. Carrier will not assume responsibility for differences in     weights secured at origin and destination in accordance with Consignor or     Consignee requests.\n\n6.  The term \"service\" as used in this Item shall mean one weighing empty (or     partial empty) and one weighing loaded (or partially loaded). The     difference in the two weights shall be the weight of the entire shipment or     a portion thereof.\n\nITEM 285:       WEIGHT\n\nCarrier's rates shall apply on actual weight transported subject to applicable  minimum weights. The weight loaded shall not exceed the maximum weight which may lawfully be transported in Carrier's equipment; provided, however, when the  weight of a shipment is less than the minimum weight specified for the  applicable rate, and the rate provides that in no event will freight charges be  based on less than the minimum weight specified, such minimum weight will apply  for the purpose of computing freight charges.\n\nWhen a minimum load is based on 90% of the gallonage capacity of the vehicle,  freight charges will be based on 90% of the gallonage capacity of the vehicle  utilized.\n\nITEM 300:       SHIPMENT DOCUMENTATION AND LOADING AND UNLOADING DIRECTIONS\n\n1.  Upon arrival of Carrier's unit at any Consignor's or Consignee's premises,     Consignor or Consignee, as the case may be, shall be responsible for     examining and validating the documentation connected with the shipment. In     addition, Consignor or Consignee shall be responsible for directing the unit     to the proper loading or unloading facilities and for connecting and     disconnecting Carrier's hose to the loading or unloading facilities; Carrier     shall only connect and disconnect Carrier's hose to Carrier's equipment.\n\n2.  Each vehicle offered to the Consignor for loading of the commodity to be     transported is subject to inspection by Consignor; the acceptance of such     vehicles for loading by Consignor shall constitute notice to Carrier that     said vehicle meets Consignor's requirements with respect to specifications,     cleanliness, pumping equipment, hoses and connections.\n\n3.  Consignor shall provide all placards required for each shipment in      conformity with regulations of the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n\nITEM 305:       LOADING BY CONSIGNOR - UNLOADING BY CONSIGNEE\n\nExcept as otherwise provided, Carrier's rates and charges do not include the  service of the Carrier in loading or unloading.\n\nCarrier's driver will assist Consignor or Consignee in loading or unloading operations where the assistance is requested. This service will be rendered, however, only under the direction of Shipper, and Carrier will assume no responsibility for errors or omissions made in the course of such operations unless complete written instructions are supplied to Carrier's dispatchers before the shipment is dispatched and then only if such errors or omissions are due to the negligence of Carrier's employees; provided, however, that under no circumstances shall Carrier's employees connect or disconnect Carrier's hose to the loading or unloading facilities.\n\nITEM 310:       CLEANING\n\nExcept as otherwise provided, Carrier shall be responsible for cleaning the  trailer and disposal of all commodity heels and wash water following each  shipment using Carrier's trailers, and no charges to Consignor or Consignee  shall apply because of such cleaning or disposal. Shipper shall be responsible  for cleaning any trailers owned or furnished by Shipper and used by Carrier.\n\n\n\n\n\nITEM 320:       DELIVERY SCHEDULES\n\nCarrier shall handle shipments tendered to it with reasonable dispatch and  effect delivery of such shipments during Normal Business Hours, unless Carrier  has been advised prior to the shipment being dispatched that the Consignee has  extended its hours of business and/or days of operation. Under no circumstances  shall Carrier be obligated to effect delivery of any shipment at a specified  time or on a specified day. In consideration of the convenience of the  Consignee, Carrier will accept orders calling for preferred delivery periods of  either morning (a.m.) or afternoon (p.m.) and will make reasonable efforts to  comply with such requests, subject to the understanding that failure to arrive  during such preferred delivery period will not relieve the Consignee of the  responsibility to accept delivery of the shipment tendered during its Normal  Business Hours.\n\nITEM 330:       DETOUR ROUTES\n\nIf due to floods, washouts, snow, ice, road construction or other conditions beyond the control of Carrier, any portion of the shortline route, from origin to destination, as determined from the governing mileage guide, cannot in Carrier's sole judgement safely be traversed by Carrier's vehicle, Carrier will detour the shipment over the most practical available route, and a notation will be placed on all shipping papers and freight bills indicating the route of movement. The applicable distance commodity rates will apply to the actual route of movement.\n\nITEM 340:       IMPRACTICABLE OPERATIONS\n\n1.  Nothing herein shall be construed as requiring Carrier to transport     commodities or furnish service for which, in Carrier's sole judgment, it     does not have sufficient operational experience or suitable equipment nor to     accept shipments when equipment is not available.\n\n2.  Nothing herein shall require Carrier to pick up, transport or deliver     shipments when, through no fault or neglect of Carrier, it is impractical or     unsafe to do so.\n\nITEM 350:       SPECIAL SERVICE\n\n1.  During the time the normal operations of Shipper's plant are interrupted by     labor disturbances accompanied by violence or imminent threat thereof,     Carrier may dispatch vehicles or units to pick up shipments. If Carrier is     not permitted to enter the plant because of picketing or any other condition     due to labor disputes accompanied by violence or imminent threat thereof,     the order shall be considered to have been cancelled, and the provisions of     Item 590 (Vehicle Furnished But Not Used) shall apply.      2.  If Carrier is not permitted to enter the premises of a Consignee at the     point of destination for delivery of a shipment due to labor disputes     accompanied by violence or imminent threat thereof, the shipment shall be     considered to have been refused or rejected, and the provisions of Item     265 (Returned, Undelivered Shipments - Rejected) shall apply.\n\n3.  Upon request of Shipper, Carrier may furnish additional personnel, if     available, to assist in the loading or unloading at a location which is     involved in a labor dispute accompanied by violence or imminent threat     thereof. The charge for furnishing personnel hereunder shall be $20.00 per     person per hour, subject to a minimum charge of $80.00 per person. Time     shall be computed from the time a person leaves the point of dispatch until     his return. In addition, Shipper shall reimburse Carrier for all travel,     lodging and other expenses incurred for such personnel during the time this     charge applies.\n\nITEM 360:       STOPOFFS\n\n1.  Except as otherwise provided, shipments moving at Carrier's distance     commodity rates may be stopped in transit at not more than two points     enroute between original point of origin and final point of destination to     complete loading or to partially unload or both. Charges on such shipments     must be prepaid.\n\n2.  Shipments stopped in transit to partially unload may be delivered to two or     more Consignees at two or more destinations or to two or more Consignees     within the corporate limits of any one city or town.\n\n  3. Shipments loaded or unloaded, as the case may be, at two or more points    within the corporate limits of the same city or town shall be considered as    being stopped in transit for partial loading or unloading under the    provisions of this Item.\n\n4. If Shipper wishes a shipment to be partially loaded at more than one place of    loading and/or partially, discharged at more than one place of unloading, and    if such places of loading are all included within the corporate limits of a    single municipality, or if such places of unloading are all included within    the corporate limits of a single municipality, a charge of $75.00 per stop    will be made for each pick-up and/or delivery, exclusive of the original     pick-up and the final delivery.\n\n5. If Shipper wishes a shipment partially loaded at more than one place of    loading and/or partially discharged at more than one place of unloading, and    if such places of loading are not included within the corporate limits of a    single municipality, or if such places of unloading are not all included    within the corporate limits of a single municipality, the applicable rate    shall be based on the mileage from point of origin to final destination over\n\n\n\n\n\n   the route of actual movement as per Shipper's instructions, computed in    accordance with Item 217 (Distances-Method of Computing). A charge of $60.00    will be made for each stop to unload, or to partially unload, exclusive of    the initial stop at origin and the final stop at destination.\n\n6. On stops for partial loading and/or unloading, as described above, one hour    free time will be allowed at each loading or unloading point. Time consumed    waiting for orders will be considered part of loading and/or unloading time.    Total free time allowable under provisions of this paragraph shall be not    less than that applicable under the provisions of Item 525 (Detention of    Vehicles).\n\n7. Shipments consigned as stop-off for partial loading and/or unloading must be    prepaid by Shipper. Prepayment will include responsibility by the Shipper for    line-haul freight, demurrage, storage, stop-off, pumping, and other charges    as provided herein, which may accrue at the origin, destination, stop-off    points, designated border crossing, or transfer point.\n\n8. The first stop for partial unloading may not be made until all stops for    partial loading have been completed and no further loading may take place    after the first unloading stop.\n\nITEM 370: TENDER OF SHIPMENTS\n\nShipper shall make timely tender of a Shipment by placing an order for service  with Carrier at least:    (a) twelve (12) hours, or    (b) three (3) hours plus one (1) hour for each forty-five (45) miles between        Carrier's terminal from which the unit to transport the Shipment will be        dispatched and Consignor's facilities,\n\nwhichever is greater, prior to the requested loading time.\n\nITEM 375: TANK VEHICLES OR OTHER EQUIPMENT ORDERED BY THE SHIPPER FOR LOADING\n\nShipper, when placing order for equipment to be loaded, should furnish the  following information:\n\n1. Type of tank vehicles required, if known, such as MC-300 through 305, MC-330,    MC-331, carbon steel, stainless steel, aluminum, stainless steel, insulated,    steam coiled, compartmented, rubber lined, or heater.\n\n   If the type of equipment needed for loading the product is not known by the    Shipper, the Carrier shall be furnished a complete description of the product    to be loaded, such as, flash point, freezing point, weight per gallon,    pressure, if any, toxicity, corrosiveness and other information that would be    helpful in determining the type of equipment needed to safely transport the    product in compliance with the provisions of the Explosives and Dangerous    Articles Tariff described in Item 110 (Governing Publications).\n\n2. Pumping equipment required.\n\n3. Hose required--type and length.\n\n4. Fittings, pipe and hose connections required--size and type.\n\n5. A Material Safety Data Sheet for each commodity to be shipped.\n\nITEM 400: CLAIMS FOR CARGO LOSS OR DAMAGE           I. FILING OF CLAIMS\n\n(a) Claims in writing required. A claim for loss, damage, injury, or delay to      cargo shall not be paid by Carrier unless filed with Carrier in writing, as      provided in subparagraph (b) below. (b) Minimum filing requirements. A claim must be filed with Carrier within     thirty (30) days from the date the shipment in question was delivered, and     (i) contain facts sufficient to identify the shipment (or shipments)     involved (ii) assert the grounds for Carrier's liability for alleged loss,     damage, injury, or delay, and (iii) request payment of a specified or     determinable amount of money. (c) Documents not constituting claims. Bad order reports, appraisal reports of     damage, notations of shortage or damage, or both, on freight bills, delivery     receipts, or other documents, or inspection reports issued by Carrier or     inspection agencies, whether the extent of loss or damage is indicated in     dollars and cents or otherwise, shall, standing alone, not be sufficient to     comply with the requirements of subparagraph (b) above. (d) Claims filed for uncertain amounts. Whenever a claim is presented against     Carrier for an uncertain amount, Carrier shall determine the conditions of     the shipment involved at the time of delivery by it, if it was delivered,     and shall ascertain as nearly as possible the extent, if any, of the loss or     damage for which it may be responsible. It shall not, however, pay a claim     under such circumstances unless and until a formal claim in writing for a     specified or determinable amount of money shall have been filed in     accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (b) above. (e) Other claims. If investigation of a claim reveals that one or more other     carriers have been presented with a similar claim arising out of or relating     to the same shipment, Carrier shall communicate with each such other     Carrier, and prior to any agreement entered into between or among them as to     the proper disposition of such claim or claims, shall notify all claimants     of the receipt of conflicting or overlapping claims and shall require     further substantiation, on the part of each claimant of its title to the     involved commodity or rights with respect to such claim.\n\n          II.  ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF CLAIMS\n\n(a) Carrier shall, upon receipt in writing of a claim meeting the requirements\n\n\n\n\n\n    of subparagraph (b) of Section I of this Item, acknowledge receipt of such     claim in writing to the claimant within 30 days after the date of its     receipt, unless Carrier shall have paid or declined such claim in writing     within said period.\n\n  (b) Carrier shall at the time each claim is received create a separate file and     assign thereto a unique claim file number and note that number on all     correspondence with respect to the claim.\n\n          III. INVESTIGATION OF CLAIMS\n\n(b) Prompt investigation required. Each claim filed against a Carrier in the     manner prescribed herein shall be promptly and thoroughly investigated if     investigation has not already been made prior to receipt of the claim. (b) Supporting documents. When deemed by Carrier to be a necessary part of an     investigation, a claimant shall furnish to Carrier the original freight     bill, evidence of the freight charges, if any, and either the original or a     photocopy of the invoices, or an extract made therefrom, certified by the     claimant to be true and correct with respect to the property and value     involved in the claim, or certification of prices or value, with trade or     other discounts, allowance, or deductions of any nature whatsoever and the     terms thereof, or depreciation reflected thereon. Provided, however, that     where the property involved in a claim has not been invoiced to the     Consignee shown on the freight bill or where an invoice does not show price     or value, or where the property involved has not been sold, or where the     property has been transferred at bookkeeping values only, the Carrier shall,     before paying a claim thereon, require the claimant to establish the     manufactured cost, the quantity shipped, transported or involved and to     certify the correctness thereof in writing.  (c) Verification of loss. No claim for loss of an entire package or an entire     shipment shall be paid by Carrier without a statement in writing from the     Consignee of the shipment involved certifying that the property for which     the claim is filed has not been delivered by or received from any other     source.\n\n          IV.  DISPOSITION OF CLAIMS\n\n(a) Carrier shall pay, decline, or make a firm compromise settlement offer in     writing to the claimant within 120 days after receipt of the claim by     Carrier. Provided, however, that, if the claim cannot be processed and     disposed of within 120 days after receipt thereof, Carrier shall at that     time and at the expiration of each succeeding 60 day period while the claim     remains pending, advise the claimant in writing of the status of the claim     and the reason for the delay in making final disposition thereof.\n\n          V.   PROCESSING OF SALVAGE\n\n(a) Whenever a shipment transported by Carrier is damaged or alleged to be     damaged and is, as a consequence, not delivered or is rejected or refused     upon tender to the owner, Consignee or the person entitled to receive such     shipment, Carrier, after giving due notice, whenever practical to do so, to     the owner and parties that may have an interest therein, and unless advised     to the contrary after giving such notice, shall undertake to sell or dispose     of such commodities directly or by the employment of a competent salvage     agent. Shipper, if requested to do so by Carrier, shall make a good faith     effort to assist Carrier in the disposal or salvage of any damaged,     contaminated or defective shipment. Carrier shall only dispose of the     property in a manner that will fairly and equally protect the best interests     of all persons having an interest therein. Carrier shall make an itemized     record sufficient to identify the commodities involved so as to be able to     correlate that to the shipment or transportation involved, and claim, if     any, filed thereon. Carrier also shall assign to each lot of such property a     successive lot number and note that lot number on its record and shipment of     claim, if any claim is filed thereon. (b) Upon receipt of a claim on a shipment on which salvage has been processed in     the manner herein before prescribed, Carrier shall record in its claim file     thereon the assigned, the amount of money recovered, if any, from the     disposition of such property and the date of transmittal of such money to     the person or persons lawfully entitled to receive the same.\n\nITEM 410: CLAIMS FOR OVERCHARGE, DUPLICATE PAYMENT OR OVERCOLLECTION           I.   DEFINITIONS\n\n(a) \"Overcharge\" means an amount charged that exceeds the applicable rates and     charges for services. It also includes duplicate payments as defined in     paragraph (b) of this section and overcollections as defined in paragraph     (c) of this section when a dispute exists between the parties concerning     such charges. (b) \"Duplicate payment\" means two or more payments for the same service. Where     one or more payment is not in the exact amount of the applicable rates and     charges, refunds shall be made on the basis of the excess amount over the     applicable rates and charges. (c) \"Overcollection\" means the receipt by Carrier of a payment in excess of the      rates and charges applicable to the service in question. (d) \"Unidentified payment\" means a payment which Carrier has received for the     performance of services but which Carrier is unable to match with its open     accounts receivable or otherwise identify as being due. (e) \"Claimant\" means Shipper or any consignee, filing a request with Carrier for     the refund of an overcharge, duplicate payment, or overcollection.\n\n          II.  FILING AND PROCESSING CLAIMS\n\n(a) A claim for overcharge, duplicate payment, or overcollection shall not be     paid unless it is filed in writing with Carrier within nine (9) months from\n\n\n\n\n\n    the date the shipment in question was delivered and unless all freight bills     which are pertinent to the claim have been paid in full.

Diplomat acknowledges and agrees that Tadeo is in the business of designing and hosting Web sites, and that Tadeo shall have the right to provide to third parties services which are the same or similar to the Tadeo Services, and to use or otherwise exploit any Host Materials in providing such services.\n\nSection 9.     DISPUTE RESOLUTION.\n\n(a) In the event that any party to this Agreement has any claim, right or cause of action against any other party to this Agreement, which the parties shall be unable to settle by agreement between themselves, such claim, right or cause of action, to the extent that the relief sought by such party is for monetary damages or awards, shall be determined by arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"),\n\n\n\n\n\nthrough the adjudication by a single arbitrator, in New York, New York, with the decision of such arbitrator to be final and binding upon all parties.

(the \"Agent\"), as follows:\n\n         Section 1. The  Offering.  In accordance  with the Stock  Issuance Plan adopted by its Board of Directors (the \"Plan\"),  the Company will offer and sell up to  1,101,643  shares of its common  stock,  par  value,  $.01 per share (the \"Shares\" or \"Common  Stock\"),  in a  subscription  offering  (the  \"Subscription Offering\") to (1) depositors of the Bank with account balances of $50.00 or more as of September 30, 1998 (\"Eligible  Account  Holders\"),  (2) the Employee Stock Ownership Plan of the Bank (the \"ESOP\"), (3) depositors of the Bank with account balances  of $50.00 or more as of  December  31,  1999  (\"Supplemental  Eligible Account Holders\"), and (4) employees, officers and directors of the Bank.

The discussion                of  statutes  or  regulations  described  or  referred  to in the                Prospectus   are  accurate   summaries  and  fairly  present  the                information   required  to  be  shown.  The  information  in  the                Prospectus relating to the tax consequences of the stock offering                has been  reviewed  by such  counsel  and  fairly  describes  the                opinions  rendered  by Luse Lehman  Gorman  Pomerenk & Schick and                _____________________  to the Company,  the MHC and the Bank with                respect to such matters.\n\n                    (xxiii) The  Company  and the MHC have been duly  registered                and are in good  standing as savings and loan  holding  companies                under the HOLA.\n\n                    (xxiv) In addition, such counsel shall state that during the                preparation of the MHC Application,  the  Registration  Statement                and the Prospectus, they participated in conferences with certain                officers of, the independent public and internal accountants for,                and other  representatives of the Company,  the MHC and the Bank,                at which  conferences  the contents of the MHC  Application,  the                Registration  Statement and the  Prospectus  and related  matters                were  discussed  and,  while such counsel have not  confirmed the                accuracy or completeness of or otherwise verified the information                contained in the MHC Application,  the Registration  Statement or                the  Prospectus,  and do not assume any  responsibility  for such                information,   based  upon  such  conferences  and  a  review  of                documents deemed relevant for the purpose of rendering their view                (relying as to materiality as to factual  matters on certificates                of officers and other factual representations by the Company, the                MHC and the Bank), nothing has come to their attention that would                lead them to believe that the MHC  Application,  the Registration                Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto                (other than the  financial  statements,  the notes  thereto,  and                other tabular, financial, statistical and appraisal data included                therein as to which no view need be rendered) contained an untrue                statement of a material  fact or omitted to state a material fact                required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements                therein,  in light of the  circumstances  under  which  they were                made, not misleading.\n\n         In giving such opinion, such counsel may rely as to all matters of fact on  certificates  of officers or directors of the Company,  the MHC and the Bank and certificates of public officials. The opinion of Luse Lehman Gorman Pomerenk & Schick  shall be  governed  by the  Legal  Opinion  Accord  (\"Accord\")  of the American  Bar  Association  Section of  Business  Law (1991).  The term  \"Actual Knowledge\"  as used herein  shall have the meaning set forth in the Accord.  For purposes of such opinion, no proceedings shall be deemed to be pending, no order or stop order shall be deemed to be issued,  and no action shall be deemed to be instituted unless, in each case, a director or executive officer of the Company, the MHC or the Bank shall have received a copy of such\n\n                                       27\n\nproceedings,  order,  stop order or action.  In  addition,  such  opinion may be limited to present  statutes,  regulations and judicial  interpretations  and to\n\n\n\n\n\nfacts as they  presently  exist;  in rendering  such opinion,  such counsel need assume no  obligation  to revise or  supplement  it should the  present  laws be changed by legislative or regulatory action, judicial decision or otherwise; and such counsel need express no view, opinion or belief with respect to whether any proposed  or  pending  legislation,  if  enacted,  or any  proposed  or  pending regulations or policy statements issued by any regulatory agency, whether or not promulgated  pursuant to any such legislation,  would affect the validity of the Offering or any aspect  thereof.  Such counsel may assume that any  agreement is the valid and binding obligation of any parties to such agreement other than the Company, the MHC or the Bank.\n\n         The  favorable  opinion,  dated as of the Closing Date and addressed to the  Agent and for their  benefit,  of the  Bank's  local  counsel,  in form and substance to the effect that, to the best of such counsel's  knowledge,  (i) the Company,  the MHC and the Bank have good and marketable  title to all properties and assets which are  material to the  business of the Company,  the MHC and the Bank and to those properties and assets described in the Registration  Statement and  Prospectus,  as owned  by them,  free  and  clear  of all  liens,  charges, encumbrances or  restrictions,  except such as are described in the Registration Statement and Prospectus, or are not material in relation to the business of the Company,  the MHC and the Bank  considered  as one  enterprise;  (ii) all of the leases and  subleases  material to the business of the Company,  the MHC and the Bank under which the Company, the MHC and the Bank hold properties, as described in the Registration Statement and Prospectus,  are in full force and effect; and (iii) the Bank is duly qualified as a foreign  corporation to transact  business and is in good standing in each  jurisdiction in which its ownership of property or  leasing  of  property  or  the  conduct  of  its  business   requires   such qualification,  unless  the  failure to be so  qualified  in one or more of such jurisdictions  would  not  have a  material  adverse  effect  on the  condition, financial or otherwise, or the business, operations or income of the Bank.\n\n          (d)  At the Closing Date,  the Agent shall have received the favorable                opinion,  dated as of the  Closing  Date,  of Silver,  Freedman &                Taff, L.L.P.,  the Agent's counsel,  with respect to such matters                as the Agent may reasonably  require.  Such opinion may rely upon                the opinions of counsel to the Company, the MHC and the Bank, and                as  to  matters  of  fact,  upon  certificates  of  officers  and                directors of the Company, the MHC and the Bank delivered pursuant                hereto or as such counsel shall reasonably request.\n\n          (e)  At the Closing Date, the Agent shall receive a certificate of the                Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Principal  Financial  and/or                Accounting  Officer of the Company,  the MHC and the Bank in form                and substance  reasonably  satisfactory  to the Agent's  Counsel,                dated as of such Closing Date, to the effect that:  (i) they have                carefully  reviewed the Prospectus and, in their opinion,  at the                time  the  Prospectus   became  authorized  for  final  use,  the                Prospectus  did not  contain any untrue  statement  of a material                fact or omit to state a material fact  necessary in order to make                the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which                they were made, not misleading;

 (iv) the  representations  and warranties in Section 4                are true and  correct  with the same  force and  effect as though                expressly  made at and as of the Closing  Date;

An  indemnifying  party  may  participate  at its own                expense in the  defense of such  action.  In  addition,  if it so                elects within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice,  an                indemnifying party,  jointly with any other indemnifying  parties                receiving  such  notice,  may assume  defense of such action with                counsel chosen by it and approved by the indemnified parties that                are defendants in such action,  unless such  indemnified  parties                reasonably object to such assumption on the ground that there may                be legal defenses available to them that are different from or in                addition to those  available to such  indemnifying  party.  If an                indemnifying  party  assumes  the  defense  of such  action,  the                indemnifying  parties  shall  not be  liable  for  any  fees  and                expenses  of  counsel  for  the  indemnified   parties   incurred                thereafter in connection  with such action,  proceeding or claim,                other than reasonable costs\n\n                                       35\n\n               of investigation.  In no event shall the indemnifying  parties be                liable for the fees and expenses of more than one  separate  firm                of attorneys (and any special  counsel that said firm may retain)                for each  indemnified  party in  connection  with any one action,                proceeding  or claim or separate but similar or related  actions,                proceedings or claims in the same jurisdiction arising out of the                same general allegations or circumstances.\n\n          (d)  The  agreements  contained  in this  Section  8 and in  Section 9                hereof and the representations and warranties of the Company, the                MHC  and the  Bank  set  forth  in this  Agreement  shall  remain                operative  and in full  force and effect  regardless  of: (i) any                investigation  made by or on behalf  of agent or their  officers,                directors or controlling persons,  agent or employees or by or on                behalf  of the  Company,  the MHC or the  Bank  or any  officers,                directors  or  controlling  persons,  agent or  employees  of the                Company,  the  MHC or the  Bank;  (ii)  delivery  of and  payment                hereunder  for the  Shares;  or  (iii)  any  termination  of this\n\n\n\n\n\n               Agreement.\n\n         Section 9.  Contribution.  In order to provide  for just and  equitable contribution  in  circumstances  in which the  indemnification  provided  for in Section 8 is due in  accordance  with its terms but is for any reason  held by a court to be unavailable  from the Company,  the MHC, the Bank or the Agent,  the Company,  the MHC,  the Bank and the Agent  shall  contribute  to the  aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including any investigation,  legal and other  expenses  incurred in connection  with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action,  suit or proceeding of any claims asserted,  but after deducting any  contribution  received by the Company,  the MHC, the Bank or the Agent from persons  other  than  the  other  party  thereto,  who may  also be  liable  for contribution)  in such  proportion  so that the  Agent is  responsible  for that portion  represented by the percentage  that the fees paid to the Agent pursuant to  Section 2 of this  Agreement  (not  including  expenses)  bears to the gross proceeds  received by the Company  from the sale of the Shares in the  Offering, and the Company,  the MHC and the Bank shall be responsible for the balance. If, however,  the allocation provided above is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified  party failed to give the notice required under Section 8 above, then each indemnifying  party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified  party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative fault of the Company, the MHC and the Bank on the one hand and the Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses,  claims,  damages or  liabilities  (or actions,  proceedings  or claims in respect  thereto),  but also the  relative  benefits  received  by the Company,  the MHC and the Bank on the one hand and the Agent on the  other  from the Offering (before deducting expenses). The relative fault shall be determined by  reference  to,  among other  things,  whether  the untrue or alleged  untrue statement  of a material  fact or the  omission  or alleged  omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, the MHC and/or the Bank on the one hand or the Agent on the other and the parties' relative intent, good faith,  knowledge,  access to  information  and  opportunity  to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the MHC, the Bank and the Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if  contribution  pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro-rata allocation or by any other\n\n                                       36\n\nmethod  of   allocation   which  does  not  take  into  account  the   equitable considerations  referred to above in this  Section 9. The amount paid or payable by  an  indemnified  party  as a  result  of  the  losses,  claims,  damages  or liabilities (or actions,  proceedings or claims in respect thereof)  referred to above in this  Section 9 shall be deemed to include any legal or other  expenses reasonably  incurred by such indemnified party in connection with  investigating or defending any such action,  proceeding or claim. It is expressly  agreed that the Agent shall not be liable for any loss, liability,  claim, damage or expense or be required  to  contribute  any amount  which in the  aggregate  exceeds the amount paid (excluding reimbursable expenses) to the Agent under this Agreement. It is understood  that the above stated  limitation on the Agent's  liability is essential  to the  Agent and that the Agent  would  not have  entered  into this Agreement  if such  limitation  had not been  agreed to by the  parties  to this Agreement.  No person found guilty of any fraudulent  misrepresentation  (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to  contribution from any person who was not found guilty of such  fraudulent  misrepresentation. The  obligations  of the Company,  the MHC and the Bank under this Section 9 and under Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability  which the Company and the Bank may  otherwise  have.  For purposes of this Section 9, each of the Agent's, the Company's,  the MHC or the Bank's officers and directors and each person, if any,  who  controls  the Agent or the  Company or the MHC or the Bank within the meaning  of the  1933  Act and the  1934 Act  shall  have  the  same  rights  to contribution as the Agent, the Company,  the MHC or the Bank. Any party entitled to contribution, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit,  claim or  proceeding  against  such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party under this Section 9, will notify such party from whom  contribution may be sought,  but the omission to so notify such party shall not relieve the party from whom contribution may be sought from any other  obligation it may have hereunder or otherwise than under this Section 9.\n\n         Section 10. Survival of Agreements,  Representations  and  Indemnities. The respective  indemnities of the Company,  the MHC, the Bank and the Agent and the representations and warranties and other statements of the Company, the MHC, the Bank and the Agent set forth in or made  pursuant  to this  Agreement  shall remain in full force and effect,  regardless of any  termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any  investigation  made by or on behalf of the Agent,  the Company,  the MHC, the Bank or any  controlling  person referred to in Section 8 hereof,  and shall  survive the  issuance of the Shares,  and any  successor  or assign of the Agent,  the Company,  the MHC, the Bank, and any such  controlling person  shall  be  entitled  to  the  benefit  of  the  respective   agreements, indemnities, warranties and representations.\n\n         Section 11.  Termination.  The Agent may  terminate  this  Agreement by giving  the  notice  indicated  below in this  Section 11 at any time after this Agreement becomes effective as follows:\n\n          (a)  In the  event  the  Company  fails to sell the  required  minimum                number of the Shares by _________,  2000, and in accordance  with                the provisions of the Plan or as required by the MHC Regulations,                and applicable law, this Agreement shall terminate upon refund by                the Company to each person who has  subscribed for or ordered any                of the Shares the full amount which it may\n\n\n\n\n\n                                       37\n\n               have  received  from  such  person,  together  with  interest  as                provided in the Prospectus,  and no party to this Agreement shall                have any obligation to the other hereunder, except for payment by                the  Company,  the MHC and/or  the Bank as set forth in  Sections                2(a), 6, 8 and 9 hereof.\n\n          (b)  If any of the  conditions  specified  in Section 7 shall not have                been  fulfilled  when and as  required by this  Agreement  unless                waived in writing, or by the Closing Date, this Agreement and all                of the Agent's  obligations  hereunder  may be  cancelled  by the                Agent  by  notifying  the  Company,  the MHC and the Bank of such                cancellation in writing or by telegram at any time at or prior to                the  Closing  Date,  and any such  cancellation  shall be without                liability  of any party to any other  party  except as  otherwise                provided in Sections 2(a), 6, 8 and 9 hereof.\n\n          (c)  If the Agent  elects to terminate  this  Agreement as provided in                this Section, the Company, the MHC and the Bank shall be notified                promptly by telephone or telegram, confirmed by letter.\n\n         The Company,  the MHC and the Bank may terminate  this Agreement in the event the Agent is in material breach of the  representations  and warranties or covenants  contained  in Section 5 and such  breach has not been cured after the Company,  the MHC and the Bank  have  provided  the  Agent  with  notice of such breach.\n\n         This Agreement may also be terminated by mutual written  consent of the parties hereto.\n\n         Section 12. Notices.  All  communications  hereunder,  except as herein otherwise specifically  provided,  shall be mailed in writing and if sent to the Agent shall be mailed,  delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to Charles Webb & Company,  a Division of Keefe,  Bruyette & Woods,  Inc., 211 Bradenton,  Dublin, Ohio 43017-3514,  Attention: Patricia A.

This option to terminate this Agreement may only be      exercised by providing written notice within ninety (90) days of      Excite@Home's receiving notice of such transaction.

In the event that      Application Provider is unable and/or unwilling to deliver such additions,      or in the event that the parties disagree on the direction of the      Co-Branded Application or its integration, Excite@Home may terminate the      Agreement with no penalty by providing ninety (90) days written notice.      Notwithstanding the foregoing, Excite shall not be entitled to terminate      this Agreement in the event that the requested\n\n                                    17\n\n18 *****Confidential Treatment has been requested for portions of this agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing,           all payments for User Data records shall be due and accrue in           accordance with terms of this Agreement.\n\n  iii) For a period of up to sixty (60) days, Application Provider will           provide consulting services to Excite@Home, as Excite@Home may           reasonably request and for reasonable fees to be paid to Application           Provider, such fees to be agreed upon in writing by the Parties, to           assist Excite@Home in providing a seamless transition to Program           Members. Application Provider will have no obligation to provide such           services to Excite@Home to the extent that Application Provider's           personnel and resources are unavailable in the amounts requested by           Excite@Home or if the Parties are unable in good faith to agree on the           reasonable fees to be paid to Application Provider for such services.           Application Provider will not be required, in the course of providing           such consulting services to Excite@Home, to disclose or transfer to           Excite@Home any proprietary information, software, or Intellectual           Property of Application Provider or any of its merchant partners.\n\n  iv)  To further ensure a seamless transition for Program Members, in the           event of a termination based upon a material breach by e-centives or           an acquisition pursuant to Section 16.a.v. only, Application Provider           shall continue to host and maintain the Co-Branded Application for a           period of one hundred twenty (120) days following either receipt or           issuance of notice of intention to terminate this Agreement.

The content and copy of such emails shall be                mutually agreed upon.\n\n       ii)  The first email will be exclusive to e-centives (i.e., it will                not mention similar services from Excite@Home or other third                parties) and will alert Program Members of the continuation of                the e-centives service directly from e-centives. Program Members                shall be further alerted that their membership in the e-centives                service shall continue unless they explicitly opt-out.                Excite@Home shall not promote competing services in such contact                or otherwise discourage Program Members from continuing to use                the e-centives service as provided directly by e-centives.\n\n       iii) The second email will not be exclusive to e-centives. It will                include the same e-centives alerts as in the first email, but may                offer a replacement Excite@Home service and a notification that                the Program Member will remain in such an Excite@Home-provided                service unless they specifically opt-out. Excite@Home shall not                discourage Program Members from continuing to use the e-centives                service directly from e-centives, but may offer an additional                choice. It is conceivable that any one end user customer could                use both services.\n\n       iv)  Any such communications will be subject to Excite@Home's                then-current privacy policy.\n\n  b)   In the event that the Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section           16.a.v. due to e-centives' acquisition by an Excite@Home Named           Competitor, or by an entity controlling or controlled by an           Excite@Home Named Competitor, e-centives or its assigns or designates           may not contact any Users for whom User Data has been provided           pursuant to this Agreement, excluding those that have opted out in           accordance with Section 5(a) of Exhibit D. In the event of such           termination, e-centives will not be eligible for any refund of           pre-termination payments made to Excite@Home.\n\n                                    19\n\n20 *****Confidential Treatment has been requested for portions of this agreement.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n  a)   The parties agree that any breach of either of the parties'           obligations regarding trademarks, service marks or trade names and/or           confidentiality would result in irreparable injury for which there is           no adequate remedy at law. Therefore, in the event of any breach or           threatened breach of a party's obligations regarding trademarks,           service marks or trade names or confidentiality, the aggrieved party           will be entitled to seek equitable relief in addition to its other           available legal remedies in a court of competent jurisdiction.

Any attempt         to assign this Agreement other than as permitted above will be null and         void.\n\n  c) Notice. Any notice under this Agreement will be in writing and delivered         by personal delivery, express courier, confirmed facsimile, confirmed         email or certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and         will be deemed given upon personal delivery, one (1) day after deposit         with express courier, upon confirmation of receipt of facsimile or email         or five (5) days after deposit in the mail.

The parties are independent contractors and will have no         power or authority to assume or create any obligation or responsibility         on behalf of each other. This Agreement will not be construed to create         or imply any partnership, agency or joint venture.\n\n  e) Audit Rights.

In the case of inaccurate and/or outdated      User Data, the providing party shall immediately provide accurate User Data      and/or updated User Data (to the extent such party has updated User Data.\n\nf)   Force Majeure.  Any delay in or failure of performance by either party      under this Agreement will not be considered a breach of this Agreement and      will be excused to the extent caused by any occurrence beyond the      reasonable control of such party including, but not limited to, acts of      God, power outages and governmental restrictions.\n\ng)   Severability.

This Agreement is the complete and exclusive agreement      between the parties with respect to the subject matter or related matters      hereof, superseding any prior agreements and communications (both written      and oral) regarding such subject matter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the      Sponsorship Agreement effective on March 5, 1999 that currently is in      force between the two parties to this Agreement shall remain in force, on      an interim basis only, and will terminate at the end of the calendar month      that the Co-Branded Application launches on the Excite@Home Shopping      service without further compensation from either party.\n\ni)   Waiver.  The failure of either Party to require performance by the other      Party of any provision of this Agreement will not affect the full right to      require such performance at any time thereafter; nor will the waiver by      either Party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement be taken or      held to be a waiver of the provision itself.\n\nj)   Modification.

The                remaining 70% of such first pages, along with subsequent pages                within each category, the offer placement locations will be                split 50%/50% between Excite@Home and e-centives and will be                served in an alternating order.\n\n  b)   For the second and any following pages presented within any shopping           category area, half of the offer placement positions will be           allocated to Excite@Home and the other half will be allocated to           e-centives and the position of said placements on the page shall be           random.\n\n                                    30\n\n31 *****Confidential Treatment has been requested for portions of this agreement.

For any branding at the merchant subject to           final merchant approval, e-centives shall use commercially reasonable           efforts to ensure that both Excite@Home and e-centives branding           elements are present.\n\n  c)   Both traditional e-centives offers and Excite@Home e-centives offers           will contain e-centives branding elements within an application that           is otherwise Excite@Home branded.\n\n  d)   The Co-Branded Application shall conform to Excite@Home Third-Party           Application standards, including:\n\n       i)   Page weight;\n\n       ii)  Presence of advertising banners and/or sponsorship placements                served by Excite@Home/MatchLogic at Excite@Home's exclusive                option;\n\n       iii) Color, fonts, layout, design standards, header, footer,                navigational elements, tabbing metaphors, etc.;\n\n       iv)  Navigational elements directing traffic to non-e-centives content                (e.g., Excite@Home Mail and other Excite@Home Shopping                destinations);\n\n       v)   Excite@Home's Third-Party Application Standards may change over                the Term of this Agreement.

Any such required changes shall be reasonable                and shall be materially similar to changes required of other                applications and application providers subject to Excite@Home's                Third-Party Application Standards.\n\n  e)   The Co-Branded Application shall be designed to appear to the customer           as being Excite@Home; analogs to the goal would be Excite@Home's           sports content area at http://www.excite.com/sports, as it appears on           the Effective Date of this Agreement (see Exhibit C), which is served           by a third-party firm but carries only Excite@Home messaging cues.\n\n                                    31\n\n32 *****Confidential Treatment has been requested for portions of this agreement.

OFFER HIERARCHY SYNCHRONIZATION\n\n  a)   e-centives does not need to adopt Excite@Home's directory structure           but must use similar categorization methodology. For example, Autos           and Electronics may be categories at the same level in the hierarchy,           but Autos and Cameras would not be at the same level.\n\n  b)   e-centives must map to Excite@Home's Shopping directory hierarchy,           which may change from time to time during the Term of this Agreement.\n\n  c)   e-centives must adopt Excite@Home's naming conventions (e.g.           Excite@Home's \"Autos\" label vs. e-centives' \"Automotive\" label).\n\n  d)   e-centives must provide product and/or offer search capabilities that           are comparable to Excite Network offerings, including local (zip           code) and off-line redemption.

If Excite@Home does not sell such emails, or           all positions within such emails, then e-centives may do so.\n\n  c)   Excite@Home and e-centives shall share equally all net revenue from           such offers, defined as gross revenue minus third-party serving           costs, which shall not exceed $0.01 per email piece delivered.\n\n4.

Each party           shall assume its own costs in both sending outbound email and in           providing necessary reporting and data to the other party.\n\n5.

OFFERS\n\n a)  The parties will work together to develop mutually agreed upon modules         designed to promote the Co-Branded Application, which may appear on the         Excite.com homepage for some Users.\n\n b)  At its discretion, Excite@Home may include up to five rotating links on         the My Excite Start Page (\"MESP\"). At Excite@Home's discretion,         Excite@Home may include Excite@Home exclusive e-centives offers, non-         exclusive e-centives offers may also get rotation on MESP, or general         calls to action to the Co-Branded Application.\n\n c)  At Excite@Home's discretion, links may be included in the \"My Services\"         module. All decisions regarding this module remain Excite@Home's,         including but not limited to the name and relative placement of the         module on MESP.

OFFER CATEGORIES\n\n a)  This Section applies to the publicly accessible narrowband offering from         Excite@Home, currently available at http://www.excite.com.\n\n b)  Excite@Home intends to use a randomization function to surface offers on         MESP in order to provide category specification by user and to support         dynamic content delivery for each server-refreshed page view. This         technique will support all e-centives categories and personalized user         category filtering, but will not support offers that can appear in         multiple categories or offer weighting.\n\n c)  Of all e-centives implementation links on MESP, any single category can         have only one link placement.\n\n d)  For a category to be surfaced, there must be three unique offers in that         category. The minimum of three offers per category must remain fresh;         if more than one week has elapsed without new offers being available         then a status message indicating no new offers in the category selected         will appear.\n\n e)  To prevent multiple appearances of a single offer on one MESP page view,         every offer must be tagged to only one e-centives category.\n\n                                    37    38 *****Confidential Treatment has been requested for portions of this agreement.

The receiving party will, at the request of the disclosing party, during the term of this Agreement or thereafter (i) promptly return all Confidential Information and Trade Secrets held or used by the receiving party in whatever form, or (ii) at the discretion of the disclosing party, promptly destroy all such Confidential Information and Trade Secrets, including all copies thereof, and those portions of all documents that incorporate such Confidential Information and/or Trade Secrets.\n\n7.

No waiver by either party hereto of any breach or default by the other party shall be construed to be a waiver of any other breach or default by such other party. Resort to any remedies referred to herein shall not be construed as a waiver of any other rights and remedies to which either party is entitled under this Agreement or otherwise nor shall an election to terminate be deemed an election of remedies or a waiver of any claim for damages or otherwise.\n\n(f) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed original, but all of which will constitute one and the same instrument.\n\n(g) Complete Agreement.

Such notifying Party must also provide notice of the date of termination  of such Force Majeure event. A Force Majeure event affecting the performance by either Party shall not relieve it of liability in the event of its  negligence, where such negligence was a cause of the Force Majeure event, or in the event of its failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to  remedy the situation and remove the cause with all reasonable dispatch.\n\n7.2 Strikes.\n\n     It is understood and agreed that the settlement of strikes or lockouts is entirely within the discretion of the Party directly involved in the strike  or lockout, and that the above requirement that any Force Majeure must be remedied with all reasonable dispatch will not require the settlement of  strikes or lockouts by acceding to the demands of the opposing party when such course is inadvisable in the discretion of the Party having the  difficulty.\n\nARTICLE VIII  INSURANCE AND INDEMNIFICATION\n\n8.1 Operator Insurance.\n\n     8.1.1 Operator, with respect to Operator's activities provided for under this Agreement, shall maintain the following insurance coverage with  responsible insurance carriers and/or through a program of self-insurance:\n\n18\n\n  (a)   Workers' Compensation.

These policies shall  provide primary coverage for claims in which Operator has agreed to hold harmless and/or to indemnify the Owner Indemnified Parties. No  \"other insurance\" clause may be invoked by any insurer. This coverage shall apply whether or not the indemnification is valid. Operator shall  have its insurer(s) waive its right of subrogation against Owner Indemnified Parties on all insurance carried.

Charity Tunes shall make its music catalogue available to the purchasers in MP3 file format to the fullest extent that such  format is available to Charity Tunes pursuant to any agreements in effect between Charity Tunes and its wholesalers on the  date of this Agreement. Accordingly, Charity Tunes shall use its best efforts to update its music catalogue with available MP3  files by June 30, 2009.    The custom interactive landing page shall be designed, operated and maintained at the expense of Sponsor, and shall be  subject to the mutual approval by Charity Tunes and Sponsor, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The landing  page shall feature the Charity Tunes logo in a size and prominence substantially equal to that of Sponsor.\n\nPOGO 8 pack, POGO 10 pack, POGO 20 pack and POGO 30 pack products sold at participating retail locations in Canada  (individually and collectively the \"Designated Sponsor Products\") are the only products for which a Pin Code will be  distributed and each consumer who purchases a Designated Sponsor Product will receive one and only one Pin Code while  supplies last and subject to the limitations detailed herein.

No 3- song, 5-song, or 7-song Pin Codes may be subdivided, duplicated or distributed in combination with one another.    Charity Tunes agrees to generate the unique Pin Codes for the Promotion.

The fees will typically appear on the end user's Wireless Platform bill and be remitted by the end user to the CSP pursuant to an agreement between the end user and the CSP. The CSP will in turn remit fees to Licensee (less any Deductions as that term is defined in Paragraph 7(a)(ii) below) pursuant to an agreement between Licensee and the CSP.

Furthermore, notwithstanding use of the terms \"sale\" and \"sell\" throughout this Agreement, any distribution or delivery of the Wireless Products by Licensee to any sublicensee (including, without limitation, CSPs and end-users) will be by license and not by sale (and Licensee shall post notice of that fact in sufficient size, location and manner on Licensee's website on the page from which the general public can subscribe to the Wireless Products). Accordingly, Licensee acknowledges that the \"First Sale Doctrine\" (as embodied in 17 U.S.C., Paragraph 109 of the United States Copyright Act of 1976, as amended, or the equivalent law or statute in the Territory) does not apply to Licensee's acquisition of rights in and to the PSM and the Property hereunder or to any sublicensee's acquisition of rights in and to the Wireless Products under any agreement between Licensee and a sublicensee.\n\n12.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that either party (A) fails to pay Royalties or other amounts when due, or (B) fails to make Royalty or other accountings in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, then the breaching party shall be subject to a one-time cure period of fifteen (15) days for such breach. If a party fails to cure the breach within such fifteen (15)-day period or another breach of either (A) or (B) above occurs following an initial cure within the fifteen (15)-day period, then the other party shall have the right in its sole discretion to terminate this Agreement forthwith on written notice without any cure period.\n\n      (vii) Other Agreements: Should any event of default by Licensee cause Fox to terminate this Agreement, Fox, in its sole discretion, may terminate, without any cure period, any other agreements concurrently existing between Fox and Licensee upon written notice specifying the agreements to be terminated.

Licensee agrees that its failure to stop in all respects the sale and/or distribution of the Wireless Products upon termination or expiration of the Agreement will result in immediate irreparable damage to Fox for which there is no adequate remedy at law, and in the event of such failure by Licensee, Fox shall be entitled to injunctive relief. Fox's exercise of any of the foregoing remedies shall not operate as a waiver of any other rights or remedies which Fox may have. Fox shall not distribute the Wireless Products after the termination or expiration of this Agreement without obtaining from Licensee a separate license to the Licensee Materials.\n\n(i) Sell-Off Period: Notwithstanding Paragraph 15(b), in the event of termination of this Agreement, Licensee shall have a period of ***** from the date of such termination (unless such termination occurs less than ***** prior to the expiration of this Agreement in which case the time period shall be shortened accordingly so as not to exceed the date of expiration) in which to sell-off existing inventory of Wireless Products already in the Distribution Channels (\"Sell Off Period\"). Licensee agrees that no additional Wireless Products may be developed or distributed during the Sell Off Period and Licensee agrees to require that any Licensed CSP to comply with this provision. Upon the expiration of the Sell Off Period, Licensee agrees to destroy all such remaining inventory and confirm same in writing to Fox (and require that any Licensed CSP do the same). Any revenues, credits or other consideration received by Licensee for the Wireless Products during the Sell Off Period will be subject to Licensee's obligation to pay Fox Royalties pursuant to Paragraph 7 above.\n\n(ii) Fox's Development of Wireless Products: In the event of termination or expiration of this Agreement or Licensee's loss of exclusive rights under this Agreement, Fox shall be free to create and exploit, or have a third party create or exploit, wireless products which may be similar to those developed and distributed by Licensee pursuant to this Agreement for the Properties.\n\n    (c) Guarantee Forfeiture: In the event of termination of this Agreement and without limitation of Fox's rights and remedies all of which are expressly reserved, the following payment penalties shall apply: (i) if termination occurs in the first year of the Term, Licensee shall forfeit any Guarantee paid, and shall immediately pay any remaining Guarantee, up to the amount of ***** dollars (US$*****), and any Guarantee payments made in excess of ***** dollars ($*****) shall be refunded by Fox to Licensee; and (ii) if termination occurs in the second year of the Term, Licensee shall forfeit any Guarantee paid, and shall immediately pay any remaining portion of the Guarantee then unpaid, up to the amount of ***** dollars (US$*****). Any forfeited Guarantees will apply as a set off against any additional damages claimed by Fox.\n\n16.

The businesses of News America and its subsidiary, Fox Entertainment Group, Inc., include: the production and distribution of motion pictures, television programming and related consumer products (Twentieth Century Fox); television and cable broadcasting (the Fox Network, Fox owned television stations, Fox Sports Net, Fox Sports World, Fox Sports World Espa\u0148ol, Speedvision, Fox News Channel, FX and Fox Movie Channel); the publication of newspapers, books, magazines and promotional free-standing inserts (The New York Post, HarperCollins Publishers, The Weekly Standard and News America Marketing); sports franchises (the Los Angeles Dodgers); and marketing services (SmartSource/iGroup). In this Statement of Privacy Principles these businesses are collectively called the News America Group. At the News America Group we strive to enhance our relationship with consumers. Collecting personal information about consumers is vital to this effort. This Statement of Privacy Principles describes the policies and procedures of the News America Group's U.S.-based businesses for the collection, use, and dissemination of personally identifiable information about U.S. consumers in both the online and offline world. The Principles are based on the concepts of consumer notice and choice.* The News America Group is actively involved in the ongoing privacy debate and is continually monitoring privacy developments. Accordingly, from time to time we may modify these Privacy Principles to reflect changes in the law, self-regulatory initiatives and technology.\n\nCOLLECTION\n\nThe News America Group obtains personally identifiable information only if we believe the information is relevant to our relationship with a consumer or to assist us in creating a relationship with a consumer. We obtain personally identifiable information about consumers directly from consumers whenever possible, primarily in the course of providing them with products, information and services. When the News America Group obtains personally identifiable information from third-party sources, we use only reputable sources. In those instances where our information collection activities involve children, the News America Group provides special privacy protections.\n\nNOTICE\n\nWhen The News America Group collects personally identifiable information from consumers, we inform them about who is collecting the information, why it is being collected, how it is being collected, the types of uses we will make of the information, whether we will disclose the information to third parties and the types of third parties to whom we will disclose the information, and consumers' options regarding the use of their information.\n\nWireless Content License Agreement Multiple Properties / Sorrent, Inc. / Final PLZ\n\n-45-\n\nSource: GLU MOBILE INC, S-1/A, 3/19/2007\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHOICE\n\nThe News America Group provides consumers with an opportunity to choose whether the business unit that collects their personally identifiable information may use it for purposes that are other than those for which the information was submitted, and whether the information may be shared with third parties.\n\nUSE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nInside the News America Group, we use personally identifiable information only in a manner consistent with these Privacy Principles. Personally identifiable information is available only to our employees, agents and contractors who have a business reason to have access to such information. The News America Group uses personally identifiable information to respond to our customers and to make decisions about the goods and services that the News America Group or its business partners provide or hope to provide to consumers. Subject to the exercise of consumer choice, personally identifiable information may be used for different purposes, or shared with our business partners. A News America Group business entity may disclose personally identifiable information without providing consumers with a choice in order to protect the rights of the companies within the News America Group or their respective employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to web sites operated by News America Group companies; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if a News America Group entity sells all or part of one of its businesses, makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a business merger or transfer, personally identifiable information may be transferred to a third party as part of that transaction.\n\nSECURITY\n\nThe News America Group uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel, and physical measures to safeguard personally identifiable information in its possession against loss, theft, and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification.\n\nACCESS, CORRECTION AND DELETION\n\nWhenever possible, each News America Group business unit permits consumers to have a right to see the personally identifiable information that it has collected from them, to correct any information that is incorrect and to instruct the business unit to delete the information from its files.\n\nREMEDIES\n\nConsumers may contact a privacy officer at each News America Group business unit regarding privacy complaints and disputes.\n\nCOMPLIANCE\n\nEach News America Group company will take appropriate measures to ensure compliance with these Privacy Principles.\n\nWireless Content License Agreement Multiple Properties / Sorrent, Inc. / Final PLZ\n\n-46-\n\nSource: GLU MOBILE INC, S-1/A, 3/19/2007\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXHIBIT Q\n\nLICENSEE COMPETITORS\n\nJamdat Mforma Digital Bridges Digital Chocolate Game Loft Infospace\n\nAny further additions and/or deletions shall be mutually agreed and addressed via amendment to this Agreement.\n\nWireless Content License Agreement Multiple Properties / Sorrent, Inc. / Final PLZ\n\n-47-\n\nSource: GLU MOBILE INC, S-1/A, 3/19/2007"}]}, {"title": "HfEnterprisesInc_20191223_S-1_EX-10.22_11931299_EX-10.22_Development Agreement", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "OUTSOURCE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT", "answer_start": 16}], "id": "HfEnterprisesInc_20191223_S-1_EX-10.22_11931299_EX-10.22_Development Agreement__Document Name", "question": "The name of the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "Developer", "answer_start": 448}, {"text": "HotApp International Ltd.", "answer_start": 354}, {"text": "DSS", "answer_start": 343}, {"text": "Document Security Systems, Inc.", "answer_start": 231}], "id": "HfEnterprisesInc_20191223_S-1_EX-10.22_11931299_EX-10.22_Development Agreement__Parties", "question": "The two or more parties who signed the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "1s t day of March, 2018", "answer_start": 169}], "id": "HfEnterprisesInc_20191223_S-1_EX-10.22_11931299_EX-10.22_Development Agreement__Agreement Date", "question": "The date of the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "1s t day of March, 2018", "answer_start": 169}], "id": "HfEnterprisesInc_20191223_S-1_EX-10.22_11931299_EX-10.22_Development Agreement__Effective Date", "question": "The date when the contract is effective\u00a0", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date, and shall continue thereafter for a period of twelve (12) months (the \"Initial Term\").", "answer_start": 2324}], "id": "HfEnterprisesInc_20191223_S-1_EX-10.22_11931299_EX-10.22_Development Agreement__Expiration Date", "question": "On what date will the contract's initial term expire?", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "The Initial Term shall automatically renew for one-month periods thereafter unless either party provides 30- days advance notice of termination, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof", "answer_start": 2484}], "id": "HfEnterprisesInc_20191223_S-1_EX-10.22_11931299_EX-10.22_Development Agreement__Renewal Term", "question": "What is the renewal term after the initial term expires?

OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES   \u25cfInitiate a multi tiered marketing approach, by mutual consent of both parties, to integrate the iMedicor HIPAA Compliant transport network as a communications network throughout the USA MCO user base, \u25cfThe overall project would also include the ClearLobby pharmaceutical and medical device marketing platform and other value added services as mutually agreed into the future, as a Phase II activity. \u25cfA phased in approach for each of the components listed above with the first being the introduction of the core iMedicor, HIPAA compliant communication / transport system into the USA MCO network.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \u25cfThe integrated service will generate revenue sharing opportunities for both companies. \u25cfUSA MCO will allow access to their network to distribute promotional and educational material highlighting the value proposition of the iMedicor / USA MCO alliance. \u25cfAccess will only be through, and controlled by USA MCO \u25cfCommunication will be, but not limited to e-mail promotion, direct mail, bill stuffers, web site, newsletter or any other normal communication between USA MCO and their network of physicians and other healthcare providers upon mutual consent of both parties \u25cfAll material must be approved by USA MCO prior to any distribution to the USA MCO network. \u25cfOnce a physician or other healthcare provider enrolls in iMedicor they will become part of the regular internal iMedicor communications system. \u25cfEvery physician that enrolls in iMedicor, including those physicians or other qualified registrants into the iMedicor network that are invited into USA MCO physician communities, through the efforts of USA MCO will be tagged as originating from that source (the USA MCO network). \u25cfMonthly reports detailing revenue generated through subscriptions, ClearLobby or other methods will be detailed in the monthly reports. \u25cfAll revenue sharing will be reconciled monthly and funds distributed by the 20th of each month by wire transfer for all net collected revenues for the previous month (net of returns and refunds, if any). \u25cfIMedicor will make its records available for audit purposes at any time by USA MCO during regular business hours at the headquarters of iMedicor. \u25cfUSA MCO will not be responsible for any direct sales of the iMedicor communications system; USA MCO will not handle any customer service issues. All such activity will be referred to iMedicor. \u25cfInitially iMedicor will provide the three main attributes of the iMedicor network to the USA MCO provider base, physicians and other healthcare providers. \u25cfThose attributes are:   oA HIPAA compliant transport system for digital / electronic records and images,   oBuild and create community, patient-specific peer collaboration and expansion of referral networks,   oAccess to educational resources, certified, skill level and product / device specific. \u25cf\n\n2. COMPENSATION   \u25cfIMedicor will charge a subscription fee to participating USA MCO providers. The suggested monthly subscription would be $19.95 per month per subscriber. USA MCO would receive one third of the monthly subscription price, per month, per subscriber (approximately $6.65). All revenue sharing opportunities will be calculated for all parties after any credit card or other third party processing fees are deducted from the gross sale. \u25cfUSA MCO will be responsible for the marketing and initial / ongoing communication to their network highlighting the features of iMedicor, the value proposition, and their support of the project. This will not be a direct sales requirement for USA MCO, but only an agreement to provide access to the USA MCO user base \u25cfWithin 30 days of the execution of this agreement both companies agree to finalize a marketing plan that would detail they promotional activity to the USA MCO network, promotional deliverables, frequency of communication with the USA MCO network and other activities normally found in a strategic marketing plan \u25cfBoth companies agree to publish a press release, upon mutual agreement of content, in regard to the execution of this agreement and periodic updates of the success of this Strategic Alliance \u25cfIt is understood that iMedicor is a public company and is obligated to make certain SEC required filings that from time to time will include mention of the Strategic Alliance between iMedicor and USA MCO \u25cfIMedicor shall provide access to the iMedicor system, training and customer support as required. \u25cfUSA MCO will have the option to take all or part of its revenue share in equity up to a maximum of 4.9% ownership in iMedicor on a fully diluted basis. For the purposes of this proposal, fully diluted means all issued and outstanding stock warrants priced at 15 times the average 5 day closing price at the day previous to reconciliation of revenues, which will be the 20th of the month for the prior calendar month.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \u25cfThe iMedicor bookkeeping system will detail the payment option prior to releasing any funds or commitment of stock in order for USA MCO to determine how payment is to be reconciled. It is anticipated that said report will be available by the 15th of the month for previous activity, returned to iMedicor by the 19th in order to effect a timely disbursement of funds and or stock \u25cfIt is understood that the issuance of stock certificates can take up to four weeks but the issue date will be the 20th of the month of reconcile. \u25cfEquity payout will be priced at the average 10 day trading day closing from the day previous to the monthly reconciliation. \u25cfIMedicor will provide a warrant to purchase 2 million shares of common stock to USA MCO to offset any up-front marketing expense incurred by USA MCO in this project. The value of the Warrants will be determined by the average 10 day closing price of iMedicor stock eliminating the two lowest days and the two highest days for the period as of the day before the actual execution of the final agreement. \u25cfThe Warrants will be issued as a non-cash-transaction upon exercise of the Warrant, and, USA MCO will have up to five years from the date of issuance to exe4cute. USA MCO will also have the option to purchase the Warrant for the face value if it deemed the purchase option to be more favorable to the cashless transaction. \u25cfIn addition to the subscription fees, iMedicor would offer a 17% revenue share (cash payout only) through revenues generated with its ClearLobby program. Clearlobby represents the Pharma / Medical Device marketing division inside iMedicor that will expose physicians and other providers within the USA MCO provider network to new products and services in a non-invasive, opt-in manner. ClearLobby will be the Phase II part of the relationship. \u25cfiMedicor will inform USA MCO of all ClearLobby activity as new products and services are introduced into the system \u25cfIMedicor will, from time to time make available upgrade services to its members. In this event, USA MCO will receive a revenue share to be determined on a case by case basis.   3.

Recipient hereby also agrees that it will use the Confidential Information disclosed by Recipient for informational purposes only. Recipient hereby further agrees that it shall not use the Confidential Information of Recipient in the production and/or the providing of any products and/or services now or in anytime in the future.\n\nE. Recipient agrees that it shall treat all Confidential Information of Recipient with the same degree of care as it accords to its own Confidential Information, and Recipient represents that it exercises reasonable care to protect its own Confidential Information.\n\nF.

In the event of a breach or a threatened breach of any of the Provisions and/or Covenants set forth in this Section 9 of the Agreement above (the ''Covenants''), Discloser will, in addition to the remedies provided by law, have:   (a) the right and remedy to have the Covenants specifically enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that any material breach of any of the Covenants will cause irreparable injury to Discloser and that money damages will not provide an adequate remedy to Discloser; and\n\n(b) the right and remedy to require a person to account for and pay over to Discloser all compensation, profits, moneys, accruals, increments or other benefits (collectively the ''Benefits'') derived or received by Recipient as a result of any transactions constituting a breach of any of the Covenants, and Recipient hereby agrees to account for and pay over the Benefits to Discloser.\n\nJ. The obligations of the parties set forth in this paragraph 9 of this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    10.

FORCE MAJEURE   Neither party will be liable for, or will be considered to be in breach of or default under this Agreement on account of, any delay or failure to perform as required by this Agreement as a result of any causes or conditions that are beyond such Party's reasonable control and that such Party is unable to overcome through the exercise of commercially reasonable diligence.

The University and/or Principal Investigator together with ArTara and the CRO will conduct the Project in accordance with the Project Plan and will use all reasonable endeavors consistent with their expertise to successfully complete the Project. It is the goal of the Project to use the Program Data as clinical support for Product Regulatory Filings and to gain approval to commercialize the Product for the Indication in the Territory. 2.2 Project Plan. The Project Plan as approved by each of the Parties may be modified or amended only upon mutual agreement of each of the Parties. The Project will consist of three phases: (a) Phase I: University and/or Principal Investigator will provide access to the Program Data to ArTara and the CRO at the University's facilities. ArTara and the CRO will be allowed to make complete copies of the original Program Data for the purposes of off-site data entry and storage, all as and only to the extent needed to support ArTara's efforts to accomplish the Project. University will provide ArTara and CRO the opportunity to examine the originals of medical records and supporting records for the Program Data at the University during normal business hours and at mutually agreeable times. University and Principal Investigator will also provide to ArTara contact information for other participating investigators and research sites that have contributed data to the Program. University will retain all Program Data for the sooner to occur of a New Drug Application (NDA) for the Product being approved or ten (10) years from the Effective Date. ArTara will bear any costs related to necessary long-term on or off-site storage of the Program Data, medical records and/or supporting records. ArTara understands that separate engagement agreements may be required by collaborating third party entities and associated principal investigators and University will assist ArTara in obtaining such agreements. It is understood that the goal of Phase I is a feasibility analysis of the Program Data to support Regulatory Filings in the United States. (b) Phase II: University recognizes that because of ArTara's unfamiliarity with the Program Data database, assistance from the Principal Investigator and other research and medical employees of the University may from time to time be needed for ArTara to query and analyze the Program Data database as needed to achieve successful presentation to applicable Regulatory Authorities and submission of Regulatory Filings. ArTara will endeavor to minimize University resources required during Phase II. The goal of Phase II will be to compile the Project Documentation. (c) Phase III: CRO will convert Program Data to eCTD format for submission to Regulatory Authorities. University recognizes that ArTara may receive specific data requests from Regulatory Authorities in connection with ArTara's presentations of Program Data to support Regulatory Filings. University will assist ArTara in responding to such requests for data or access to source data from Regulatory Authorities. ArTara agrees to notify University of such requests as soon as is practicable. The goal of Phase III will be filing of a BLA based on Project Documentation and response to Regulatory Authorities.\n\n4\n\nSource: ARTARA THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 1/10/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Phase IV Optional: Upon mutual written agreement of University and ArTara, ArTara may sponsor, and University may conduct, new Product or Product-related clinical studies (for example, follow-up studies) to support the goal of the Project or as may be useful for gaining or maintaining Regulatory Approvals for the Product for the Indication. Any such studies will be at the sole discretion of each Party subject to terms and conditions to be mutually agreed upon in agreements separate from this Agreement. Richard Smith, MD will be given first consideration as a principal investigator for all new Product or Product- related clinical studies, in addition to other sites provided final site selection will be based on the best interest of the Project.

If Eurofarma has not made the first commercial sale within twelve (12) months after receipt of the MA in a Lead Country of the Territory, not for reasons outside of its control, or if Eurofarma has failed to use reasonable commercial efforts to meet the annual objectives of the most updated Business Plan during the Term, which may be amended by Eurofarma from time to time and accepted by NLS, then NLS may, upon sixty (60) days prior written notice to Eurofarma (unless Eurofarma makes such first commercial sale within such sixty-day period), terminate the rights granted to Eurofarma with respect to the Licensed Product in such country. 19.6. Early Termination by the Licensee i) Eurofarma may terminate the Agreement upon ninety (90) days prior written notice to NLS in case the US Supplemental Data to support the Dossier for Brazil is not or cannot be provided by NLS within the time limit agreed by the Parties or cannot be generated as part of the Local Supplemental Data for Brazil. ii) Eurofarma may terminate the Agreement in case the activities conducted by NLS under article 5, paragraphs a), b) and c) do not allow the Licensed Product to be approved by the US FDA. iii) Eurofarma may terminate the Agreement in case the Licensed Product fails to receive a MA from the US FDA or a MA is not granted on the Licensed Product in any of the Lead Countries despite reasonable commercial efforts by Eurofarma to seek and obtain such MA. iv). Eurofarma shall have the right to terminate the Agreement in case of fundamental changes in the market, competitive and economic conditions, outside of the Parties control, at the time of the launch of the Licensed Product in the territory which would make its commercialization not economically viable and provided that the Parties after good faith efforts fail to agree on an alternative plan to address this situation within 3 months following the notification by Eurofarma to NLS of its decision to terminate the Agreement under this clause.\n\n19\n\nSource: NLS PHARMACEUTICS LTD., F-1, 2/28/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nLicense and Development Agreement\n\n19.7.

(iii) Promptly upon the request of Licensor, the Licensee shall, at the Licensor's sole discretion and election for each country of the Territory and each Licensed Product either withdraw or transfer all Marketing Authorizations in the Territory to the Licensor (or to a third party as the Licensor directs). Licensee shall take the required steps without any delay and the withdrawal or transfer shall be completed in maximum 90 days after the notification of the request; if the Licensor does not decide and inform within this period to whom the Marketing Authorizations and documents shall be transferred, then the Licensee shall have no obligation to keep them active.

No Assignment This Agreement may not be assigned or otherwise transferred, nor may any right or obligations hereunder be assigned or transferred, by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party; provided, however, that Licensor may, without such consent, assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, to an Affiliate or in connection with the transfer or sale of all or substantially all of its assets related to the Licensed Product or the business relating thereto, or in the event of its merger or consolidation or change in control or similar transaction.

The copy filed herewith omits the information subject to the confidentiality request. Omissions are marked by brackets with asterisks, such as [***]. A complete version of this Exhibit has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nSTRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT   THIS STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT  (\"Agreement\"), entered into as of October 22, 2010 (the \"Effective Date\") by and between PPD Development, LP, a Texas limited partnership, with its principal executive offices located at 929 North Front Street, Wilmington, North Carolina 28401 (\"PPD\") and VirtualScopics, Inc., with an address of 500 Linden Oaks, Second Floor, Rochester, New York 14625 (\"VS\").   WHEREAS, PPD is a clinical research organization engaged in the business of managing clinical research programs and providing services regarding the development of pharmaceuticals, chemicals, biotechnology and other products through clinical testing;   WHEREAS, VS is in the business of providing imaging services to the medical, pharmaceutical and related industries;   WHEREAS, PPD and VS desire to enter into a mutually beneficial relationship with a mission to deliver a comprehensive set of clinical and medical imaging services that will enable biopharmaceutical companies to make faster, more confident decisions on the development of their compounds, creating time and cost efficiencies; and   WHEREAS, the parties desire to develop, market, sell, and deliver those joint service offerings pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth herein.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:   1. Term. The term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and shall continue for a period of two (2) years (\"Initial Term\") unless terminated earlier in accordance with Section 11 of this Agreement. Upon expiration of the Initial Term, unless written notice to the contrary is provided by one party to the other party at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the then-current term, this Agreement shall be renewed for additional, successive periods of one (1) year each (each a \"Renewal\" and together with the Initial Term, collectively, the \"Term\").  In connection with any Renewal, the parties shall mutually agree upon and set forth in a written amendment signed by the parties (i) any changes to the Services constituting Preferred Services and (ii) any changes to the [***], VS Preferred Pricing, percentage Discount (defined in Section 4 below) or Bookings thresholds for all such Preferred Services. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, all active Work Orders issued prior to such expiration or termination shall remain subject to the terms and conditions contained herein so long as such Work Order remains active.   2. Services. PPD or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates may engage VS to perform imaging services (the \"Services\") for a specific sponsor's clinical research study (\"Sponsor\") or for a particular project. The Services may be amended, supplemented, or replaced from time to time upon mutual agreement of VS and PPD.\n\n[***] Represents material which has been redacted and filed separately with the Commission pursuant to a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Services Commitment. \"Preferred Services\" shall be defined as those imaging services included within the service offerings of VS at the time of final execution of this Agreement which are specifically provided by VS in the therapeutic areas of hematology and oncology (\"Designated Therapeutic Areas\") to the extent such imaging services are subject to the commitments of VS set forth in this Section 3 (the \"Commitments\"). \"PPD Services\" shall be defined as clinical research organization services regarding the management of clinical trials for the development of pharmaceuticals, chemicals, biotechnology and other products through clinical testing. Preferred Services and PPD Services shall be subject to all of the rights and obligations otherwise set forth in this Agreement. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to limit the provision of non-Preferred Services hereunder, however, such non-Preferred Services shall not be subject to the Commitments set forth in this Section 3.   a. Joint Commitments   (i) The parties acknowledge and agree that it is their intent and commitment to expand the Joint Solution (as defined below) to therapeutic areas beyond the Designated Therapeutic Areas. Upon mutual agreement regarding such expansion, it is the parties' further intent to make such additional Joint Solution services subject to substantially the same commitments as those set forth herein.   (ii) The parties acknowledge and agree that each party has in place, or will develop, processes and procedures applicable to their performance hereunder as specified on Exhibit A (\"Integration  Services\"). The Integration Services shall be reviewed and assessed by the parties from time to time and may be amended or updated from time to time. Exhibit A shall be used as a guide for developing integrated service offerings to meet the needs of each party's clients, as applicable (in each instance, a \"Joint Solution\" or collectively, the \"Joint Solution\").   (iii) Where either party determines that an opportunity exists and is appropriate for the offering of the Joint Solution to that party's customer or client, it is the parties' mutual intent and commitment to collaborate, as needed, to propose the Joint Solution to that customer or client. Each party agrees to make a good faith effort to promote a Joint Solution for a Sponsor seeking services that could reasonably be addressed by the Joint Solution. In connection with PPD's response to a request for proposal (an \"RFP\") in which a Joint Solution is proposed, PPD shall be responsible for the preparation and submission of such RFP response; provided, however, that PPD shall provide VS an opportunity to review and provide approval on the Joint Solution framework, including, the scope of the Preferred Services and the pricing thereof. VS shall provide such review within two (2) business days following receipt by VS of such RFP response from PPD. Where reasonably appropriate for the proper defense of an RFP, PPD will use its reasonable efforts to provide VS an opportunity to participate in a call or bid defense meeting to the extent related to the Joint Solution. In the event PPD is awarded a clinical research study and such award includes selection by Sponsor of the Joint Solution, the parties shall mutually agree upon an applicable Work Order in accordance with Section 4 below.\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nA. However, nothing contained herein shall be construed to impose upon PPD an obligation to offer the Joint Solution or to use VS for Preferred Services where: (1) Sponsor is not in agreement, (2) VS's pricing is not competitive, or (3) there have been advances in technology not offered by VS.   B. Further, nothing contained herein shall enable either party to utilize the Joint Solution where the client has rejected the involvement of either party. For the avoidance of doubt, the Joint Solution shall only be utilized where both parties' services in furtherance of the Joint Solution have been retained by the client. Nonetheless, a client's selection or rejection of either party for services outside the Joint Solution shall in no way impact or impede a party from performing such services, regardless of the other party's selection or rejection by the client.   C. In the event either party discovers, directly or indirectly, technology not currently in use by the other party but which could improve the Preferred Services, PPD Services or the Joint Solution, the discovering party may elect to share such technology with the other party with the intent of integration by the other party. However, to the extent such other party elects not to integrate or otherwise use such technology, the discovering party shall not be prohibited from using that technology without the other party's involvement.   (iv) During the Term, VS acknowledges and agrees that, to the extent it is aware of an opportunity for clinical research services, it will refer such opportunity to PPD as soon as possible. VS shall not refer that opportunity to any other third party provider unless PPD declines to bid on such opportunity or does not offer the service in question. During the Term, PPD acknowledges and agrees that, to the extent it is aware of an opportunity for imaging services outside of the Joint Solution, it will refer such opportunity to VS as soon as possible. Unless otherwise required by a particular Sponsor, PPD shall not refer that opportunity to any other third party provider unless VS declines to bid on such opportunity or does not offer the service in question.\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n(v) During the Term of this Agreement, except as otherwise permitted by this Section 3(a)(v), VS agrees that it shall not enter into the same or substantially similar Commitments with any other company or entity which performs clinical research services the same or similar to those provided by PPD or any PPD affiliate (collectively, \"PPD Competitor\"), nor shall VS provide preferred pricing to a PPD Competitor which is better than that provided by VS hereunder to PPD. Further, during the Term of this Agreement, PPD agrees that it shall not enter into commitments which are the same or substantially similar to the PPD commitments set forth in Section 3 with any other imaging vendor for the performance of Preferred Services. In the event that, during the Term of this Agreement, VS desires to enter into the same or substantially similar Commitments with a PPD Competitor for imaging services outside of the Designated Therapeutic Areas (defined herein or in any amendment hereto), VS shall first notify PPD regarding the same and PPD shall have a right, for a period of 45 days following receipt of such notice (the \"Election Period\"), to elect to include such imaging services as \"Preferred Services\" hereunder (the \"Right of First Refusal\"). In the event PPD either (i) fails to respond within the Election Period or (ii) declines to include such imaging services as \"Preferred Services\" prior to termination of the Election Period, then in either such event, VS shall be permitted to pursue such relationship without being considered in violation of the Commitments or this Agreement. Additionally, in the event that PPD enters into a relationship with a VS competitor which provides for commitments which are the same or substantially similar to the Commitments in a therapeutic area outside the Designated Therapeutic Areas (defined herein or in any amendment hereto), VS shall have the right, without violating the Commitments or this Agreement (including the Right of First Refusal), to enter into a relationship with a PPD Competitor which provides for commitments which are the same or substantially similar to the Commitments outside the Designated Therapeutic Areas (defined herein or in any amendment hereto).   (vi) The parties shall form a Steering Committee comprised of high level personnel from each party which shall meet quarterly during the Term of this Agreement to oversee the implementation of this preferred relationship and the obligations set forth herein.   The Steering Committee shall be comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party. PPD's Steering Committee representatives shall be comprised of: Director, Finance; Therapeutic Head; Relationship Manager; Executive Director, Business Development; Executive Director, Information Technology; Medical Director, Global Drug Development. VS's Steering Committee representatives shall be comprised of: Chief Financial Officer; Chief Executive Officer/President; Director of Operations and Director of Project Management. Each party shall provide prior written notice to the other party of any desired change in Steering Committee representatives. Each party's Steering Committee representatives shall hold a position of sufficient level within its respective company to be able to obtain timely resolution of disputes submitted to the Steering Committee.\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the event a Sponsor shall raise concerns or issues with respect to any Preferred Services performed by VS in conjunction with   Sponsor's selection of the Joint Solution, which Preferred Services are agreed upon by the parties in an executed Work Order, VS and PPD shall mutually evaluate such concerns or issues prior to any communication with Sponsor and shall mutually agree upon an appropriate response to Sponsor related to such concerns or issues. The resolution of any such matters shall be submitted first to the parties' respective Project Manager for the study, and in the event such persons are unable to agree upon resolution, then to each parties' Relationship Manager/Senior Director and finally to the Therapeutic Head or equivalent position. The foregoing paragraph shall not be deemed to restrict a PPD project manager from ordinary course discussions with a Sponsor in order to collect information related to the nature of any such concerns or issues raised by Sponsor.   b. VS Commitment. VS agrees to continue to make investments in and improvements to those processes, technologies, techniques, software, hardware and methods which are integral or beneficial to the Services provided by VS, specifically but without limitation, to the Preferred Services.   c. PPD Commitment. Where PPD is in a position to make a recommendation to Sponsor with regard to imaging services, and VS is able to provide such imaging services in accordance with Sponsor's specifications, PPD agrees to recommend VS to Sponsor. PPD also agrees to maintain, when present, VS's name and logo on all VS generated deliverables to the Sponsor.   4. Compensation.   a. Each time VS is requested to perform Services, PPD shall provide VS with a work order or other similar written document mutually agreed upon by VS and PPD which shall set forth the specific services being requested, the compensation therefore and such other terms, conditions and specifications as VS and PPD may mutually agree (referred to herein as a \"Work Order\"). The parties acknowledge that no services shall be conducted by VS and no compensation shall be due and payable to VS without a Work Order.  In the event PPD receives a change order from a Sponsor which includes changes to VS's Services as set forth in an executed Work Order or may otherwise impact the provision by VS of Services to PPD hereunder, PPD shall promptly notify VS. Thereafter, the parties shall negotiate, in good faith, for an amendment to the applicable Work Order, as appropriate, as a result of such Sponsor change order.   b. VS shall be compensated for the Services in accordance with the Work Order. All pricing and rates used to establish the budget for Services set forth in each Work Order shall be in accordance with the pricing structures agreed upon by the parties herein and set forth in Exhibit B attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. PPD acknowledges that VS customarily receives an advance payment in connection with the provision of imaging services to its clients. PPD agrees that, where appropriate and permitted by the Sponsor, PPD will provide for an advance payment mutually determined by PPD and VS (and acceptable to Sponsor) in connection with the provision of Preferred Services to such Sponsor.     5\n\n\n\n\n\n    c. Exhibit B sets forth the pricing and rates for Preferred Services [***]. The prices and rates set forth in Exhibit B and the Discount and Booking thresholds set forth in Exhibit C shall remain in effect, without adjustment, during the Initial Term of this Agreement and may thereafter be updated to reflect changes in connection with any Renewal of this Agreement, as specified in Section 1 herein.   [*** 2.5 paragraphs omitted]   Upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason, VS shall no longer have any obligation to provide PPD with any Discount with respect to Preferred Services nor shall VS be required to offer VS Preferred Pricing [***]. The parties acknowledge and agree that the VS Preferred Pricing [***] shall apply to, and remain in effect for, all active Work Orders issued hereunder, regardless of the expiration or termination of this Agreement, as well as for any timeline extensions to an active Work Order, provided that in the case of a timeline extension, the parties may mutually agree to apply an inflation rate for the extension period. In the event a Work Order shall be amended in any respect (including with respect to the scope of the Preferred Services, the timing for the delivery thereof, or otherwise), the VS Preferred Pricing [***] applicable to any Preferred Services included in such amendment and the Discount shall be the VS Preferred Pricing [***] and the Discount in effect on the date of the original Work Order. The parties further acknowledge and agree that VS Preferred Pricing [***] shall be applicable to any agreed upon expansion of the Preferred Services. With respect to any Services provided to PPD hereunder, PPD shall charge each Sponsor the actual invoiced amounts charged by VS to PPD for such Services without any mark-up or administrative or other fee, unless VS has agreed otherwise in writing in the applicable Work Order.   d. Additionally, PPD shall reimburse VS for all reasonable expenses incurred in the course of performing the Services which are set forth in the Work Order. VS shall maintain a complete accounting of all expenses incurred and shall include such accounting with VS's invoice submitted to PPD. Expenses incurred must be invoiced separately and must include an expense report along with original receipts for such expenses.   e. VS shall submit monthly invoices to PPD detailing its activities and fees in accordance with Section 5 of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, invoices must be submitted to PPD within thirty (30) days of performing the Service or incurring the expense. PPD shall have no obligation to issue payment to VS for Services performed or expenses incurred which were not invoiced to PPD in accordance with this Agreement.   f. VS acknowledges and agrees that where VS's Services relate to a specific Sponsor's clinical research study, all payments under a Work Order are pass through payments from Sponsor and PPD shall not have any payment obligations until such payments are received from Sponsor. PPD shall use all reasonable diligence to obtain timely payment from Sponsor in order to make payment to VS within 45 days following the date of invoice receipt. In furtherance thereof, PPD shall ensure that Sponsor is invoiced no later than ten (10) days following PPD's receipt of VS's invoice, assuming such invoice was provided to PPD by VS in accordance herewith and provided that Sponsor's invoice requirements do not preclude the same. PPD shall ensure that VS is aware of any such Sponsor restrictions as soon as possible. Further, PPD shall ensure that payment is made to VS either by wire transfer or PPD check in accordance with PPD's applicable payment processes no later than ten (10) days following PPD's receipt of applicable funds from Sponsor; provided, however, that in the event such payment occurs more than 45 days following the date of PPD's receipt of VS' invoice, such payment shall be made by wire transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a Sponsor fails to issue payment to PPD, affecting PPD's ability to pay VS, the parties shall communicate with the other to jointly pursue communication with the Sponsor to address the non\u00adpayment.\n\n[***] Represents material which has been redacted and filed separately with the Commission pursuant to a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\ng. Where PPD and Sponsor have agreed upon and captured in a fully executed contract any bonus/penalty or other similar, milestone based incentive provisions, and PPD's ability to meet the terms of such provisions will be impacted by VS's Services, PPD and VS may mutually agree, case by case, to flow through to the applicable Work Order all or agreed upon portions of such bonuses, penalties or incentives.   5. Invoices and Billing Account Number. PPD shall assign a billing account number (\"Purchase Order Number\") to VS for the Services in each Work Order. All VS invoices must reference the Purchase Order Number, Service fees, any PPD pre-approved expenses incurred by VS, the remittance address, and the total amount of compensation owed to VS. These invoices must be sent to the following address: PPD, 929 North Front Street, Wilmington, NC 28401, Attention: Accounts Payable.   6. Independent Contractor. VS shall perform all Services under this Agreement as an independent contractor and not as an employee, partner or agent of PPD. As such, VS shall be solely responsible for the payment of all taxes, payroll deductions and similar items associated with compensation for its services under this Agreement as may be required by applicable law. VS acknowledges that as an independent contractor it will not be entitled to insurance or other benefits made available to employees of PPD.   7. Additional Personnel. VS shall have the authority to utilize a third party vendor as may be required to perform the Services (\"Subcontractors\"); provided, however, that:   a. Subcontractors must be approved in advance by PPD, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.   b .  VS shall be responsible for all taxes, payroll deductions and similar items which may result from the retention of such Subcontractors to assist in the performance of VS's obligations under this Agreement.   c. Compensation for the services of said Subcontractor shall be paid to VS by PPD on a pass-through basis and at no profit to VS.   d. Any such Subcontractor and its employees or other personnel shall be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement with respect to representations and warranties, privacy, confidential information, intellectual property, indemnification, debarment, record keeping and audit (see Sections 8, 9, 10, 12, 14 and 15), which provisions shall be incorporated into a written agreement between VS and such Subcontractor.   e. Notwithstanding the foregoing, VS shall remain responsible for the actions of all of the Subcontractors retained by VS.\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Representation and Warranties. VS represents and warrants that it shall utilize independent discretion and judgment in discharging its responsibilities in a timely, professional and workmanlike manner in accordance with internationally accepted standards, and shall, at all times: (i) use individuals of suitable training and skill to perform its duties and responsibilities under this Agreement, if applicable; (ii) be in possession of all the necessary facilities, resources and personnel required to perform its duties and responsibilities under this Agreement; and (iii) comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and guidelines.   Further, VS represents and warrants that it has all of the necessary licenses, permits and/or registrations to perform the Services in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and that during the Term of this Agreement, all such licenses, permits and/or registrations are and shall remain current and in good standing.   [*** 1 paragraph omitted]   9. Confidential Information. It is understood and agreed that any and all information which may be made available to, learned by or generated by either party during the Term of this Agreement, including without limitation, information relating to the other party's businesses, its affiliates or the Sponsor, Sponsor's protocol, and this Agreement (collectively, \"Confidential Information\"), is to be treated as strictly confidential (the party disclosing such Confidential Information, the \"Disclosing Party\" and the party receiving such Confidential Information, the \"Receiving Party\", with the understanding that either term may include, as applicable, an affiliate of either party). Confidential Information shall be used solely in connection with performance hereunder or as otherwise may be necessary for a party to fulfill its obligations to a customer or client and shall not to be published or disclosed to any third parties other than the Receiving Party's employees on a strict need\u00adto\u00adknow basis and provided that such employee is under a similar written and enforceable obligation to keep such information strictly confidential. Further, nothing contained herein shall prevent PPD from disclosing VS Confidential Information to PPD's customers and clients solely to the extent directly related to the provision of Services to such customer or client. The nondisclosure obligations set forth in this Section 9 shall not apply to any portion of Confidential Information (i) which is, or subsequently may, become within the knowledge of the general public other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party; (ii) which is known to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis at the time of receipt thereof from the Disclosing Party; (iii) which may subsequently be rightfully obtained from a third party not bound by an obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party, or (iv) which is required by any law, rule, regulation, order, decision, decree, subpoena or other judicial, administrative or legal process to be disclosed, provided that the Disclosing Party receives prior written notice of such disclosure and that the Receiving Party takes all reasonable and lawful actions to obtain confidential treatment for such disclosure and, if possible, to minimize the extent of such disclosure.   Receiving Party shall take reasonable care of all Confidential Information entrusted to it by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party or Sponsor, and shall return such materials to the Disclosing Party or Sponsor (as the case may be) immediately upon expiration or termination of this Agreement.   Both parties agree to handle all information containing personal data in accordance with all applicable privacy laws, rules, and regulations.\n\n[***] Represents material which has been redacted and filed separately with the Commission pursuant to a request for confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Intellectual Property. Nothing contained herein, nor the delivery of any information to either party hereunder, shall be deemed to grant the other party a right or license under any patent or patent application or to any know-how, technology, invention or other intellectual property of the other party or of the Sponsor.   All inventions, patents, know-how, trademarks, copyrights, information, data, software, methodologies, writings and other property in any form whatsoever, which are provided to either party and which were owned or controlled by the providing party (\"Originator\") shall remain the sole property of the Originator.   The parties' ownership rights in any inventions, patents, trademarks, copyrights, software, methodologies, writings and other property in any form whatsoever that results out of the development of a Joint Solution shall be addressed by the parties by separate written agreement which may include, an applicable Work Order and/or an amendment to this Agreement (\"Intellectual Property Amendment\") .   Unless otherwise addressed in an Intellectual Property Amendment, VS hereby assigns to PPD (or Sponsor as the case may be) all rights that VS may have in any invention, technology, know-how or other intellectual property which is developed with use of Confidential Information provided to VS by PPD. Additionally, VS shall assist PPD (or Sponsor), at PPD's (or Sponsor's) sole cost and expense, in obtaining or extending protection therefor.   Unless otherwise addressed in an Intellectual Property Amendment, PPD hereby assigns to VS all rights that PPD may have in any invention, technology, know-how or other intellectual property which is developed with use of Confidential Information provided to PPD by VS. Additionally, PPD shall assist VS, at the sole cost and expense of VS, in obtaining or extending protection therefor.   11. Termination. Either party may terminate this Agreement, without cause, upon ninety (90) days prior written notice to the other party, provided, however, that all outstanding Work Orders shall continue to be governed by the terms and conditions hereof. Either party may terminate this Agreement, or a relevant Work Order, immediately, upon the occurrence of any of the following for cause events: (a) either party's material breach of the commitments set forth in Section 3; (b) either party commences a voluntary proceeding under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or an involuntary case or proceeding is commenced against a party under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law; (c) significant audit findings are identified by the other party, a Sponsor, or an applicable regulatory authority; or (d) significant operational deficiencies that are not resolved in accordance with the Steering Committee determinations following escalation. PPD shall further be permitted to terminate this Agreement or a relevant Work Order, immediately, for cause, upon the occurrence of any of the following: (a) VS's failure to meet the agreed upon timelines, provided that such failure is due to circumstances within VS's reasonable control; (b) VS's failure to provide pricing which is reasonably competitive; (c) a change of ownership equal to fifty percent (50%) or more in the outstanding voting securities of VS; (d) the acquisition of a number of VS's outstanding voting securities by a PPD Competitor that would require disclosure by such PPD Competitor pursuant to Rule 13d-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (a \"Significant Ownership Position\"); (e) a change in any VS Key Leadership Position.   In the event Sponsor, with or without cause, terminates, or requests that PPD terminate, VS's involvement in a project, PPD shall have the right to immediately terminate the Work Order to which such project relates. Additionally, in the event the services requested of PPD by Sponsor are cancelled or put on hold or the services agreement between PPD and Sponsor is terminated, PPD may terminate any relevant Work Order immediately upon notice to VS. In the event any Work Order is terminated, PPD shall pay VS for all Services performed in accordance with the Work Order through the date of termination plus any agreed upon costs necessary to close-out the Work Order (which costs shall be documented in a Work Order amendment if not included in the Work Order) and any non-cancelable expenses incurred prior to the termination of such Work Order, provided VS makes all reasonable attempts to mitigate such non-cancelable expenses.\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n12. Indemnification. VS shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless PPD, its affiliates, directors, officers and employees thereof for any and all damages, costs, expenses and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred by any such party as a result of any claim, action or proceeding by a third party (a \"Third Party Claim\") arising from VS's negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of this Agreement.

Either indemnified party shall give the indemnifying party prompt notice of any Third Party Claim for which indemnification is sought hereunder. The indemnifying party shall have the right to control the defense and settlement of such Third Party Claim, provided the indemnifying party shall act reasonably and in good faith with respect to all matters relating to the settlement or disposition of the claim, and the indemnified party shall reasonably cooperate in the investigation, defense and settlement of such claim. The indemnified party shall have the right to participate in, but not control, the defense and settlement of a claim and to employ separate legal counsel of its own choice; provided, however, that such employment shall be at the indemnified party's own expense, unless (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the indemnifying party, or (ii) the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel (in which case the indemnified party shall control the defense and settlement of such claim).   13.

Further, VS shall inform PPD within one (1) business day of being notified of an audit by any regulatory authority or by any Sponsor to the extent such audit relates to the Preferred Services, the Joint Solution or a Work Order hereunder. PPD or its representatives shall be permitted to be present at and directly communicate with such regulatory authority or Sponsor representatives (as the case may be) concerning any matters related to the Preferred Services, the Joint Solution or a Work Order hereunder arising in connection with such audit. To the extent permitted by the auditing entity, VS shall ensure that PPD is provided with copies of any written communications, reports and findings resulting from any inspection of VS by that regulatory authority or Sponsor to the extent related to the Preferred Services, the Joint Solution or a Work Order. To the extent any such communications, reports or findings require action by VS, VS shall include with such copies its remedial plan of action, including timelines for completion of the same. To the extent such remedial plan of action impacts the Preferred Services or Joint Solution, and, where applicable, to the extent permitted by the relevant regulatory authority, VS shall collaborate with PPD prior to developing or implementing any changes to the Preferred Services or Joint Solution as a result of the audit findings.   16. Insurance. VS represents and warrants that it has and will maintain during the Term of this Agreement and, additionally, where applicable, during the term of any active Work Order, and for a period of two (2) years following expiration or termination of either, insurance in the types and limits generally accepted in the industry. Upon request, VS shall provide PPD with a copy of its certificate of insurance.   17. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.   18. Assignment.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, neither party shall use the name, insignia, symbol, trademark, trade name, logo, logotype, or any abbreviation or adaptation thereof, of the other party or any affiliate of the other party, in any publication, press release, promotional material or other form of publicity, nor will either party use the same as verbal endorsement of its services, without the prior written approval of the other party in each instance. Further, VS shall be similarly restricted as it pertains to Sponsor and any Sponsor affiliate. The restrictions imposed by this Section shall not prohibit the parties from making any disclosure identifying the other party that is required by any applicable law, rule or regulation. Additionally, following final execution of this Agreement, the parties acknowledge and agree that a joint press release statement regarding the parties' preferred relationship and its impact on the parties' ability to provide Services hereunder shall be prepared and mutually agreed upon prior to its release or use by either party.   20.

Miscellaneous.   a. By agreeing to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and performing the Services for PPD, VS is representing that it is not in violation of any terms and conditions of any agreement with any other individual or entity.   b.

(\"Jasper\") in [***];\n\nWHEREAS, Premier is the owner of certain proprietary formulations, manufacturing processes and techniques and wishes to have Product manufactured and packaged by Heritage in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein;\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and intending to be legally bound, the Parties agree as follows: 1.

PRODUCTION OF PRODUCT\n\n(a) Heritage shall produce the products described on Schedule A attached hereto, as may be amended by the Parties hereafter from time to time (the \"Products\"), for Premier at [***] Heritage's or Heritage's wholly owned subsidiary, Jasper's, [***] (the \"Facilities\"). [***] For the purposes of this paragraph, [***] facilities located at [***] are considered one Facility. Any facility that Heritage wishes to use, other than [***] to manufacture the Products must be approved by Premier in writing, in advance. For the avoidance of doubt, Heritage's [***] facility must be approved by Premier before it may be used to manufacture the Products. Such facility approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Premier's facility approval will be based, in part, on the successful completion of a trial production run that is sufficient in meeting finished product specifications, and an evaluation of the stability and specifications of trial production product within [***] of the trial production run.\n\n(b) Heritage and Premier agree that all Products subject to this Agreement, and their current and subsequently modified respective formulas are confidential and proprietary, and the sole property of Premier unless otherwise agreed in writing by both Parties.\n\n(c) Minimum Annual Order Volume. During the Term of this Agreement, Premier shall be required to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (\"MAOV\") of [***] (\"Units\") for each twelve-month period commencing July 1, 2017, and for the six-month period commencing July 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022, Premier will be required to purchase [***] Units (the twelve-month periods and the six month period are each a \"Contract Period\").\n\n(d) During the Term, Premier shall have the right (but not the obligation) to order from Heritage quantities of Products in excess of [***] and provided Heritage has the capacity and the ability to produce such additional quantities of Products, Heritage agrees to produce such additional quantities per the pricing and terms on Schedule C.\n\n(e) [***]\n\n(f) [***]\n\n(g) Within [***] of each calendar month during the Term, Premier shall provide to Heritage a [***] rolling production forecast which shall set forth Premier's non-binding good faith estimated purchases (each, a \"Forecast\") for the [***] period commencing on the date thereof (the \"Forecast Delivery Date\"). Each Forecast shall also designate which Facility shall manufacture the Products set forth in such Forecast (i.e. Heritage's [***] Facility, Jasper's [***] Facility, or some other facility agreed to by the Parties). Heritage shall notify Premier, in writing (or email), within [***] of each Forecast Delivery Date, if Heritage's or Jasper's Facilities will not be able to fulfill Premier's estimated purchases as set out in the [***] of such Forecast. For the avoidance of doubt, the [***] are 2\n\nSource: BELLRING BRANDS, INC., S-1, 9/20/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nthe [***] immediately following the Forecast Delivery Date. If Heritage notifies Premier that it can fulfill Premier's Forecast for this [***] period, or if it fails to notify Premier that it cannot fulfill that portion of the Forecast, Heritage shall be obligated to fulfill, or cause Jasper to fulfill as applicable, if ordered through POs, the full amount of Product set forth for purchase during [***] (\"Firm Forecast\").\n\n(h) Within the [***] of each calendar month during the Term, Heritage shall provide to Premier a [***] rolling production forecast which shall set forth Heritage's good faith estimated maximum monthly unit volume (\"Maximum Volume\") for each Facility during such [***] period. Modifications to the Maximum Volume shall be negotiated in good faith and agreed upon by both Parties in writing or email by the [***] of the calendar month.\n\n(i) Premier shall provide Heritage with Purchase Orders (or \"POs\") [***] in advance of the date referred to as the \"Due Date\" in such POs. The POs, at a minimum, will give the Products and quantities ordered, the Due Date requested, and designate which Facility will manufacture the Products. \"Due Date\" shall mean the production start date requested by Premier.\n\n(j) Within [***] of receipt of a PO, Heritage shall (i) provide to Premier email confirmation of acceptance of the PO, a schedule of production and an estimated production completion date (the \"Estimated Completion Date\"), or (ii) notify Premier if any term of the PO cannot be met. Heritage's failure to notify Premier, within the time specified herein, of an inability to meet a term of the PO shall constitute acceptance of such PO in its entirety. If Heritage notifies Premier that it or Jasper cannot meet the Due Date, the Parties shall discuss an acceptable alternate date on which production will commence (the \"Production Date\"). Once a Due Date is accepted or a Production Date is mutually agreed upon, Heritage shall, or shall cause Jasper to, use all commercially reasonable efforts to start production on or before the Due Date (or Production Date, as applicable), but in no case more than [***] earlier or later than the Due Date (or Production Date, as applicable) unless mutually agreed otherwise by Premier.\n\n(k) If PREMIER requests that Products be produced at the Heritage Facility, Heritage may either produce such Products at the Heritage Facility or cause Jasper to produce such Products at the Jasper Facility, in which case Heritage shall be responsible for all shipping costs of transporting the Products to the Heritage Facility. If Premier requests that Products be produced at the Jasper Facility, Heritage may either cause Jasper to produce such Products at the Jasper Facility or produce such Products at the Heritage Facility, in which case Heritage shall be responsible for all shipping costs of transporting the Products to the Jasper Facility.\n\n(l) If a PO is accepted by Heritage as described in Section 2(j) above but such PO is not filled in accordance with its terms, or if Heritage or Jasper, as applicable, fails to complete production of the Products [***], Premier shall have the right to use an alternate co-packer for the Products specified in the PO and Heritage shall, or shall cause Jasper to, provide Premier with Premier owned packaging needed to support such production by an alternate co-packer.\n\n(m) Purchase Orders will be Premier's best estimate of its current requirements, but may be amended up or down or canceled in their entirety by Premier to reflect changing demand for Products. The final Unit quantities on Premier's Purchase Orders will count towards the MAOV. However, if (i) any increase or decrease in Unit volume under a particular PO is greater than [***] of the initial PO quantity and (ii) Premier requests such change or cancellation within the [***] period prior to the Due Date (or Production Date, as applicable) (the \"[***] Period\"), Heritage in its sole discretion, may charge Premier [***]. In no event shall Premier pay [***] if (i) it cancels or modifies any PO prior to the commencement of the [***] Period (i.e.; prior to the commencement of the [***] period preceding the Due Date (or Production Date, as applicable), (ii) Heritage or Jasper fails to timely start production in the [***] period before or after the Due Date (or Production Date, as applicable), or (iii) the basis for Premier's cancellation is a breach by Heritage of its obligations, representations or warranties hereunder. 3\n\nSource: BELLRING BRANDS, INC., S-1, 9/20/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n(n) Heritage shall within [***] after the end of the production run, notify Premier via email of the final estimated production quantity and the estimated quantity, including losses, of all Premier-supplied materials used. If the final production quantity for any accepted PO is less than [***] of the PO quantity ordered, or if the quantity of production released for shipment within [***] from the last day of production is less than [***] of the PO quantity, upon request by Premier, Heritage shall take all commercially reasonable steps to produce or replace the shortfall within [***]. The final production quantity by Heritage and Jasper will count towards the MAOV requirements.\n\n(o) Heritage represents and warrants that:\n\n(i) All Products manufactured, packaged and delivered by Heritage or Jasper under the terms of this Agreement shall conform to the specifications supplied to Heritage by Premier as listed on Schedule A, which Schedule may from time to time be modified by Premier in writing (the \"Specifications\"), shall conform to Post Holdings' Quality Expectations Manual attached hereto as Schedule E, and shall conform in all material respects to samples previously supplied to Premier by Heritage.
