Jazz for Service Management underpins client defined management scenarios such as cloud; performance monitoring; and IT service management.\n\nJazz for Service Management has a number of integration services: Dashboard Services provided by IBM\u00ae Dashboard Application Services Hub and Reporting Services.\n\nFor more information about Jazz for Service Management; see the Jazz for Service Management documentation [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEKCU_1.1.3.0/com.ibm.psc.doc/psc_ic-homepage.html].\n\nVersion 1.1.3.0 is a full refresh of Jazz for Service Management Version 1.1 Base with Modification 3. \n\n\n\nDOWNLOADING JAZZ FOR SERVICE MANAGEMENT ELECTRONIC IMAGES\nYou can download images by using the IBM Download Director applet or HTTP. If possible choose Download Director; because it automatically verifies the completeness of each image that it processes.\n\nTip: If you use Download Director to download the software; then you can also use it to extract the contents of all the compressed files that you downloaded in the session.\n\n\n 1.  Before you start the installation; check the Jazz for Service Management Technotes [http://www.ibm.com/support/search.wss?q=jazzsm1130relnotes] for late breaking issues or updated installation instructions.\n 2.  Determine the set of platform-specific images to download for the installation scenario or integration services to install; as summarized in the following table. Scenario Images Full installation; all integration services and middleware  * Jazz\u2122 for Service Management 1.1.3.0\n      * IBM\u00ae Tivoli\u00ae Common Reporting 3.1.3.0\n      * IBM\u00ae WebSphere\u00ae Application Server 8.5.5.9\n      * IBM\u00ae DB2\u00ae Enterprise Server Edition 10.5\n     \n     Custom installation; Dashboard Application Services Hub  * Jazz\u2122 for Service Management 1.1.3.0\n      * IBM\u00ae WebSphere\u00ae Application Server 8.5.5.9; optional if already installed\n      * IBM\u00ae WebSphere\u00ae Application Server V8.5 Supplements; for high availability environment only\n      * IBM\u00ae DB2\u00ae Enterprise Server Edition 10.5; for high availability environment only\n     \n     Custom installation; Reporting Services  * Jazz\u2122 for Service Management 1.1.3.0\n      * IBM\u00ae Tivoli\u00ae Common Reporting 3.1.3.0\n      * IBM\u00ae WebSphere\u00ae Application Server 8.5.5.9; optional if already installed\n      * IBM\u00ae DB2\u00ae Enterprise Server Edition 10.5; optional if already installed\n     \n     \n 3.  Create one or more of the following temporary directories in the same file system:  * JazzSM_Image_Home directory; which refers to the directory that will contain the extracted contents of the Jazz for Service Management platform-specific image.\n      * Image_Imgs_Home directory; which refers to the directory that will contain the extracted contents of platform-specific images for middleware. Tip: You only create this directory if you intend to install IBM DB2\u00ae; IBM WebSphere\u00ae Application Server.\n        \n        \n     \n     \n 4.   Navigate to the IBM Passport Advantage web site [http://www.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage/pao_customers.htm]. \n     Note: You require an IBM Customer ID to sign in and continue.\n 5.  Select the Find by part number search option under Download finder options.\n 6.  Search for each downloadable image by part number; as outlined in the relevant Operating_System tab in this download document.\n 7.  Select and download only the images for your platform that you need.\n 8.  Extract the downloaded images into directories that you created in step 3. \n     \n     Important: If you have downloaded the middleware and you want to perform a full installation; ensure that your Install_Imgs_Home directory is set up as follows:\n     |-ESE (Windows) [extracted DB2 installation image on Windows] \n     |-ese (UNIX) [extracted DB2 installation image on AIX; Linux; or Linux for System z] \n     |-WASRepository [extracted WebSphere Application Server installation image]\n     |-TCRCognos [extracted Tivoli Common Reporting Cognos\u00ae installation image] This directory structure is not required for a custom installation; for example; installing a subset of integration services by using the launchpad custom workflow or IBM Installation Manager GUI.\n     \n     \n 9.  To perform a full installation; download the Quick Start image with a part number of CNC1MML. It contains quick start guides for these installation scenarios.  * CNC1MML_JazzSM_lang_code.pdf - Quick start guide for the full installation scenario; to install all Jazz for Service Management integration services; IBM DB2\u00ae; and IBM WebSphere\u00ae Application Server on a single server for evaluation and development purposes. \n     \n     \n 10. If you want to perform a custom installation; for example; install only a subset of Jazz for Service Management integration services or use existing supported installations of WebSphere Application Server or DB2; see Custom installation scenario [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEKCU_1.1.3.0/com.ibm.psc.doc/install/psc_c_install_advanced_opt.html] in the Jazz for Service Management documentation.\n\n\n\nTAB NAVIGATION\n * AIX\u00ae\n * Linux\n * Linux on System z\u00ae\n * Windows\n\n\n\nSee Jazz for Service Management Detailed System Requirements [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038732] for the AIX operating systems on which Jazz for Service Management is supported.\n\nDownloadable images with part numbers\n\nYou can download electronic images for Jazz for Service Management and its database and application server middleware.

A restricted shell is often used to allow a user to run one or more applications, but prevent the user from executing most AIX commands and from changing the current working directory. Both the Bourne shell and Korn shell can be started in restricted shell mode. The characteristics of a restricted shell are similar for these two shells, so this document will focus primarily on the Korn shell since it is the more modern of the two shells.\n\nWhat are the restrictions imposed by a restricted shell?\n\nA restricted shell imposes the following restrictions:\n\n\n 1. It will not execute the cd command.\n    \n    \n 2. It will not allow modification to the following system environment variables; SHELL, ENV, and PATH.\n    \n    \n 3. It will not allow a program to be executed by specifying a path to the program that includes a / character. This means only commands in the current path can be executed. For example, you cannot run a command such as /usr/bin/date or ./date. It is possible to run the date command without specifying a path, but only if the PATH environment variable includes a directory that contains the date command.\n    \n    \n 4. It will not redirect output with >, >|, <>, or >>\n    \n    \n 5. It will not return to a shell prompt if it receives an interrupt such as the one generated by Ctrl-C when processing the shell startup files such as /etc/environment and .profile.\n    \n\nIt should be noted that the restrictions listed above are not enough by themselves to limit access to commands by a user. For example, if the PATH environment variable includes the /usr/bin directory, as it does by default, a user will be able to run commands located in /usr/bin. One of these commands will be ksh, which means a user running the restricted shell can easily exit out of the restricted shell by simply running ksh to start another shell that will run in normal, full access mode. As described later in this document, additional steps must be taken to further restrict access by a user. \n\nHow do I start a restricted shell?\n\nA restricted shell can be started in one of two ways. Note that the operation of the restricted shell is slightly different between these two methods.\n * By using the restricted shell option -r when running the shell command. The Bourne shell can be started as a restricted shell with the command bsh -r, and the Korn shell with the command ksh -r. When a shell is started with the -r option, the shell will enforce restrictions when processing /etc/environment and .profile.\n   \n   \n * By running a hard link to the shell that has a file name recognized by the shell as a command to run the shell in restricted shell mode. The hard link file name for the Bourne shell is Rsh and for the Korn shell rksh. When a shell is started with Rsh or rksh, restrictions are not enforced until after /etc/environment and .profile have been processed. This is the method most commonly used to start a restricted shell. On currently supported versions of AIX, these hard links are automatically installed in /usr/bin. If you are on a system that does not have the hard links below, you can easily create them with the ln command.\n   \n   # pwd \n   /usr/bin \n   \n   # ls -il Rsh \n   1124 -r-xr-xr-x 2 bin bin 1726412 Mar 22 2009 Rsh \n   # ls -il bsh \n   1124 -r-xr-xr-x 2 bin bin 1726412 Mar 22 2009 bsh \n   \n   # ls -il rksh \n   1501 -r-xr-xr-x 5 bin bin 247238 Mar 13 2009 rksh \n   # ls -il ksh \n   1501 -r-xr-xr-x 5 bin bin 247238 Mar 13 2009 ksh\n   \n   Note: The inodes are identical for Rsh and bsh, and for rksh and ksh. When the Bourne shell or Korn shell is starting up it looks at the name of the command used to invoke it, and if the name is the restricted shell name, it will operate in restricted mode.\n   \n\nWhich restricted shell should I use?\n\nThe Korn shell has more features than the older Bourne shell, so the Korn restricted shell is usually a better choice. Regardless of which shell is used, you will need to decide if you want to start the restricted shell with the -r option, or the restricted shell command. As previously mentioned, the -r option causes the shell to begin enforcing restrictions when sourcing shell startup files, whereas the restricted shell commands Rsh and rksh do not enforce restrictions on these startup files. The restricted shell commands are the most commonly used methods for starting a restricted shell because they allow full shell operation during the processing of .profile, and this allows a system administrator to use .profile to further restrict access by the user. \n\nHow do I add more restrictions? \n\nSimply setting a user's default shell with the chsh command is usually not enough to provide adequate restrictions for a user. But a restricted shell can be used in combination with other steps to alter the user's environment to further limit the user's access to the system. This can be accomplished by restricting permissions on files and directories and setting environment variables in the user's .profile that the user will not be able to modify. The example that follows provides all of the steps necessary for installing a restricted Korn shell for a user, specifying which commands the user can run, and preventing the user from modifying the environment to bypass the restrictions. Because the user's .profile will be used to set up the restricted environment, we will need full shell access when processing .profile, so we will use the rksh command to start the restricted shell. Run the following commands as root. \n 1. If a file named rksh does not exist in /usr/bin, create a hard link named rksh linked to ksh.\n    # ln /usr/bin/ksh /usr/bin/rksh\n    \n    \n 2. If it does not already exist, use a text editor to add rksh to the usw: stanza in /etc/security/login.cfg.\n    \n    \n 3. Change the default shell for the user to rksh.\n    # chsh <userName> /user/bin/rksh\n    \n    \n 4. Create a .profile in the user's home directory and set the PATH environment variable to a directory containing all of the commands you want the user to be able to run.\n    export PATH=/usr/bin/restricted\n    \n    \n 5. Create the directory that will contain the commands.\n    # mkdir /usr/bin/restricted\n    \n    \n 6. Put the commands you want the user to be able to run into /usr/bin/restricted. In this example, we will create symbolic links to the date and ps commands and put the links into /usr/bin/restricted. The user will only be able to run these two commands.\n    # cd /usr/bin/restricted\n    # ln -s /usr/bin/date date\n    # ln -s /usr/bin/ps ps\n    \n    \n 7. Prevent the user from modifying .profile. Replace <userName> with the name of the home directory for the user.\n    # cd /home/<userName>\n    # chown bin:bin .profile /home/<userName>\n    # chmod -w .profile /home/<userName>\n    \n\nNow when the user logs in, the restricted shell will run as the default login shell and read the .profile, which will set PATH to /usr/bin/restricted so that the user will only be able to run the date and ps commands. The restricted shell will not allow the user to change PATH, and the permissions on .profile will not allow the user to alter the environment to bypass the restrictions during the next login session. \n\nConclusion \n\nA restricted shell can be used to limit a user's access to the system. However the limitations provided by a restricted shell are not enough to prevent a user from running unauthorized commands. To do this, additional steps must be taken to alter the user's environment. The limitations provided by the restricted shell will prevent the user from modifying the environment to bypass the restrictions. The example provided in this document is one way to use the restricted shell to limit access by a user.", "document_id": "isg3T1011970", "all_doc_ids": ["swg21663259", "swg1LO68498", "swg21686886", "isg3T1025553", "swg21410854", "swg21694536", "swg21669386", "swg21134538", "swg21547989", "swg21430823", "swg21380356", "swg21374266", "swg21253294", "swg1IV00723", "swg21506217", "isg3T1011970", "swg21325184", "swg1IZ24819", "swg21992281", "swg21587152", "swg21540271", "swg1IZ68071", "swg21968845", "swg21538019", "swg21392038", "swg21049916", "swg21144408", "swg1PI20969", "swg21989502", "swg21150818", "swg1PM91194", "swg21549626", "swg1HD95245", "swg21985583", "swg21562381", "nas8N1014746", "swg21531477", "swg21534189", "swg21541302", "swg21119859", "swg21537237", "isg3T1014349", "swg1IZ74323", "swg1LO60567", "swg21981434", "swg21590130", "swg21225507", "swg1IZ78070", "swg21524484", "swg1PI18857"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I purchased the SPSS grad pack and put one of the licenses on one computer and another on this one.

For key export to work, various conditions must be met: \n\n * HSMs must be initialized and in the same key sharing domain on exporting and importing machines \n * The private key in question must be marked exportable at keygen time (see keygen's exportable option) \n * HSMs on exporting and importing machines must share internal key-wrapping keys (see hsm-clone-kwk command). A key-wrapping key is a key that encrypts another key.\n\n\nEach HSM has a special key inside of it, the key-wrapping key, that is used to encrypt exported private keys (and to decrypt imported private keys). If the goal is to restore exported keys to the same appliance, then you don't need to worry about hsm-clone-kwk, red keys, or the hsm-domain parameter. That is because the key-wrapping key at import time will already match the key-wrapping key at export time (since the HSM device is the same). If the goal is to move exported keys from one appliance to another one, then all of the steps in this section must be followed :- \n\nFirst, the two HSMs in question must be both be initialized and in the same key sharing domain. This means that they must both be initialized in the same mode (both in Security Level 2 or both in Security Level 3). In Security Level 2 mode, they must have used the same hsm-domain parameter during hsm-reinit (this parameter has a default value that is the same on all appliances). In Security Level 3 mode, they must have used the same red PED key during hsm-reinit (and the second initialization must not have overwritten the key value from the first initialization). \n\nSecond, the key to be exported must be exportable. The exportability of keys is immutable. It is determined at keygen time, and it is controlled by that command's exportable parameter. If a key was created outside of the appliance (not using keygen), then it is always considered exportable. \n\nFinally, before the crypto-export crypto-import sequence, the key-wrapping keys must be synchronized using the hsm-clone-kwk command. This command must be run four times: once on the source HSM appliance (with the key-wrapping key you are copying), once on the destination HSM appliance, once again on the source HSM appliance, and once again on the destination HSM appliance. Each time the command is run, it will need the output file from the previous step (as the input to the current step) which must be moved manually (usually with the copy command). \n\nOnce all of this has been done, then private keys may move from system to system with crypto-export and crypto-import. \n\nNote that the non-HSM appliance can export keys immediately at keygen time, but never at a later time. \n\nFor additional information refer to the online Info Center [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wsdatap/v3r8m2/index.jsp?topic=%2Fxi50%2Fwelcome.htm] and search for \"PIN entry device\".\n\nNote: You will need to sign into the documentation portal with your IBM Registration ID and password.", "document_id": "swg21412061", "all_doc_ids": ["swg21412060", "swg1IT01034", "swg21446015", "swg21412061", "swg1IT07604", "swg1IT17122", "swg21273347", "swg21255841", "swg1IT08761", "swg1IT06901", "swg21516505", "swg21507058", "swg21599770", "swg1IT09865", "swg27048270", "swg1IT10355", "swg21388551", "swg1IT10061", "swg21508029", "swg1IT11997", "swg21402883", "swg21235587", "swg1IC96920", "swg21380695", "swg1IC93730", "swg1IT06671", "swg1IT12635", "swg21587018", "swg1IT07237", "swg1IT17125", "swg21417566", "swg1IT02925", "swg1IC94339", "swg21358525", "swg24032265", "swg1IT14139", "swg1IT14128", "swg1IT17603", "swg1IC80143", "swg21511856", "swg21250655", "swg21249208", "swg21501021", "swg21642721", "swg1IT08435", "swg21470831", "swg1IT15442", "swg1LI77490", "swg1IT11169", "swg1IC68085"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "During our latest deployment of a larger process application we received the following error\n\nThe transaction log for database 'BPMDB' is full.

Both are included as downloadable tools from within IBM Support Assistant Workbench [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/isa/]. \n\n\n\n\nLocating the Core Dump \n\nFor WebSphere Application Server installations, the default location for the core dumps is in the profile's root directory: <WAS_HOME>/profiles/<PROFILE_NAME>/ \n\nThe file extension will usually be *.dmp, but on some versions of AIX and Linux, the file may simply be named core. The process id and the date stamp are normally appended to the name of the file. \n\n\n\n\nProcessing the Dump \n\nExecute the jextract command on the same system and installation of WebSphere Application Server that the core dump was produced on. If you don't use the full path on AIX or Linux, make sure to use ./jextract (including the dot-slash) so the correct executable is picked up. \n\nReplace [COREDUMP_PATH] with the full path plus filename of the core dump produced. \n\n \n\nIf you do not know if compressed references is enabled, scroll to the FAQ section for a brief explanation. \n\n \n\nDetermining the Java Directory \n\nBecause different profiles on WebSphere Application Server 8.5.5.X and later can use different SDKs, the java directory inside the installation folder can differ. To determine the path, check the process list for the application server process and see which folder the java executable is being launched from. \n\n \n\nNOTE: If you are on WebSphere Liberty and are using an IBM SDK, the entire path to that SDK will differ. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n32-bit JVM and\n64-bit JVM with Compressed References disabled\nAIX/Linux: \n<WAS_HOME>/<JAVA_DIR>/jre/bin/jextract [COREDUMP_PATH]\n\nWindows: \n<WAS_HOME>\\<JAVA_DIR>\\jre\\bin\\jextract.exe [COREDUMP_PATH]\n\n\n\n\n64-bit JVM with Compressed References enabled\nDoes not apply to WebSphere Application Server 6.1\nAIX/Linux: \n<WAS_HOME>/<JAVA_DIR>/jre/bin/jextract -J-Xcompressedrefs [COREDUMP_PATH]\n\nWindows: \n<WAS_HOME>\\<JAVA_DIR>\\jre\\bin\\jextract.exe -J-Xcompressedrefs [COREDUMP_PATH] \n\n \n\n\n\n\nMax Heap Size \n\nTo adjust the max heap size, you can add -J-Xmx to adjust the size. For example, -J-Xmx1024m allows for a max heap size of 1024 MB when jextract is run. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nFiles Generated \n\nThe output will determine where the compressed data is stored (usually a .zip extension, .sdff is seen on older environments). Check the location of the core dump as that will be the most common location. \n\nCore files are usually compressible since a lot of data is zero; 10x compression can be expected in the resulting zip file \n\n \n\nIf you find XML files in the output directory, this may mean jextract failed, as these files are supposed to be placed automatically within the SDFF or ZIP file. \n\n \n\n\n\n\nError Messages \n\nEyeCatcher Error\nUnable to find J9VMRAS eyecatcher\nError. Internal failure detected during jextract \n\nThis error message indicates that jextract failed to identify the dump. This could be due to a number of things, including \n\n* The dump was not produced by WebSphere Application Server\n* The dump was produced from a native library or component such as a JNI component or database driver.\n* (AIX only) The dump generated is in an incompatible dump format due to an AIX OS issue (see APAR IZ88097 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ88097] for more details). \n\n \n\nOut of Memory Error \n\nSometimes the core dump is much larger than the default heap size can manage, and the recommendation is to increase the heap size using the -J-Xmx option. \n\n \n\n\n\n\nFAQ \n\nHow do I determine if compressed references is enabled? \n\nCompressed references were first introduced in 64-bit builds of IBM SDK 6.0. If WebSphere Application Server is at version 7.0.0.3 or higher, it will be enabled by default; see APAR PK75174 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK75174]. \n\nChecking the JVM arguments in the admin console can verify if compressed references was enabled manually. However, it's best to check the ps output or the javacore for the argument -Xcompressedrefs \n\nIf you find the argument -Xnocompressedrefs has been added, this means it's disabled (see page 7 of this document [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf] for more info)) \n\n \n\nWhat happens to jextract if I cannot determine if compressed references was enabled? \n\nIf you run jextract and did not realize compressed references was enabled, the output will ask you to rerun jextract and add the following argument: -J-Xcompressedrefs \n\n\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n MustGather: Crash on AIX [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21055387]\nMustGather: Crash on Linux [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21104706]\nMustGather: Crash on Windows [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21053924]\nGenerating Userdumps on Windows [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21138203]\nCrash on AIX produces no core or a truncated core [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21052642]\nCrash on Linux produces no core or a truncated core [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21115658]", "document_id": "swg21577379", "all_doc_ids": ["swg21577379", "swg21055387", "swg21273291", "swg21053924", "nas8N1013545", "swg21222653", "swg21104706", "swg1IV27936", "swg21255223", "swg21572522", "swg21222654", "swg21246238", "swg21222650", "swg22015892", "swg21222657", "swg21222490", "isg3T1022708", "swg21222464", "swg21501278", "swg1IV25299", "nas8N1020536", "swg21626849", "swg21405362", "swg21222484", "swg21222489", "swg21606943", "swg21388270", "swg21246239", "swg21222466", "swg21222651", "swg21673014", "swg21636414", "swg1IZ87782", "swg21222655", "swg21514752", "swg21253915", "swg21115785", "swg1IV34232", "swg21222656", "swg1IZ29217", "swg1IZ88090", "swg1IZ18005", "swg1IZ34556", "swg1IZ88097", "swg1IZ88091", "swg21676433", "swg1IZ48402", "swg22012976", "swg1IV09358", "swg21588007"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I receive the following during UDX compilation Can't exec \"/nz/kit/bin/adm/nzudxcompile\": Argument list too long", "id": "DEV_Q012", "answers": [{"answer_id": 28937406, "document_id": "swg21959723", "question_id": "DEV_Q012", "text": "This ARG_MAX kernel parameter adjusted to much larger from kernel release version 2.6.23, that is 2621440 (http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/argmax [http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/argmax]). \n\nBut we support upto Redhat 5.11 in Twinfin which is less than kernel release 2.6.23.

In that case, refer to technote Migrating to the latest version of Operational Decision Management [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21589725]. \n\nThat being said, make sure to consider migrating to the latest version or release ( V.R.M.F) of the product as soon as possible to benefit from the latest added features and improvements. \nANSWER\nAs with any software product, even if you do not have any issues with running your current configuration, you should apply the latest modification or fix pack to take advantage of these benefits: \n\n * Anticipate and avoid the risk of encountering defects already fixed. \n * Apply the latest product improvements that are available (performance, for example). \n * Maintain a serviceable system and be able to install an interim fix when required.\n\n\n\nWHEN TO UPDATE\nThe latest modification or fix pack should be installed as soon as it is available. \n\nYou can subscribe to the IBM Support My Notifications [https://www.ibm.com/support/mynotifications] to be notified of any fix pack releases, and you can also bookmark the Operational Decision Manager Download document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24031636] page, which lists the latest modifications or fix packs. \n\nSee the technote Fix pack release notification for Operational Decision Manager [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21665593] to find out when a modification or fix pack will be available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBEFORE UPDATING\n\n\nThe databases used in the sample server are deleted and recreated during the update. If you are using those databases and want to save the existing content, perform the following steps before updating: \n *  Stop the sample server. In the folder <ODM_HOME>/shared/data/derby, create an archive file containing the resdb and rtsdb folders. Save the archive file, such as zip file, in the data folder. After installation, unzip the archive file in the folder <ODM_HOME>/shared/data/derby to restore your databases before restarting the sample server. \n\n\n\nA new profile is also created for the sample server, at the first server start following the installation of a modification or fix pack. \n\nIf you want to continue using the same ports, you must delete the existing profile prior. In the <ODM_HOME>/shared/bin folder, from the command line, run the command ../tools/ant/bin/ant forcedestroyprofile. \n\n\nNote: The sample server is not designed to be used in a production system. For a production system, you must create a dedicated profile and database that you update using the following steps. \n\n\n\n\nUPDATING\n\n\nEach modification or fix pack page provides instructions on how to download and run the installer, in addition to providing a list of corrections that are included in the update. \n\nThe fix pack installation updates the following files and folders:  * JAR libraries in the installation directories, including <ODMInstallDir>\\<Module>\\lib. \n * EAR and WAR applications in the <ODMInstallDir>\\<Module>\\applicationservers\\<App Server> folders.\n\n\nOnce this is done, you perform these tasks:  * Repackage your client applications with the up-to-date libraries. \n * Reapply product customizations to the up-to-date Java EE modules (EARs and WARs).\n\n\n\nNote that all customizations you developed before the update, for example modifications of the descriptors, must be reapplied to the new, up-to-date EARs and WARs. It is a good idea to document and automate those customizations using scripts to make the process easier and error-proof. \n\nFinally, you must update the client applications and ODM modules on your server or servers with the same settings as you deployed previously. If you redeploy the application, follow again the documentation instructions to deploy all ODM modules to your servers [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r5m1/topic/com.ibm.odm.distrib.config/topics/odm_distrib_config.html]. \n\nKeep in mind that applying a modification or a fix pack does not require any data migration, so your projects and database remain the same. \n\nUPDATING RULE EXECUTION SERVER\n\n\nUpdate the following applications in the application server:  *  jrules-res-xu-<server>.rar jrules-res-management-<server>.ear jrules-ssp-<server>.ear jrules-res-htds-<server>ear \n\n\nMake sure you do not change the class loading policies for applications and modules ( parent last for all ODM modules). \n\nNote: Updating the eXecution Unit RAR file requires a restart of the server. \n\n\nUPDATE DECISION CENTER\n\n\nUpdate the following application in your application server: \n * jrules-teamserver-<server>.ear\n\n\nMake sure you do not change the class loading policies for applications and modules ( parent last for all ODM modules). \n\nUPDATE THE EVENTS RUNTIME\n\n 1. Stop the event runtime application, wberuntimeear. \n 2. Uninstall the following applications, if they exist:  * wbefileconnector \n     * wbehttpconnector \n     * wbejdbcconnector \n     * wbejmsconnector \n     * wbesoapconnector\n    \n    \n 3. Update the application wberuntimeear. \n 4. Start the application wberuntimeear.\n\n\nMake sure you do not change the class loading policies for applications and modules ( parent last for all ODM modules). \n\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS\n * Again, in addition to applying the latest modification or fix pack, consider migrating to the latest version or release (V.R.M.F) of the product as soon as possible to benefit from recently added features and improvements. See our technote Migrating to the latest version of Operational Decision Management [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21589725] for more information. \n * For JRules 7.1, you can refer to the JRules 7.1 list of fix packs [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27019787] and also Upgrading JRules to the latest V7.1 fix pack [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21474292] to learn how to apply the fix packs. But note that JRules 7.1 reaches end of support in September 2015 (see the IBM Support Lifecycle [http://www.ibm.com/software/websphere/support/lifecycle/] page). To ensure continued product support, plan an upgrade to the latest product version before that date.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Fix pack release notification for ODM [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21665593 ]\n\n\n \n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration WebSphere ILOG JRules Maintenance Platform Independent 7.1, 7.0", "document_id": "swg21665766", "all_doc_ids": ["swg24044043", "swg24039916", "swg24043530", "swg1RS02471", "swg21578211", "swg24037227", "swg24044042", "swg24037905", "swg24041821", "swg24043852", "swg24039235", "swg24039275", "swg24043671", "swg24040633", "swg24041321", "swg24035228", "swg24041725", "swg24042247", "swg24042348", "swg27046500", "swg21665766", "swg24039387", "swg24040019", "swg24034803", "swg21595620", "swg24044456", "swg21678244", "swg21980003", "swg1RS02629", "swg1RS01918", "swg21595346", "swg24044932", "swg21587707", "swg21694928", "swg24036507", "swg21646410", "swg21681168", "swg21975049", "swg21653691", "swg24031627", "swg21983535", "swg24043654", "swg27044404", "swg21999137", "swg1RS01769", "swg1RS01846", "swg27023697", "swg21684689", "swg22003737", "swg1RS02491"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I was using updateInstaller to install fixpacks, and there was a separate fixpack for WebSphere and separate for the JDK, independent of each other.

Applying fixpacks of WebSphere Application Server also upgrades the SDK that is packaged and bundled within the fixpack. Additionally, separate Java SDK fixpacks are also available that contain just the SDK updates which can be applied to upgrade the SDK.\n\nWebSphere Application Server V7.0\nAny V7.0 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.6.0 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\n\nWebSphere Application Server V6.1\nAny V6.1 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.5.0 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\n\nWebSphere Application Server V6.0\nAny V6.0 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.4.2 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\n\nWebSphere Application Server V5.1\nAny V5.1 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.4.1 and any V5.1.1 can be upgraded to the latest Java SDK 1.4.2 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\n\nWebSphere Application Server V5.0\nAny V5.0 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.3.1 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\n\n\n\nDetails of Java SDK Upgrade Policy\n\nWebSphere Application Server leverages the Java SDK as a base component. This results in unique support issues, including:\n\n\n * Matching Java SDK service releases to Application Server releases and fix packs\n   \n   \n * Delivering updates and fixes associated with the Java SDK on any given Application Server release.\n\n\nIn an effort to resolve customer Java SDK situations as quickly as possible, WebSphere Application Server Support has done a quickest-path-to-resolution analysis, determining the most direct way to collect problem information. \n\nIn some cases, problem resolution might include finding shortcuts to resolve symptoms. One shortcut is an immediate upgrade to a newer compatible Java SDK service release, before gathering detailed problem determination data. \n\nThere are multiple advantages to performing an immediate Java SDK upgrade as a quicker path to resolution over a full Problem Determination (PD) process: \n 1. There is a continuous stream of fixes going into the Java SDK. Many problems encountered by customers are resolved by these fixes.\n    \n    \n 2. When a new problem is encountered, applying the latest Java SDK is a quick way to determine if related fixes change the symptoms or correct the problem.\n    \n    \n 3. Many documented Java SDK fixes have common symptoms. Frequently, limited PD data does not isolate the problem to a single root cause.\n    \n\n\nThese factors highlight the advantage of applying a newer Java SDK before working through a full PD cycle. \n\nJava SDK and WebSphere Application Server software are updated frequently. To avoid compatibility issues for customers, WebSphere Application Server Support maintains this Java SDK Upgrade Policy. \n\nWebSphere Application Server Support details: \nhttp://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/support.html [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/support.html] \n\nIdentifying compatibility limitations between WebSphere Application Server releases and Java SDK service releases that have not been tested together reduces risk. \n\nImportant: Using a Java SDK not specifically packaged with WebSphere Application Server and supplied by IBM, or in violation of the Java SDK Upgrade Policy, is not supported by IBM WebSphere Application Server Support for Java SDK problems.

This is required in certain situations, such as, when EJB traffic is not being sent through the ODR and there is no need to load balance the EJB traffic, or EJB traffic is driven through the web artifacts like servlets and web service time is inclusive of EJB response time. \n\nLOCAL FIX: \nN/A \n\nPROBLEM SUMMARY\n\nUSERS AFFECTED:\nAll users of WebSphere Virtual Enterprise who are using dynamic clusters that have Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) and web applications\n\nPROBLEM DESCRIPTION:\nDynamic weights are not calculated correctly by dynamic workload management (DWLM) in certain situations.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nNone\n\nThe ability to disable the usage of EJB statistics when calculating dynamic weight for a dynamic cluster member should be supported. This support is required in certain situations, such as when EJB traffic is not sent through the ODR and there is no need for the load balancing of the EJB traffic. Another example of when this support is needed is when EJB traffic is driven through web artifacts.\n\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION: \nThe issue is fixed by setting the ignoreEJBStats custom property to true at the cell or dynamic cluster level. Setting the custom property at the cell level affects all the dynamic clusters in the cell, which must be recycled for the custom property changes to take effect. When the custom property is set to true, DWLM ignore EJB statistics during the weight calculation. The default value for the custom property is \nfalse. \n\nThis fix will be included in the next available fix pack for WebSphere Virtual Enterprise.\n\nPREREQUISITES\nPlease download the UpdateInstaller below to install this fix.\n\nURL LANGUAGE SIZE(Bytes) UpdateInstaller [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg24012718] US English 7250000 \nINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS\nPlease review the readme.txt for detailed installation instructions.\n\nURL LANGUAGE SIZE(Bytes) Readme [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/websphere/extended/support/fixes/PM37444/readme.txt] US English 5364 \nDOWNLOAD PACKAGE\n\n\nDownload RELEASE DATE LANGUAGE SIZE(Bytes) Download Options \nWhat is Fix Central(FC)?

So the first two set of information above should be visible, while the FINEST level should require specific configuration of the Java logging to be visible. \n\nInstructions \n\nBundle the attached jrules-debugtrace.jar sample in the Rule Execution Server (RES) application that is performing ruleset executions:  * If you are using JRules Hosted Transparent Decision Service (HTDS), in jrules-res-htds-<appserver>.ear/jrules-res-htds-<appserver>.war/WEB-INF/lib \n * If you are using JRules Scenario Service Provider (SSP) in jrules-ssp-<appserver>.ear/jrules-ssp-server.war/WEB-INF/lib \n * If you are executing rules from your application, the sample should be packaged alongside the RES session library that your application already bundles \n\n\n\njrules-debugtrace.jar [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21433278&aid=2]jrules-debugtrace.jar [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21433278&aid=1] \nIf you are interested in learning about the implementation of this DW trace you can use the following eclipse project : \n\njrules-debugtrace-src.zip [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21433278&aid=4]jrules-debugtrace-src.zip [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21433278&aid=3] \nRELATED INFORMATION\n#A simplified Chinese translation is available [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21665639]\n\n\n \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration IBM Operational Decision Manager Platform Independent 8.5, 8.0.1, 8.0, 7.5 Enterprise", "document_id": "swg21433278", "all_doc_ids": ["swg21586717", "swg21440000", "swg21433278", "swg21627010", "swg1RS01921", "swg21589513", "swg21588859", "swg21452630", "swg21617737", "swg21667599", "swg21621350", "swg21427266", "swg21989261", "swg21449110", "swg21606315", "swg21989288", "nas8N1019479", "swg21989269", "swg21645364", "swg21433167", "swg1RS02810", "swg21430461", "swg21610908", "swg1RS00286", "swg21325206", "swg1PK20880", "swg21623705", "swg21259454", "swg21514921", "swg21458646", "swg21433790", "swg21343375", "swg21469115", "swg21650642", "swg21625067", "swg1RS00171", "swg21418646", "swg21632451", "swg21632563", "swg21499389", "swg21239790", "swg1IZ01052", "swg21971007", "swg21278395", "swg21420794", "swg1JR55746", "swg21584855", "swg21609184", "swg21256825", "swg21419162"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I upgraded to WMQ 7.5.0.x client and now my .NET application fails to connect to the QMgr.

The pubsub broker\n   attempts to put a message to a queue and fails with:\n   AMQ5855: WebSphere MQ Publish/Subscribe broker ended.\n   EXPLANATION: An attempt has been made to run the broker (AAA)\n   but the broker has ended for reason\n   '6047:xecX_E_CONV_NOT_SUP'.\n   An attempt is then made to end the queue manager normally\n   using endmqm and it hangs.\n   NOTE:\n   This only occurs on WMQ 7.0 for HP-UX.\n   ADDITIONAL KEYWORDS:\n   Publish Subscribe hung quiesce immediate shut down shutdown\n   SYSTEM.BROKER.INTER.BROKER.COMMUNICATIONS\n   conversion not supported code page 6047 xecX_E_CONV_NOT_SUP\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nLOCAL FIX\n *  - do not set qmgr to use invalid CCSID\n   or\n   - use endmqm -i\n   or\n   - disable PSMODE:  ALTER QMGR PSMODE(DISABLED)\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nPROBLEM SUMMARY\n *  ****************************************************************\n   USERS AFFECTED:\n   Users who create a V7 queue manager with one queue manager\n   CCSID, and then change the queue manager to a CCSID where\n   conversion between the two CCSID's is not supported.\n   \n   Platforms affected:\n   HP-UX (Itanium),HP-UX (PA-RISC)\n   \n   ****************************************************************\n   PROBLEM SUMMARY:\n   The queue manager stores configuration information for the\n   broker on queues. The multi-broker sub-component of the broker\n   expects to receive messages both from the local queue manager,\n   and from remote queue managers, and gets messages with\n   MQGMO_CONVERT. This sub-component was incorrectly putting\n   messages on system queues in queue manager CCSID, and then\n   subsequently getting those messages in queue manager CCSID\n   (with MQGMO_CONVERT). If the queue manager CCSID is changed\n   such that conversion between the old CCSID and the new CCSID is\n   not supported then the MQGET fails and the amqfqpub process\n   fails to initialize.\n   \n   A secondary problem also exists where the abnormal termination\n   of the amqfqpub process hangs. This occurs because not all\n   threads of the process are being signalled to terminate.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\n *  The broker no longer stores state messages that might need to\n   be converted in queue manager CCSID. Rather the broker chooses\n   a 'native' CCSID for the platform upon which it is running and\n   all messages are created and consumed in that explicit CCSID.\n   \n   The routine that handles abnormal termination of the amqfqpub\n   process has been connected such that all threads in the process\n   are signalled that the process is ending abnormally.\n   \n   Note: although the problem could theoretically occur on all\n   distributed platforms, in practice the problem is only ever\n   likely to be seen on HP-UX.\n   \n   ---------------------------------------------------------------\n   The fix is targeted for delivery in the following PTFs:\n   \n                      v7.0\n   Platform           Fix Pack 7.0.1.2\n   --------           --------------------\n   HP-UX (PA-RISC)    U829678\n   HP-UX (Itanium)    U829681\n   \n   The latest available maintenance can be obtained from\n   'WebSphere MQ Recommended Fixes'\n   http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006037 [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006037]\n   \n   If the maintenance level is not yet available, information on\n   its planned availability can be found in 'WebSphere MQ\n   Planned Maintenance Release Dates'\n   http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006309 [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006309]\n   ---------------------------------------------------------------\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nTEMPORARY FIX\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nAPAR INFORMATION\n * APAR NUMBER\n   IZ63038\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT NAME\n   WMQ HP V7\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT ID\n   5724H7222\n   \n   \n * REPORTED RELEASE\n   700\n   \n   \n * STATUS\n   CLOSED PER\n   \n   \n * PE\n   NoPE\n   \n   \n * HIPER\n   NoHIPER\n   \n   \n * SPECIAL ATTENTION\n   NoSpecatt\n   \n   \n * SUBMITTED DATE\n   2009-10-14\n   \n   \n * CLOSED DATE\n   2010-01-19\n   \n   \n * LAST MODIFIED DATE\n   2010-01-20\n   \n   \n\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED FROM ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n * APAR IS SYSROUTED TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n\nFIX INFORMATION\n * FIXED COMPONENT NAME\n   WMQ HP V7\n   \n   \n * FIXED COMPONENT ID\n   5724H7222\n   \n   \n\nAPPLICABLE COMPONENT LEVELS\n * R700 PSY\n   UP", "document_id": "swg1IZ63038", "all_doc_ids": ["swg1SE46234", "swg1IZ92715", "swg1IT01265", "swg21179308", "swg21243196", "swg1IZ67359", "swg1PI81371", "swg1IC59979", "swg1PI76997", "swg1PI81419", "swg1PM37003", "swg1PM36658", "swg1PM76645", "swg1PI45157", "nas8N1017425", "swg1PM29615", "swg1PM24866", "swg21233177", "swg1IV02028", "swg1PK76501", "swg21222078", "swg1IY45552", "swg1PK08495", "swg1PM61807", "swg21320347", "swg1PM59982", "swg21173813", "swg1PM58916", "swg21430080", "swg1IT19539", "swg1IV08393", "swg21212795", "swg1IV18358", "swg21235552", "swg1IT17154", "swg1PK86431", "swg1IZ63038", "swg21109867", "swg1PI65866", "swg1SE60211", "swg1IC67868", "swg1PM09629", "swg1IV49971", "swg21566441", "swg1IZ28106", "swg1PI08166", "swg21176955", "swg1PK71771", "swg27021866", "swg1PM26211"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How can I import a certificate in ITCAM for Data Power?", "id": "DEV_Q025", "answers": [{"answer_id": 56803797, "document_id": "swg21959588", "question_id": "DEV_Q025", "text": "Import the certification file into the agent by doing the following command:\n\nNote : You can use either .cer or .pem. \nMake sure the file is in ASCII not binary. \nWhere the /usr/ITM/JRE is your Java location and <fileName> is your file name.", "answer_start": 645, "answer_end": 886, "answer_category": null}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "CAMDPALL CAMDPSEC Certification Import Importing TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nTHIS DOCUMENT APPLIES ONLY TO THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE VERSION(S):\n US English \n\nQUESTION\n How to import a Certificate for the TCAM Agent for Data Power (BN Agent) ?

For example: \n\n * The first user accessing a RTS / DC server that remained idle overnight experiences a failure upon logging and the server log shows an com.ibm.websphere.ce.cm.StaleConnectionException occurred at that time. \n * After a RES server has been processing execution requests normally for some time, an attempt to deploy a ruleset update fails and the server log shows an com.ibm.websphere.ce.cm.StaleConnectionException occurred upon an attempt to invalidate a ruleset or to retrieve its definition.\n\n\nCAUSE\nThe underlying network connection for a data source is no longer valid although the data source itself remains considered active from the WebSphere Application Server data source connection pool management perspective. An attempt by a JRules module to try and access its data base through one such data source connection provided by the Application Server may then fail. \nThe network connection of a data source may become invalid for a number of reasons, one typical example is that a firewall between the Application Server and the Database has a policy to discard network connections that remain idle for some time.\n\n\nENVIRONMENT\nThe exception com.ibm.websphere.ce.cm.StaleConnectionException is specific to WebSphere Application Server environments. But a similar issue can be experienced with Weblogic, see: Rule Execution Server on WebLogic unable to load ruleset after period of inactivity [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21615801]\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nConfigure the WebSphere Application Server data source connection pool [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/udat_conpoolset.html] so as to eliminate occurrences of StaleConnectionException : \n\n * Set the Minimum connections to 0 to avoid situations where a connection is kept in the pool to meet the minimum requirement, even though it may have been idle for longer than Unused timeout \n * Set the values for Unused timeout and Reap timeout so that the sum does not exceed any network level idle connection timeout\n\n\nThe document Troubleshooting stale connection problems [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21247168#SCETroubleshooting] provides further information.

This can be very helpful when a debug log level is needed to help isolate a problem or monitor behavior over a long period of time or can be used in production environment as DataPower only keeps a limited number of log files (the default is 3 files) in the file system in a rotational basis. \n\nCAUSE\nThe DataPower device has a finite amount of space to hold larger than average log files or long term logging needs in production environment. \n\nIt should be noted that if used while debugging at load or in a capacity issue, log events may be dropped. There is a prioritization of events within the device and client traffic always comes first. Log events dropped can be confirmed or counted from the Status>Log Targets menu in the WebGUI.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nConfigure a server daemon to listen and capture the DataPower devices events. First, this example shows how to create the log target sending events to a syslog destination. The other examples listed below will have their own strong points to be considered depending on the problem scenario. \n\n \n\nSyslog: \n\n* The syslog protocol operates over UDP which has no guarantee on packet delivery - a fast fire and forget method. \n\nTo create the new log target, go into the default domain: Objects > Log Targets \n\nConfigure the log target with settings as follows from the WebGUI: \n\n 1. Name the log target \n 2. Select Target Type of syslog \n 3. Fill in the Local Identifier with a descriptive string that may be used by a remote recipient to identify this specific log target \n 4. Enter the Remote Host Address and the Remote IP Port as in the screen shot wherex.x.x.x is the IP address of the remote syslog server that listens on port 514 \n 5. Take all other defaults\n\n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=1]  \n\n \n\nUnder the Event Subscriptions tab, you can select all and debug as indicated here: \n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=2] \n\n * \n * 6. Generate log events in the DataPower by using some transactions, for example by saving the configuration from the WebGUI or running some test load into a domain.\n\n\nSyslog-ng, will simply work over the TCP protocol to ensure the packet is delivered to the destination. The same consideration should be applied to a device under high load in that a log event could be dropped if not able to be wrote out to the network within time. \n\n \n\nNFS:\nAll NFS limitations apply from file size and permission settings. This is a more common approach using an NFS static mount to capture a log target and can allow for slightly more reliable messages to be logged. The limiting factor again is the speed of the network and NFS server response time. \n\n \n\nFile type: \n\nUsing a file type log target with a backup method as seen here:\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=3]\nThis will allow log events to quickly be written to a local file on the device's file system. Once the file reaches its set size a connection to the destination will upload the file from the device. This will upload with a unique time and date stamp on the uploaded file.\n\nThis is a useful method to capture sporadic problems. This is also useful for long running transactions that may span more than one file depending on device load.\n\n\nHTTP service:\nFinally a clever method that may be used in some senarios would be an HTTP service on the device.\nUsing an HTTP service configured in the following way,\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=4] \n\nOnce the file type log is created in the logtemp:/// directory, a client browser or wget type client can easily retrieve the file from the device. \n\nThis is very useful when there is no local or accessible remote log storage location to the device, due to firewall or network restrictions. \n\nThis is also removing the limitation of the device dropping the log event should it not be able to write the log event to the network. \n\nEach of the above methods are very useful and work better in some scenarios than others depending on the network, load, problem, and information needed. This is intended to be a guide to help you decide which method would be best for your scenario.", "document_id": "swg21269136", "all_doc_ids": ["swg21269136", "swg21502873", "swg21651652", "swg27041346", "swg21622313", "swg21987398", "swg21991090", "swg21447824", "swg21674902", "swg21454483", "swg1IT19589", "swg21692741", "swg1IT24941", "swg1IT07482", "swg21656015", "swg21983696", "swg21690475", "swg21672049", "nas8N1019020", "swg21181819", "swg21499749", "swg21469404", "swg1PK54211", "nas8N1015947", "swg21002802", "swg21585229", "swg21325717", "swg21646168", "swg21960879", "swg21626359", "swg21250655", "swg1LI72409", "swg1PK87788", "swg1LI72641", "isg3T1014070", "swg1IT19683", "swg21329071", "swg1IY75719", "swg21690785", "swg27018800", "swg21655077", "swg1IV55299", "nas8N1011740", "swg21419092", "swg1IJ00987", "swg21694047", "swg1IV13181", "swg24044502", "swg1PN91092", "isg3T1013865"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "\n\nHi,\n\nWe noticed that a was application server uses 1,4 Go of memory at startup, we would like to understand what java classes are using most part of it.\n\nIs a Java profiler provided by default with WAS 8.0 ?

Then DB2 can perform TSM related functions appropriately. The common practice is to set these TSM related environment variables in the DB2 instance's .profile or even in the DB2 instance's userprofile file. When DB2 gets started as the instance owner, the database will have all the required environment variables properly set. \n\nOn a Tivoli Directory Server system, the ldap server (ibmslapd) stores all its data into its own backend DB2 database on the same system. When using the default ldap ports (389 and 636), ibmslapd must be started as the root user. During the start of ibmslapd, ibmslapd also starts the associated DB2 instance. If DB2 is already started, ibmslapd will just proceed. \n\nIf ibmslapd is started by the root user then neither the instance's profile nor the userprofile files are sourced into ibmslapd. In turn if DB2 also gets started during this step by ibmslapd, the required TSM related environment variables will not be set into DB2. This causes issues with DB2 (in TDS system) being aware of TSM.\n\n\nANSWER\nUse one of the following methods to start ibmslapd appropriately and have the DB2 acquire the required environment variables from the .profile or userprofile files. \n\nMake sure the required environment variables are appropriately exported from the .profile OR userprofile files. \n\nExample for setting environment variables (for ksh / bash):\nexport DSMI_CONFIG=/usr/tivoli/tsm/client/api/bin64/dsm.opt\nexport DSMI_DIR=/usr/tivoli/tsm/client/api/bin64\nexport DSMI_LOG=/home/instance/tsmlog/\n\nprofile file locations:\n.profile is located in the home folder of the instance.\ndb2profile is located in the sqllib folder inside home folder of the instance.\nidsprofile is located in the folder <Location>/idsslapd-<Name>/, where \"idsilist -a\" shows the <Location> and <Name> values of the instance.\nuserprofile file for DB2 is located in the sqllib folder inside home folder of the instance.\nuserprofile file for TDS is located in the folder <Location>/idsslapd-<Name>/.\n\nIts recommended to update either .profile file or userprofile file of DB2/TDS only with environment variables. Do not update either db2profile or idsprofile files. \n\nMethod 1: Source instance's .profile OR just the idsprofile and db2profile files into the root's shell before starting up ibmslapd.

If a transactional operation performed by RTS/DC takes longer than these timeouts to complete, the transaction is rolled back and the operation is not completed.\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nIf you perform time consuming operations in large repositories, you can increase the timeout value in the web.xml file of the RTS/DC EAR file (jrules-teamserver-<appserver>.ear\\teamserver.war\\WEB-INF) by changing the value of the property ilog.rules.teamserver.transaction.timeout. \n\n\nYou will find the property in the file web.xml defined as below:\n...\n<context-param>\n<description>Modify the timeout value that is associated with transactions (in seconds)</description>\n<param-name>ilog.rules.teamserver.transaction.timeout</param-name>\n<param-value>600</param-value>\n</context-param> \n... \n\nAnother place to look for are application server specific transaction timeout configurations. For example, for WebSphere Application Server, check the \"Maximum transaction timeout\" and increase it as needed as described here [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tjta_settlog.html].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration IBM Operational Decision Manager Platform Independent 7.5 Enterprise Business Integration IBM Operational Decision Manager Platform Independent 8.0.1, 8.0 Enterprise", "document_id": "swg21451229", "all_doc_ids": ["swg21451229", "swg21653948", "swg1IV38021", "swg21426266", "swg21994238", "swg21580847", "swg21439561", "swg1IZ78507", "swg21970072", "swg21516072", "swg1RS02344", "swg21961137", "swg21644878", "swg21997141", "swg21545260", "swg21408905", "swg1IY68026", "swg21415491", "swg21512329", "swg21147129", "swg21963674", "swg1HD59502", "swg21458414", "swg21976199", "swg1IY86784", "swg21293213", "swg22010714", "swg27020512", "swg21428407", "swg21508727", "swg21512248", "swg21224029", "swg21427869", "swg21512490", "swg21621492", "swg21615100", "swg21637207", "swg21295449", "nas8N1021384", "swg21253578", "swg1IZ18089", "swg21322947", "swg21078845", "swg21438374", "swg21633692", "swg21240176", "swg21444816", "swg1JR31783", "swg21643735", "swg21639027"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "When attempting to upgrade my Virtual DataPower Appliance from 5.0.0.8 firmware version to 6.0+ firmware versions, I receive a failure message.

That will enable the Plug-in to be able to locate the appropriate GSKit libraries and be able to initialize SSL transports. \n\n\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n#Web server plug-in setupGSKitLibPath script contains in [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21441018]", "document_id": "swg21600618", "all_doc_ids": ["swg21600618", "swg1PI76789", "swg21660794", "nas8N1019946", "swg21316538", "swg21448961", "swg21628233", "swg1PK74014", "swg21177702", "swg21441018", "swg21326077", "swg21600845", "swg22006500", "swg21237873", "swg1PI64162", "swg1PM43462", "swg21160581", "swg21587950", "swg22006218", "swg21211601", "swg21433593", "swg21683644", "swg21382900", "swg1PK92310", "swg1PM15347", "swg21104930", "swg21648276", "swg21420624", "swg21316308", "swg21486213", "swg21449249", "swg21264477", "swg21165469", "swg21980689", "swg1PK12168", "isg3T1024202", "swg21442118", "swg21636467", "swg21883978", "swg22003061", "swg1PK50906", "swg1PM72629", "swg1PM90963", "swg21253131", "swg21141302", "swg1PM74603", "swg21260208", "swg21588390", "swg21328944", "swg21592917"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Has ITCAM for J2EE 7.1.1 IF4 been released?

The following information presents some options for formulating an approach that best fits your environment.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nFirst, know your certificate material. It's not uncommon for newer certificates to be chained, so it is not a one for one replacement; the existing certificate on the DataPower appliance may need to be replaced by more than one certificate. Therefore, it is important to ensure you have the full certificate chain, as appropriate (i.e, the personal, intermediate and root certificates). Certificate authorities may send two certificates in the chain and expect the third one to be downloaded from their website. \n\n\nHere's a screenshot of a sample chain. Notice that you can check the 'Certification Path' tab if there are any remaining certificates in the chain. Also note the chain of \"Issued To\" and \"Issued By\" identities.\nExampleCertificateChain.jpg [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=2]ExampleCertificateChain.jpg [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=1]\n\n\nAs for the certificate configuration on DataPower, the appliance will reference the actual key and certificate files stored in the cert: directory by file name. Navigation in the WebGUI to the SSL Proxy Profile -> Crypto Profile -> Crypto Key and Certificate objects will show the current files referenced by the configuration.\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=3]\n\n\nFor example, your DataPower configuration may currently reference the existing files cert:///current-key.pem and cert:///current-cert.pem.\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=4]\n\nAs long as the replacement file(s) are NOT named the same as these files (i.e. the new ones are named cert:///new-key.pemand cert:///new-cert.pem for example), it is safe to load the new file(s) into the cert: directory at any time ahead of the replacement operation. Your existing configuration will not use the new files, so long as the Crypto Key and Certificate Objects still refer to the files associated with the expiring certificate (i.e. cert:///current-key.pem and cert:///current-cert.pem). \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=5]\n\nHaving both expiring and replacement files in the cert: directory at once allows for the capability to modify the configuration to point to the new files or revert it back to the expiring files relatively easily or to configure a new SSL Proxy Profile object that references the new files. The new SSL Proxy Profile could be used to test independently of the currently running configuration using a new test service such as an XML Firewall. \n\nYou can navigate directly to the key and certificate objects using these paths: \nObjects \u2192 Crypto Configuration \u2192 Crypto Certificate.\nObjects \u2192 Crypto Configuration \u2192 Crypto Key \n\nAnother view is from Control Panel -> Keys and Certificate Management.\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=6] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=6]\n\nEither way, note how the configuration ultimately references the files in the cert: directory and plan ahead for how you prefer to reference the new files. \n\nThey may be swapped out within the existing Crypto Configuration objects (i.e. update the objects to reference the new file(s) or to revert to the expiring ones as needed). \n\nAlternatively, a new separate set of Crypto Configuration objects that reference the new files may be created and replacement performed at the Crypto object level by updating the configuration to reference the new replacement Crypto Configuration objects.\n\nImportant Note: If the replacement certificate has the same file name of the expired certificate, you MUST disable/enable the certificate object in order to clear all cached references to the expired certificate.\n\nFor more information on certificates, refer to the product documentation specific to your firmware and appliance type.

Please verify the codepoints for non-ASCII characters that you try to insert. If you see only 1 byte per non-ASCII characters then you need to force the database conversion during insert from CLP to UTF-8 database. \n\nTo force codepage conversion during insert from the CLP make sure that the operating system codepage is non-Unicode and matching to the codepage of data when you insert data to Unicode database from non-Unicode data source. \n\nProblem Details\nAn example problem scenario is as follows:\n\n\n 1.  Create a database of type UTF-8:\n     \n     CREATE DATABASE <db> USING CODESET utf-8 TERRITORY US \n     \n     \n 2.  Create a table that holds character data:\n     \n     CREATE TABLE test (col char(20)) \n     \n     \n 3.  Check operating system locale:\n     \n     locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8 \n     LC_CTYPE=\"en_US.UTF-8\" \n     \n     \n 4.  Insert the non-ASCII characters '\u00c3' , '\u00b3', '\u00a9' which have codepoint 0x'C3', 0x'B3',0x'A9' in codepage 819 into the table:\n     \n     INSERT INTO test VALUES ('\u00c3')\n     INSERT INTO test VALUES ('\u00b3')\n     INSERT INTO test VALUES ('\u00a9') \n     \n     \n 5.  By running the following statement, you can see that all INSERT statements caused only one byte to be inserted into the table:\n     \n     SELECT col, HEX(col) FROM test\n     \n     \n     \u00c3 C3\n     \u00b3 B3\n     \u00a9 A9\n     \n     However, the UTF-8 representation of those characters are: 0x'C383' for '\u00c3', 0x'C2B3' for '\u00b3', and 0x'C2A9' for '\u00a9'.\n     So these three rows in the table contain invalid characters in UTF-8. \n     \n     \n 6.  When selecting from a column using the JDBC application, the following error will occur. This is expected because the table contains invalid UTF-8 data:\n     Error executing Select SQL statement. Caught by java.io.CharConversionException.

Delete all rows with incorrect Unicode codepoints from the test table:\n     DELETE * from test \n     \n     \n 8.  Change the locale to one that matching codepage of data to be inserted:\n     export locale=en_us. One of the way to determine the codepage for your data can be found here: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/17201/Detect-Encoding-for-In-and-Outgoing-Text [http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/17201/Detect-Encoding-for-In-and-Outgoing-Text]. If you prepare data yourself using some editor please check the documentation for your editor to find out how to set up the codepage for data being prepared by the editor. \n     \n     \n 9.  Insert data to the table:\n     INSERT INTO test VALUES ('\u00c3')\n     INSERT INTO test VALUES ('\u00b3')\n     INSERT INTO test VALUES ('\u00a9') \n     \n     \n 10. Verify that inserted data were converted to UTF-8 during insert:\n     SELECT col, HEX(col) FROM test\n     \n     \n     \u00c3 C383\n     \u00b3 C2B3\n     \u00a9 C2A9 \n     \n     \n 11.

These domains can be used to provide customized security settings for applications and service integration buses. A Security Domain has a scope that defines where its settings are applicable. Settings that are not defined in the domain default to the global security settings.\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nCheck the security domain listed IBM WebSphere Application Server and its association. \n\n * Security->Security Domains \n * Open security domain and check if it is associated with IBM Content Navigator Node or Cluster.\n   \n   \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nA Security Domain can be scoped to an entire cell, or to a specific set of servers, clusters, or service integration buses. Therefore, multiple security domains can be used to allow security settings to vary from one application to another application. Security settings that apply to an application will be defined by the following scope: \n\n\n1. If the application is running on a server or cluster that is within the scope of a security domain, those settings will be used. Security settings that are not defined in this domain will be taken from the global security settings (not a cell-level domain).\n\n2. If the application is running on a server or cluster that is not within the scope of a security domain, but a security domain has been defined at the cell scope, that domain will be used.

For example, DFHAP0001 An abend (code 0C4/AKEA) has occurred at offset X'FFFFFFFF' in module DFHAMP. The X'FFFFFFFF' indicates that CICS was unable to establish the location of the program check. So, you would like to locate the PSW and registers in your CICS system dump. \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nIf you have a system dump from a CICS TS V4.1 region, see locating the PSW for a program check in a CICS TS 4.1 system dump [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21424768]. \nIf you have a system dump from a CICS TS V3.2 or lower region, see locating the PSW for a program check in a CICS TS V3 system dump [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21176381].\n\nIf you have a system dump that contains your CICS TS V4.2, CICS TS V5.1, CICS TS V5.2, or CICS TS V5.3 address space, you can do the following to locate the PSW and the registers for the program check: \n\n 1.  Enter option 0 from the IPCS primary option menu to display the IPCS default values panel.\n 2.  \n 3.  \n 4.  Enter DSNAME('xxxxx.xxxxx.xxxx') to the right of Source where xxxxx.xxxxx.xxxx is the dump dataset name. Then enter Enter and F3 to return to the IPCS primary option menu.\n 5.  \n 6.  \n 7.  Enter option 6 from the IPCS primary option menu to display the IPCS Subcommand Entry panel.\n 8.  \n 9.  \n 10. Enter IPCS command verbx dfhpdxxx 'ke' where xxx is the version and release for the CICS dump. The value of xxx is 670 for CICS TS V4.2, 680 for CICS TS V5.1, 690 for CICS TS V5.2, and 700 for CICS TS V5.3. This command will format the dump and display to the Kernel Domain KE_TASK Summary.\n 11. \n 12. \n 13. Enter f *YES* to get to the running task that had the program check. There may be more than one. In the example below, there is one task with *YES* under ERROR (KE_NUM 0157). Figure 1.1 \n     [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21610631&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21610631&aid=1]\n     \n     \n 14. \n 15. Make a note of the KE_NUM, TCA_ADDR and the TRANSID of the tasks in error.\n 16. \n 17. \n 18. Enter f table to find the KE Domain Error Table Summary. This is a summary containing the last 50 abends in the region since it was started. Figure 1.2\n     [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21610631&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21610631&aid=2]\n     \n     \n     \n 19. \n 20. Enter ip st sys on the command line to determine the local time and date that the dump was taken.\n 21. \n 22. \n 23. Make a note of the ERR_NUM associated with the program check that has an ERR_TIME matching the time the dump was taken and a KE_NUM matching the KE_NUM found in the Kernel Domain KE_TASK Summary. If there is more than one program check for the same ERR_TIME and KE_NUM, focus on the first program check. The other program checks are probably a result of the first program check.\n 24. \n 25. \n 26. Enter f 'Number: xxxxxxxx' where xxxxxxxx is the ERR_NUM of the program check (from Figure 1.2) you have decided to focus on. This will find the entry in the KE Domain Error table for the error number you specify.\n     \n     Figure 1.3\n     [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21610631&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21610631&aid=3]\n     \n 27. \n 28. \n 29. For CICS TS V4.2 or V5.x compare the addresses at offset X'4C' and offset X'134' in the KERNEL ERROR DATA. The addresses are the fourth word of the CICS PSW and the MVS PSW, respectively. If the addresses are different, use the MVS PSW and registers. Otherwise, use the CICS PSW and registers.\n     \n     The CICS PSW starts at offset x'40' and is 4 words in length. The CICS registers, 0 through 15, start at offset X'68' and each register is 2 words in length. \n     \n     The MVS PSW starts at offset x'128' and is 4 words in length. The MVS registers, 0 through 15, start at offset x'150' and each register is 2 words in length.\n 30. \n 31. Use F8 to scroll down to see the formatted CICS PSW and registers as shown in Figure 1.4 below. IPCS CICS VERBX will format the MVS PSW and registers if the MVS PSW is different from the CICS PSW. If the PSWs are the same as in this example, then CICS VERBX does not duplicate the information.\n     \n     Figure 1.4\n     [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21610631&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21610631&aid=4]\n     \n     CICS VERBX will attempt to determine the failing module from the PSW and will display the module name and offset if possible. The offline dump formatter uses more information than the original failure message, and so often, when the original failure message is unhelpful (offset FFFFFFFF in module) the dump formatter will be more informative. \n     \n     By scrolling down from the panel in Figure 1.4, you will often get the failing module printed from the start to the interrupt address plus 256 bytes. CICS VERBX will also assume the values in the general registers are addresses and print the storage before and after these addresses, using 64 bit, 31 bit, and 24 bit addresses.\n\n\n\nOnce you know the PSW, you can do the following to determine the module that the failure is occurring in:  1.  Enter option 1 from the IPCS primary option menu to Browse the dump data set.\n 2.  \n 3.  \n 4.  Enter nnnnnnnn into the Pointer Address field where nnnnnnnn is the fourth word of the PSW. \n 5.  \n 6.  \n 7.  If the storage displays, enter F7 to scroll up until you see an eye catcher for a load module. Load module names are usually followed by a date and time stamp. Calculate an offset within the module by subtracting the load point from the PSW address. This is the offset where the abend occurred.\n 8.  \n 9.  \n 10. If \"storage not available\" displays, enter ip where nnnnnnnn. If the module has been loaded by the operating system from the LPA or Nucleus, this will display the module name and the offset within the module.\n\n\n\nNow that you know the module name and the offset, search for a known problem on the CICS Support page [http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/Overview/Software/Other_Software/CICS_Transaction_Server] or from your favorite search engine. Use keywords such as the following for a search argument: 'DFHAP0001 DFHAPDM 0C4'.  \n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n CICS/TS CICS TS CICS Transaction Server", "document_id": "swg21610631", "all_doc_ids": ["swg21110889", "swg21243115", "swg21049790", "swg21267440", "swg21426821", "swg21039797", "swg21272740", "swg21259595", "swg21260084", "swg21567176", "swg21195285", "swg1PK59523", "swg21079336", "swg1PI54434", "swg21642693", "swg1PI56624", "swg21213007", "swg1PM49269", "swg1PI87064", "swg21316054", "swg21244931", "swg1PK47140", "swg21178607", "swg21169266", "swg21610631", "swg21207539", "swg21402781", "swg21606825", "swg21612051", "swg21442347", "swg1PM14115", "swg21424768", "swg21380855", "swg21322605", "swg21270839", "swg21587171", "swg21176381", "swg21253538", "swg1PM15975", "swg1PK41501", "swg1PK85436", "swg21279019", "swg21427167", "swg21351694", "swg1PI82749", "swg21267911", "swg21202265", "swg21607248", "swg21156039", "swg21157016"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "When I try to disable a JVMSERVER it becomes hung and remains in a \"BEING DISABLED\" state.

Whether your need is temporary or permanent; the solution is fast, it\u2019s easy and it\u2019s available today. Read more about Capacity on Demand here [http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/power/hardware/cod/index.html] . The set of questions and answers below are designed to help you better understand how to manage (enable, use, report and pay) Elastic Capacity on Demand. \n\n * What is the first step to activate Elastic Capacity on Demand?\n * I am an IBM Sales representative or Business Partner, how do I fill out the registration form for my customer?\n * What do I do after my machine has been registered?\n * How do I sign the customer agreement and supplement?\n * How do I request a new activation code?\n * What do I do with my new activation code?\n * What if I lost the email containing my activation code?\n\n WHAT IS THE FIRST STEP TO ACTIVATE ELASTIC CAPACITY ON DEMAND? \n If you are not already familiar with the Elastic Capacity on Demand offerings. Please read one of the following knowledgecenter documents: \n\nPower Systems Capacity on Demand User's Guide (POWER8 systems) [http://public.dhe.ibm.com/systems/power/docs/hw/p8/p8ha2.pdf] Power Systems Capacity on Demand User's Guide (POWER7 systems) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/POWER7/p7ha2/p7ha2.pdf] Power Systems Capacity on Demand User's Guide (POWER6 systems) [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/POWER6/ipha2/ipha2.pdf] \nOnce you are ready to sign up for Elastic Capacity on Demand, talk to your IBM sales representative or Business Partner who will complete the sales registration form for each machine you would like to activate.  Back to top \n\n I AM AN IBM SALES REPRESENTATIVE OR BUSINESS PARTNER, HOW DO I FILL OUT THE REGISTRATION FORM FOR MY CUSTOMER? \n The IBM sales representative or Business Partner must complete the sales registration form and then add each machine. SeeOn/Off Capacity on Demand [http://www-912.ibm.com/supporthome.nsf/document/28640809]registration page. After you register the customers machines, notify them so that they know to sign the Customer agreement and supplement.\n\n Back to top \n\n WHAT DO I DO AFTER MY MACHINE HAS BEEN REGISTERED? \n Visit the website: https://www.ibm.com/support/customercare/ss/escod/home [https://www.ibm.com/support/customercare/ss/escod/home]. This website is designed to allow the user to perform the following actions:\n\nA. Sign a Customer Agreement Contract (each company must have at least one of these contracts signed, either manually on paper, or by using this site to sign an electronic agreement)\nB. Sign a Supplement Contract for one or more Machine Type serials. (This can be done via paper agreement or using this site to sign the supplement electronically).\nC. In the event that electronic signature is not appropriate for your company. This site will point users to paper agreements that you can download, print, sign and return to your IBM Sales representative or Business Partner.\nD. Request a new activation code.\nE. View agreements you have signed. (Both Customer Agreements Contract, or Supplement Contracts can be viewed). \n\nOn this website please enter the Machine Type and Serial number(s) for one or more machines. You may sign the electronic agreements one time for multiple agreements, but for requesting an activation code, you must do that action once per machine. \n\nThis website will also show you status of each MT/Serial you have entered. It will allow you to see if the machine has been registered by the IBM Sales Representative/Business Partner, if you have signed the Customer Agreement Contract, and if a Supplement Contract exists. If all three of those exist, then you will be able to request a new activation code. \n\n Back to top \n\n HOW DO I SIGN THE CUSTOMER AGREEMENT AND SUPPLEMENT? \n Visit the website: https://www-304.ibm.com/support/customercare/ss/escod/home [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/customercare/ss/escod/home] \n\nAfter you enter your machine Type and Serial, you will be presented with the machines ECoD status. As long as the machine passes the \"Sales Rep Registration\" check, then the webpage will check if you have a \"Customer Agreement Contract\" and a \"Supplement Contract\". The Actions dropdown list will include the ability for you to \"Sign Agreements\" selecting this option will walk you through signing both the \"Customer Agreement Contract\" and the \"Supplement Contract\". \n\nIf the \"Sales Rep Registration\" check does not pass, then please contact your IBM Sales Representative or Business Partner. \n\nIf there is more then one machine entered, and if none have been registered or had agreements signed before, then the page will list a \"Sign All Agreements\" button at the bottom so that you can sign the agreements one time instead of having to go thru each machine separately. \n\n Back to top \n\n HOW DO I REQUEST A NEW ACTIVATION CODE? \n Visit the website: https://www-304.ibm.com/support/customercare/ss/escod/home [https://www-304.ibm.com/support/customercare/ss/escod/home] \n\nEnter the machine type and serial number for the machine for which you would like to request an activation code. (If you have signed agreements already, you may click on \"Add My Machines\" button at the bottom of the page) \n\nIf the status of the machine shows \"Sales Rep Registration\" check passes, and if \"Customer Agreement Contract\" check passes, and if \"Supplement Contract\" check passes, then the Action dropdown will include \"Request code\". \n\nYou may be selecting Elastic memory activation or Elastic processor activation. You must make a separate request for each, one for memory and another for processor. \n\nCollect the required CoD information from your HMC. \n\nIf you are using the HMC Classic interface, use the HMC Capacity On Demand (CoD) > Processor or Memory > On/Off CoD > View Code Information task. If you are using the HMC Enhanced interface, use the HMC Capacity On Demand > CoD Functions > Capacity on Demand Processor or Memory > On/Off Processor or Memory > View Code Information task. If you are using the HMC Enhanced+ interface, use the Capacity on Demand > CoD functions View Processor Settings or View Memory settings task. \n\nThe following values are required for the \"Request activation code\" webpage.

When your search is more specific, you use a longer keyword to try to narrow the search. However, when you expect fewer returns from your search, it does not happen.

However, before you edit the file, make a backup copy of it. Edit the wimconfig.xml file and search forconnectTimeout.

The process may continue to run after either of these messages are seen. \n\n\nIf a crash did occur, a javacore should have generated on IBM SDK. You will either see the signal as SIGSEGV, SIGILL, SIGABRT, or SIGBUS.

The thread stack has a limited size and eventually its space will run out as the thread stack grows without bounds. \n\nSome traits of recursion: \n- Large thread stacks that appear to repeat \n- An infinite loop that continuously spawns off threads \n- Very large XML documents loaded into the Document Object Model (DOM) \n- JSP or servlets calling itself (usually by executing forward or include to itself) \n- Repeated calls in native functions \n\nIncreasing the thread stack size allows for larger thread stacks. However if the recursion continues to trigger a stack overflow, the next step is to identify what code is causing the recursion from javacores, thread dumps, or even system core files. \n\nA thread stack that indicates it's too large to display can be an indicator of stack overflow. This is especially true if the stack appears to repeat (such as recursive method calls). \n\nJIT/HotSpot Compiled Code \n\nThe JIT/HotSpot compiler (JIT) is designed to speed up the JVM execution times by compiling method calls. This can speed up execution time, but as more aggressive optimizations are used, this can inadvertently cause recursion, resulting in stack overflow or crash. The documents linked below explain how to debug JIT and HotSpot compiler issues:  * JIT Problem Determination for IBM SDK 5.0 and 6.0 using -Xjit [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21294023] \n * Debugging HotSpot failures on the Solaris and HP-UX operating environment [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21081179]\n\n\n\nDepleted Native Stack \nIt is almost guaranteed that a crash will occur if the native stack runs out of space. System cores can be used to identify long and possibly recursively looping native thread stacks. \n\nTo resolve, increase the native stack size (usually by adjusting the operating system limit for stack size) to accommodate the recursive native calls; however, identifying the recursive native calls will help determine the root cause of the stack overflow. \n\n\n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21162896&amp;aid=3] Back to top \n\n[http://www.ibm.com/i/v14/rules/dotted_blue_rule_443.gif] \n\n \n\nDetailed Configuration Options \n\nAdjusting the Stack Sizes (Xss and Xmso) options \nIf this does not work, you can adjust the stack sizes. Doubling the stack size is suggested as a first step; however, every thread that the JVM creates will consume memory. Be careful to not exhaust your physical and heap memory resources. \n\nFor every Java thread, there are two stacks that are utilized. One is for Java code for method calls, and the other is for native C code (on Solaris and HP-UX, only the native stack is utilized). These are adjustable and can be raised to provide more room on the stacks to prevent an overflow. \n\n * Maximum Thread Stack Size (-Xss)\n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  -Xss<size> \n * \n * <size>\n * \n * nn[k|m|g|K|M|G]\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * there is no distinction between native and thread stack sizes\n * \n * only \n * \n * HP-UX\n * \n * \n * \n *  -XX:MainThreadStackSize=<size> \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Initial Thread Stack Size (-Xiss)\n * \n * This is only for distributed platforms (AIX, Linux, Windows)\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  -Xiss<size> \n * \n * <size>\n * \n * nn[k|m|g|K|M|G]\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Initial Native Stack Size (-Xmso)\n * \n * This is only for distributed platforms (AIX, Linux, Windows)\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  -Xmso<size> \n * \n * <size>\n * \n * nn[k|m|g|K|M|G]\n * \n * \n * \n * \n\n\n\nDefault Values \nThis is a chart of default sizes for the various stack size arguments.

The benefits of doing this are: \n\nThere is no need for a full WebSphere MQ implementation on the client machine. \n\u00bb Hardware requirements on the client system are reduced. \n\u00bb System administration requirements are reduced. \n\u00bb A WebSphere MQ application, running on a client can connect to multiple queue managers on different systems. \n\u00bb Alternative channels using different transmission protocols may be used. \n\nWhat applications run on a WebSphere MQ client?\n\nThe WebSphere MQ client on iSeries supports only Java applications that use WebSphere MQ classes for Java or WebSphere MQ classes for Java Message Service (JMS). It does not support applications that use the MQI directly. \n\nThe following functions are not supported: \n\n\u00bb An application that needs syncpoint coordination with other resource managers. \n\u00bb Get(signal) on z/OS. \n\nNote:\n\n\n 1. An application running on a WebSphere MQ client may connect to more than one queue manager concurrently, or use a queue manager name with an asterisk (*). \n 2. The application will have to be changed if you want to link to the queue manager libraries instead of the client libraries, as this function will not be available. \n 3. Service is available for this SupportPac for as long as the WebSphere MQ for iSeries V6 server product is supported by service.\n\n\nSkill Level Required \nUsers should be familiar with the IBM WebSphere MQ product family in general and have particular skills on the platform for which this client is intended. \n\nNew in this Release \n\u2022 Updates the existing iSeries Client to v6.0.2.12. \n\nDetails \nAuthors: WebSphere MQ, Hursley \nCategory: 3 \nReleased Date: 31Oct02 \nLast updated: 18Dec12 \nCurrent Version: 6.0.2.12 \n\u00bbPlease note that the version number shown in the right-hand pane is the version of the WebSphere MQ or WebSphere MB product that this SupportPac applies to.

Introduction\n===============\n\nThis feature allows users to define scripts to run at Tivoli Monitoring OS agents sites at a defined frequency.\n\nThe feature is enabled by default. The administrator can enable/disable it by setting a new environment variable \nKXX_FCP_SCRIPT=true/false (default true)in the agent configuration file, where XX can be:\n\n- LZ for Linux OS agent \n- UX for Unix OS agent\n- NT for Windows OS agent\n\nThis is an overview of the scripting feature; details will be provided in the following sections.\n\nThe OS agent loops, at a configurable interval, looking for script definition property files (*.properties) in a configurable directory path.\nThe property files are parsed and OS Monitoring Agent spawns a new process named \u201cfcp_daemon\u201d if at least one valid script definition is found. This new daemon is responsible for scheduling the script executions and gathering all information regarding running scripts.\n\nAccording to another configurable interval, the OS agent loops getting the execution script results from the fcp_daemon.\nThe OS Agent is able to parse the script standard output, splitting each row in up to 16 attributes.\nAn event is sent for each standard output row of the script and these events can be caught by pure event situations.\n\n1.1 Quick Start\n================\nThe feature is enabled with default values as soon as the OS agent is started. The only action to start using the feature is the following:\n- create a property file under default directory (on Linux/UNIX is $CANDLEHOME/localconfig/<product code>/scripts_definitions, on Windows is %CANDLE_HOME%\\localconfig\\nt\\scripts_definitions) using as an example the provided template script_property.txt.\n\nOnly two properties are required:\nATTRIBUTE_NAME=Any name used to uniquely identify the script definition inside the property file.\nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=The fully qualified path of the script with arguments. \n\nNot only shell scripts but also perl and other types of scripts can be used. You just need to specify the full command to execute in the SCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS property. \nFor example, \"perl C:\\IBM\\scripts\\ITM_Custom_Scripts\\date.pl\". In this example you need to make sure that the location of \"perl\" can be resolved by the agent through the PATH variable in its environment. Specify the full path where \"perl\" is installed otherwise.\n\nFurther properties and details can be found in this document and in the template script_property.txt under $CANDLEHOME/localconfig/lz/scripts_definitions. \n\n\n2. New Attribute groups\n=======================\n\nTwo new attribute groups have been added for this feature as detailed below. Statistic and execution data of all the scripts are stored in these two tables. The name of the property file (Property_File) and the attribute name defined in the property file (Attribute_Name) are the 2 key fields of these two tables. These two keys must be used in situation conditions to filter rows related to a specific script.\n\nAttribute group: KXX_Custom_Scripts (multiple rows), table: KXXSCRPTS (sampled).\nDescription: Configuration and statistic data gathered using custom scripts. It contains a row for each defined script, information on the fcp_daemon and on property files:\n\nAttribute Size Description\n=========================== ===== =========================\nSystem_Name 32 This is the managed system name of the agent.\nTimestamp 16 This is the local time when the data was collected.\nProperty_File 256 The name of the property file.\nAttribute_Name 96 The attribute name that is defined in the properties file. The attribute is used for metric identification.\nScript_Name 512 The name of the script.\nScript_Path 512 The fully qualified path name of the script with arguments.\nCustom_Name 96 The custom name that is defined in the properties file. It is used for custom reporting.\nStandard_Output_Type 4 Standard output type of the script.\nStatus_Code 4 The status of the script. It includes general errors, configuration errors, the status or the execution code returned by the \nScript Provider.\nExecution_Start 16 The time when the last execution of this script started.\nExecution_Duration 4 The duration of the last execution of this script, in seconds. When timing out, the value of the configured timeout is returnd.\nAverage_Execution_Duration 4 The average duration, in seconds, of all the execution of the script.\nRefresh_Interval 4 The interval, in seconds, that the agent attempts to start this script.\nNumber_of_Collections 4 The count of execution attempts of this script since agent started.\nIntervals_Skipped 4 The count of occurrences where an execution of this script is skipped because the previous execution is still running.\nProperty_Group 64 The name of the property group.\nReturn_Code 4 Integer value returned by the Script.\nCust_Label_Str1 16 Label for custom string attribute #1\nCust_Label_Str2 16 Label for custom string attribute #2\nCust_Label_Str3 16 Label for custom string attribute #3\nCust_Label_Str4 16 Label for custom string attribute #4\nCust_Label_Str5 16 Label for custom string attribute #5\nCust_Label_Int1 16 Label for custom integer attribute #1\nCust_Label_Int2 16 Label for custom integer attribute #2\nCust_Label_Int3 16 Label for custom integer attribute #3\nCust_Label_Int4 16 Label for custom integer attribute #4\nCust_Label_Int5 16 Label for custom integer attribute #5\nCust_Label_Float1 16 Label for custom floating point attribute #1\nCust_Label_Float2 16 Label for custom floating point attribute #2\nCust_Label_Float3 16 Label for custom floating point attribute #3\nCust_Label_Float4 16 Label for custom floating point attribute #4\nCust_Label_Float5 16 Label for custom floating point attribute #5\nStandard_Error 2048 Script Standard Error in a unique row\n\nIn addition to script definitions, the table may report rows to return errors found on property files and they are identified by @ANY@ as Attribute_Name. Moreover, a row is always used to report the status of fcp_daemon and it is identified by @ANY@ as Property_File and @ANY@ as Attribute_Name.\n\nAttribute group: KXX_Custom_Scripts_Runtime (multiple rows), table: KXXSCRRTM (pure).\nDescription: Data gathered using custom scripts. It contains the output rows of the scripts currently running:\n\nAttribute Size Description\n======================= ==== =========================\nSystem_Name 32 This is the managed system name of the agent.\nTimestamp 16 This is the local time when the data was collected.\nProperty_File 256 The name of the property file.\nAttribute_Name 96 The attribute name that is defined in the properties file. The attribute is used for metric identification.\nScript_Path 512 The fully qualified path of the script.\nCustom_Name 96 The custom name that is defined in the properties file. It is used for custom reporting. \nReturn_Code 4 Integer value returned by the Script.\nRow_Number 4 Output row number.\nStandard_Output_Type 4 Standard output type of the script.\nStandard_Output_String 2048 Script Standard Output in String Format.\nStandard_Output_Integer 8 Script Output in Integer Format\nStandard_Output_Float 8 Script Output in Floating Point Format (2 decimals).\nCust_Attr_Str1 64 Custom string attribute #1\nCust_Attr_Str2 64 Custom string attribute #2\nCust_Attr_Str3 64 Custom string attribute #3\nCust_Attr_Str4 64 Custom string attribute #4\nCust_Attr_Str5 64 Custom string attribute #5\nCust_Attr_Int1 8 Custom integer attribute #1\nCust_Attr_Int2 8 Custom integer attribute #2\nCust_Attr_Int3 8 Custom integer attribute #3\nCust_Attr_Int4 8 Custom integer attribute #4\nCust_Attr_Int5 8 Custom integer attribute #5\nCust_Attr_Float1 8 Custom floating point (2 decimals) attribute #1\nCust_Attr_Float2 8 Custom floating point (2 decimals) attribute #2\nCust_Attr_Float3 8 Custom floating point (2 decimals) attribute #3\nCust_Attr_Float4 8 Custom floating point (2 decimals) attribute #4\nCust_Attr_Float5 8 Custom floating point (2 decimals) attribute #5\n\nNote: different status conditions can be monitored using the Status_Code field in the statistic table KXX_Custom_Scripts. \nThe following detailed list provides different values for the Status_Code field: \n\nInitial general statuses\nUNKNOWN_ERROR (status code=0) --> Error\nNO_ERROR (status code=1) --> Informational\n\nGeneral daemon statuses\nFEATURE_NOT_ENABLED (status code=40) --> Informational\nDAEMON_STARTING (status code=2) --> Informational\nDAEMON_STARTED (status code=3) --> Informational\nDAEMON_STOPPING (status code=4) --> Informational\nDAEMON_STOPPED (status code=5) --> Informational\nDAEMON_STOPPING_AT_AGENT_STOP (status code=6) --> Informational\nDAEMON_STOPPED_AT_AGENT_STOP (status code=7) --> Informational\nDAEMON_ERROR (status code=8) --> Error\nDAEMON_ERROR_NO_RESTART (status code=9)-> Fatal Error\n\nGeneral directory statuses\nERROR_OPENING_PROP_DIRECTORY (status code=10) --> Error\nPROP_DIRECTORY_NOT_FOUND (status code=11) --> Error\nNO_SCRIPT_DEFINED (status code=12)--> Warning\n\nProperty file statuses\nPROP_FILE_NOT_FOUND (status code=13) --> Error\nERROR_OPENING_PROP_FILE (status code=14) --> Error\n\nScript definition statuses\nSCRIPT_ADDED (status code=15) --> Informational\nSCRIPT_CHANGED (status code=16) --> Informational\nSCRIPT_REMOVED (status code=17) --> Informational\nSCRIPT_INACTIVE (status code=18) --> Informational\nNO_SCRIPT_PATH (status code=21)--> Error\nSCRIPT_PATH_INVALID (status code=22)--> Error\n\nExecution statuses from the fcp_daemon\nFACTORY_UNKNOWN_ERROR (status code=23) --> Error\nFACTORY_NO_ERROR (status code=24)--> Informational\nGENERAL_ERROR (status code=25)--> Error\nOBJECT_NOT_FOUND (status code=26)--> Error\nOBJECT_CURRENTLY_UNAVAILABLE (status code=27)--> Error\nNO_INSTANCES_RETURNED (status code=28)--> Error\nNO_RESPONSE_RECEIVED (status code=29)--> Error\nAUTHENTICATION_FAILED (status code=30)--> Error\nACCESS_DENIED (status code=31)--> Error\nTIMEOUT (status code=32)--> Error\nNOT_IMPLEMENTED (status code=33)--> Error\nRESPONSE_TOO_BIG (status code=34) --> Error\nGENERAL_RESPONSE_ERROR (status code=35)--> Error\nSCRIPT_NONZERO_RETURN (status code=36)--> Error\nSCRIPT_NOT_FOUND (status code=37)--> Error\nSCRIPT_LAUNCH_ERROR (status code=38)--> Error\nINVALID_TOKEN_TYPES(status code=39) --> Error\n\n3. Parameters in OS agent environment files\n===========================================\n\nIt is possible to customize the feature setting parameters in the OS agent environment files:\n- $CANDLEHOME/config/lz.ini file for the Linux OS agent\n- $CANDLEHOME/config/ux.ini for the UNIX OS agent\n- %CANDLE_HOME%\\TMAITM6_x64\\KNTENV for Windows 64bit OS agent\n- %CANDLE_HOME%\\TMAITM6\\KNTENV for Windows 32bit OS agent\n\nThe scripting feature is enabled by default. To disable it set:\n- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT=false\n\nOther parameters can be defined inside the agent environment files based on specific needs:\n\n- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS (default location on Linux/UNIX is $CANDLEHOME/localconfig/<product code>/scripts_definitions, on Windows it is %CANDLE_HOME%\\localconfig\\nt\\scripts_definitions)\nThe location where property files are stored.\n\n- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_INTERVAL (default 60 sec)\nOS agent uses the value of this variable as loop interval in seconds to check execution of running scripts and it sends events if the filter condition is satisfied. The minimum value is 30 seconds, the maximum value is 300 seconds. Invalid values will be reset to the default.\nNote: this parameter is ignored if KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS is set to USE_SCRIPT (see definition below).\n\n- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS (USE_AGENT|USE_SCRIPT|NO - default USE_AGENT)\nIf the agent looping interval defined by KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_INTERVAL is bigger than the script execution frequency, it can happen that data produced by some of the script execution loops is lost.\nTo avoid this behaviour the script execution frequency can be synchronized with the agent looping interval setting the KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS to:\n- USE_AGENT; the value of each script execution frequency is forced to be the maximum between KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_INTERVAL and EXECUTION_FREQUENCY defined in its property file. \n- USE_SCRIPT; the agent looping interval is dynamically set to the minimum frequency value (EXECUTION_FREQUENCY in property file) between all of the defined scripts . The value set by KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_INTERVAL is ignored. The frequency of the scripts remain the ones defined in the property files. When using USE_SCRIPT, the agent looping interval may change every time a script definition is added, changed or removed. In any case, it cannot be lower than the value set by KXX_FCP_OVERRIDE_MIN_FREQUENCY_LIMIT or bigger than 300 seconds.\n- NO; no synchronization is performed and some execution results could be lost.\n\n- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS_CHECK_INTERVAL (default 300 sec) \nAt startup and at every interval defined by this variable, the OS agent checks for any changes in scripts or property files.\nNote that if KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS_CHECK_INTERVAL is less than the agent looping interval it will be reset to the agent looping interval. The maximum allowed value is the default, 300 seconds.\n\n- KXX_FCP_USER (default OS agent user)\nThis parameter is valid only on linux and unix platforms. It defines the user used to spawn fcp_deamon process if different from OS agent process user; all the scripts are executed by this user. Note that the user owner of the OS agent must have correct permission to spawn the fcp_daemon process. On windows a different user must be defined as login of the service \"Monitoring Agent for Windows OS - FCProvider\". The user must have \"Full Control\" permission to CANDLE_HOME and scripts repository directories. For more information please refer to official IBM Monitoring documentation: \nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTFXA_6.3.0.2/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3fp2/oswin/running_as_a_non-admin_user.htm [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTFXA_6.3.0.2/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3fp2/oswin/running_as_a_non-admin_user.htm]\n\n- KXX_FCP_MAX_CDP_DP_THREAD_POOL_SIZE (default 10)\nIt defines the maximum concurrent number of scripts to be executed. Maximum value is 32.\n\n- KXX_FCP_MAX_DAEMON_RESTARTS (default 4)\nThe OS agent watches the fcp_daemon: if an abnormal exit of process occurs, the OS agent restarts it. This is done for the KXX_FCP_MAX_DAEMON_RESTARTS (times at a day). \nThe value 0 must be used to avoid the restart; if -1 is set, the OS agent retries to restart fcp_daemon forever. The restart counter is reset at OS agent restart.\n\n- KXX_FCP_SEND_SCRIPT_RUNTIME_EVENTS (default: true)\nIf set to false, the OS agent stops sending events for each row of script standard output. In this case script outputs are visible on TEP console workspaces but no situations will be displayed and no historical collection data will be collected. \n\n- KXX_FCP_OVERRIDE_MIN_FREQUENCY_LIMIT (default: 5 seconds) \nIt is used when KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS is set to USE_SCRIPT. In this condition, it sets the minimum value of the OS agent looping interval.\nUsing low values for the the OS agent looping interval (less than 5 seconds) is highly invasive and can impact OS agent performances. If a frequent data collection is needed (e.g. every second), it is strongly suggested to customize a script that caches data at the needed frequency and returns the collected data to the OS agent at an higher interval (e.g. every 60 seconds).\n\n\nThe following Agent Builder (CDP) variables can also be used to control the behavior of the fcp_daemon:\n\n- CDP_DP_REFRESH_INTERVAL (default 60 sec) Global script scheduled start time. Used if the frequency is not passed in the script property file.\n\n- CDP_DP_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT (default 30 sec) Global script execution maximum time. When the execution time of a script exceeds this limit, its Status_Code is set to TIMEOUT\n\n- CDP_DP_KILL_ORPHAN_SCRIPTS (Y|N - default N) Global behaviour used by fcp_daemon process for timing out scripts. When set to 'Y', the scripts are killed, otherwise they are abandoned. This value is ignored for a specific script if the KILL_AFTER_TIMEOUT key is set in the script property file\n\n- CDP_MAXIMUM_ROW_COUNT_FOR_CPCI_DATA_RESPONSES (default 1000) Global value added for performance reasons to limit the maximum number of output rows returned by the scripts. Additional rows after this limit are ignored. Allowed values are positive integer. Invalid values means no limit.\n\nThe fcp_daemon also supports the other environment variables used to control Agent Builder agents. For a complete list see the official Agent Builder documentation here:\nhttp://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v61r1/topic/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3/agentbuilder63_user.pdf [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v61r1/topic/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3/agentbuilder63_user.pdf]\n\n4. Parameters in property files \n===============================\n\nThe KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS directory contains a list of *.properties files. Each property file contains a list of \nscripts to run with respective properties in the form of key=value. The properties that can be defined (case in-sensitive) are: \n\n- ATTRIBUTE_NAME (Required - string max 256 characters).\nIt is a name of your choice that defines a specific script and its attributes. The characters that can be used for the \nATTRIBUTE NAME name can be alphabetical, numeric and only the underscore can be used as a special character. If other special characters (even a blank is considered this way) are used they get converted into underscore (_).\nWhen multiple scripts are listed inside the same property file, more different ATTRIBUTE_NAME must be defined (one for each script). It must be the first value specified for each defined script and delimits the start of the properties set for the specific script until the next ATTRIBUTE_NAME.\n\n- SCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS (Required - string max 512 characters).\nIt defines the full path to the script with parameters, separated by a blank. No special characters can be used in the script path name. \nValues containing blanks must be enclosed in single (') or double quotes (\").\nEnvironment variables can be passed, but only enclosed in ${...} for all the platforms. Environment variables must be available in the OS agent process context.\n\n- EXECUTION_FREQUENCY (Optional - default 60 sec).\nIt indicates the script execution frequency.\n\n- CUSTOM_NAME (Optional - string max 256 characters)\nThe user can fill it with a description of the script.\n\n- IS_ACTIVE (true|false - Optional - default true). \nIt activates the script. If false, the script is not executed.\n\n- DISABLE_USE_AGENT_SYNC (true|false - Optional - default false). If true, the EXECUTION_FREQUENCY of the script is respected also if the global variable KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS is set to USE_AGENT.\n\n- KILL_AFTER_TIMEOUT (true|false - Optional - default value defined by the CDP_DP_KILL_ORPHAN_SCRIPTS variable). \nWhen true the script is killed after timeout (a timeout occurs when script execution is greater than the value specified by CDP_DP_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT parameter in OS agent configuration file) otherwise it is ignored. In both cases no data is collected. Note that when KILL_AFTER_TIMEOUT is set, only the script defined in property file is killed and not child processes (if any) spawned by the script. This feature is not supported by Solaris and Windows 32 bit OS agents and any timing out scripts are abandoned. \n\n\nOutput rows returned by a script are parsed. The script returns a standard output (called hereafter as first token). When the script returns more values in the output row they are added as additional tokens for a maximum of 5 strings, 5 integers and 5 floats following a predefined syntax as described below:\n\n- OUTPUT_TYPE (STRING|INTEGER|FLOAT - Optional - default string). It defines the type of the first token returned by each row of the script;\nOUTPUT_TYPE can be:\n1. STRING (default): strings up to 2048 characters. When used, the \"Standard_Output_String\" attribute of KXX_Custom_Scripts_Runtime is filled in by the first token.\n2. INTEGER: allows getting numeric values between -9223372036854775806 and 9223372036854775806. When used, the \"Standard_Output_Integer\" attribute of KXX_Custom_Scripts_Runtime is filled in by the first token.\n3. FLOAT: allows getting numeric values between -92233720368547758.06 and 92233720368547758.06,(with 2 decimal\nprecision). When used, the \"Standard_Output_Float\" attribute of KXX_Custom_Scripts_Runtime is filled in by the first token.\n\n- TOKEN_TYPES (STRING|INTEGER|FLOAT - Optional).\nIt defines the output type of additional tokens after the first one. The user can define a maximum of 5 strings, 5 integers and 5 floats. It is a list of types separated by commas:\n<token_type>,<token_type>,\u2026\ntoken_type can be empty or one from (case insensitive):\n- STRING or S\n- INTEGER or I\n- FLOAT or F\nIf <token_type> is empty, the corresponding token is skipped.\nExamples of the same valid layouts:\n- TOKEN_TYPES=S,I,S,,,F,,F,F\n- TOKEN_TYPES=String,integer,S,,,Float,,f,FLOAT\n\n- TOKEN_LABELS (STRING - maximum 16 characters each label - Optional). \nIt defines the labels of the tokens defined in TOKEN_TYPES. This value is a list of token labels separated\nby commas, and must correspond to the tokens defined by TOKEN_TYPES. \ne.g.:\n- TOKEN_TYPES=S,I,S,,,F,,F,F\n- TOKEN_LABELS=Cpu Name,Cpu number,Description,,,value 1,,value 2,value 3 \nIt is ignored if TOKEN_TYPES is not set.\n\n- TOKEN_SEPARATOR (Optional - default semicolon \";\"). \nIt sets the string to be used as separator to split the output row in tokens. It is ignored if TOKEN_TYPES is not set. Empty value (blank) is accepted as separator and multiple consecutive blanks in output rows are considered as a single one.\n\n\nThe following two parameters allow you to filter the rows output of a script; they are applied by the OS agent only to the first token and they must be used together:\n\n- FILTER_VALUE (Optional).\nThe value used for comparison. It is required if FILTER_OPERATOR is defined.\nIf the OUTPUT_TYPE is a string, the filter value must reflect exactly the string value returned by the script that is intended to be filtered, without any additional quotes (no wildcards allowed).\n- FILTER_OPERATOR (Optional).\nThe operator used for the comparison. It is required if FILTER_VALUE is defined. Accepted FILTER_OPERATOR values include:\n= (equal to)\n!= (different from)\n> (bigger than) only for numeric type\n>= (not lower than) only for numeric type\n< (lower than) only for numeric type\n<= (not bigger than) only for numeric type\n\n\n\n5. Examples of property file\n============================\n\n#First script definition: script ex_script1.sh is launched every 150 seconds, it returns float values and only the output rows equal to 0.5 will be considered by the agent.\n\nATTRIBUTE_NAME=sample1 \nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=/opt/ibm/itmd4255a/localconfig/lz/scripts_definitions/ex_script1.sh\nEXECUTION_FREQUENCY=150\nOUTPUT_TYPE=FLOAT\nFILTER_VALUE=0.5\nFILTER_OPERATOR==\n\n#Second script definition: script ex_script2 is launched every 60 seconds, it returns integer values and only the rows different from 0 will be considered by the agent.\n\nATTRIBUTE_NAME=ex_script2\nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=${CANDLE_HOME}/tmp/check_out.sh\nEXECUTION_FREQUENCY=60\nOUTPUT_TYPE=INTEGER\nFILTER_VALUE=0\nFILTER_OPERATOR=!=\n\n#Third script definition: script ex_script3.sh is launched every 120 seconds with 3 input parameters (the first input parameter is an integer, the second and third are string). It's killed if it hangs or if the execution time is greater than the timeout value.\n\nATTRIBUTE_NAME=ex_script3 \nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=/opt/scripts/ex_script3.sh 1 \"second input parameter\" \"third input parameter\" \nEXECUTION_FREQUENCY=120\nOUTPUT_TYPE=STRING\nKILL_AFTER_TIMEOUT=TRUE\n\n#Fourth script definition: script cpu_mem_percentage.sh is launched every 50 seconds and returns the cpuid as standard output string and 2 float for Idle and Used CPU percentage and 2 integers for Memory and Virtual Memory usage. The pipe is used as separator to parse the output. An example of row that must be returned by the script is: \ncpu2|35,5|65,5|3443|123800\n\nATTRIBUTE_NAME=cpu and mem Usage\nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=${SCRIPT_HOME}/cpu_mem_percentage.sh\nOUTPUT_TYPE=STRING\nTOKEN_TYPES=F,F,I,I\nTOKEN_LABELS= Idle CPU %, Used CPU %, Virt MEM used MB, MEM used MB\nTOKEN_SEPARATOR=|\nEXECUTION_FREQUENCY=50\n\n6. Examples of private situations \n==================================\n\nThe private situations definitions can be inserted into the xx_situations.xml under $CANDLEHOME/localconfig/lz for linux or $CANDLEHOME/localconfig/ux for unix or %CANDLE_HOME%\\localconfig\\nt for Windows to monitor scripts execution.\nExamples below are for the Linux OS agent:\n\n<PRIVATESIT>\n<!-- Sends an alert if the script defined by attribute name \"demo\" in property file \"demo.properties\" returns a row equal to \"demo.log\" -->\n<SITUATION>FCP_CheckLOGFileExists_pr</SITUATION>\n<criteria>\n<![CDATA[*VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts_Runtime.Property_File *EQ 'demo.properties' *AND *VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts_Runtime.Attribute_Name *EQ 'demo' *AND *VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts_Runtime.Standard_Output_String *EQ 'demo.log']]>\n</CRITERIA>\n</PRIVATESIT>\n\n<PRIVATESIT>\n<!-- Sends an alert if a script exits with a return code different from zero -->\n<SITUATION>FCP_ScriptRetCode_pr</SITUATION>\n<CRITERIA>\n<![CDATA[*IF *VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts.Return_Code *NE 0]]>\n</CRITERIA>\n</PRIVATESIT>\n\n<privatesit>\n<!-- Sends an alert when script path is not defined in a property file -->\n<SITUATION NAME=\"FCP_NOPTAH\" INTERVAL=\"000030\" ></SITUATION>\n<criteria>\n<![CDATA[*VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts.Status_Code *EQ NO_SCRIPT_PATH]]>\n</criteria>\n</privatesit>\n\n<privatesit>\n<!-- Sends an alert when a script cannot be launched -->\n<SITUATION NAME=\"FCP_ScriptLaunchErr\" INTERVAL=\"000060\" ></SITUATION>\n<criteria>\n<![CDATA[*VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts.Status_Code *EQ SCRIPT_LAUNCH_ERROR]]>\n</criteria>\n</privatesit>\n\n\n7. Custom Scripts and Custom Scripts Runtime Workspaces\n=======================================================\n\nA new OS agent navigation item has been added in the TEP console. It contains two workspaces: \"Custom Scripts\" and \"Custom Scripts Runtime\". \n\n\"Custom Scripts\" workspace contains the following views:\n- \"Factory Daemon Status\" table view showing informational/warning/error events related to the fcp_daemon process.\n- \"Properties Files error\" table view showing problems related to property files.\n- \"Number of execution per script\" bar chart view summarizing the executions of defined scripts\n- \"Defined Scripts\" table view showing detailed information of defined scripts.\n\n\"Custom Scripts Runtime\" workspace is called clicking on the anchor of a specific script and provides information on script execution. The views provided by default on the TEP console are to be intended as example workspaces with all available custom attributes. Users can duplicate and customize workspaces to filter out fields that are not needed according to the output returned by their scripts.\n\n\n8. Known problems and limitations\n===================================\n\n- The Scripting Feature is not supported on Windows 2003 64-bit systems.\n- Kill after timeout does not work on Solaris and Windows 32 bit OS agents.\n- The fcp_daemon may stop executing scripts in Windows 32 bit If some scripts do not complete within the time out period and the user has turned on intensive tracing. If this happens the data reported on the TEP will reflect the last time the script was actually run. It is also possible that the OS agent will stop returning data. Terminating the fcp_daemon process will allow the agent to resume proper operation.\n- SCRIPT_NONZERO_RETURN is returned instead of SCRIPT_NOT_FOUND or SCRIPT_LAUNCH_ERROR on Solaris.\n- The scripting feature does not provide full Native Language Support; some issues may be found using Nationalized characters in property files or script outputs.\n- On windows OS agent there is no possibility of executing scripts residing on a mapped network drive.\n\n9. Troubleshooting\n===================\n\nStandard KBB_RAS1 variable will apply to the OS agent and to the fcp_daemon processes.\nTo apply a specific trace setting to fcp_daemon only, use the KXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1 variable; when KXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1 is set, the value specified by KBB_RAS1 is ignored by fcp_daemon.\n\nTo trace the operations logged by the OS agent core threads of the feature:\nKBB_RAS1=ERROR (UNIT:factory ALL)\n\nTo trace scripting queries from the ITM server and events sent to the server, add the entries:\n(UNIT:klz34 ALL) (UNIT:klz35 ALL) on Linux OS agent\n(UNIT:kux48 ALL) (UNIT:kux49 ALL) on Unix OS agent\n(UNIT:knt84 ALL) (UNIT:knt85 ALL) on Windows OS agent\n\nTo view tema traces to verify private situation execution, add the entries:\n(UNIT:kraavp all) (UNIT:kraapv all)\n\nTo see the execution of the scripts and how the data from the scripts is being parsed set:\nKXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1=Error (UNIT:command ALL)\n\nTo troubleshoot problems in the communication between the os agent and fcp_daemon add this trace level to both KBB_RAS1 and KXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1:\n(UNIT:cps_socket FLOW) (UNIT:cpci FLOW)\n\nTo see the interaction between the OS agent process and the fcp_daemon in detail add to both KBB_RAS1 and KXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1:\n(UNIT:cps_socket ALL) (UNIT:cpci ALL)\n\n\n10. Quick Start Scenario\n=========================\n\nThe following section describes the minimum steps needed to configure a linux OS agent to run 2 custom scripts.\n\nCustom Scripts descriptions\n===========================\nLet's suppose the user has 2 scripts under a directory /scripts_repo:\n\n- checkDIRsize.sh that checks the size of a specified directory passed as input parameter. Its output is an integer like the following: \n\n4594740\n\n- cpu_mem_usage.sh that checks the used CPU percentages and used Swap Memory megabytes. Its output is returned in the following form:\n\ncpu1|96,5|23800\n\nwhere the first token is the CPU id, the second token is the used CPU percentage, the third token is the used swap memory in megabyte.\n\nCustomization needed to have the linux OS agent run above scripts\n==============================================================\nThe feature is enabled with default values as soon as the OS agent is started:\n\n- you could create one or two property files (<Any Name>.properties)under the default directory $CANDLEHOME/localconfig/lz/scripts_definitions. In this example let's create 2 property files one for each script called checkDIRsize.properties and cpu_mem_usage.properties:\n\n#CheckDIRsize.properties\nATTRIBUTE_NAME=OPT_DIR_SIZE\nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=/scripts_repo/checkDIRsize.sh /opt\nEXECUTION_FREQUENCY=20\nOUTPUT_TYPE=INTEGER\n\n#cpu_mem_usage.properties \nATTRIBUTE_NAME=cpu_mem_usage\nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=/scripts_repo/cpu_mem_percentage.sh\nOUTPUT_TYPE=string\nTOKEN_TYPES=F,I\nTOKEN_LABELS= Used CPU %, Swap MEM used MB\nTOKEN_SEPARATOR=|\nEXECUTION_FREQUENCY=10\n\n- There is no need to restart the OS agent after adding (or changing) the 2 property files above: the OS agent checks script definition directory with a specified time interval (default value 300 seconds). Open the TEP console and under the \"Custom Scripts\" workspace the scripts details and results are shown.\n\nChange History:\n----------------------\n2017-01-09: Added new item under \"8.

Run the setup of Lotus Domino.\n    \n    \n 2. Enter a username and companyName. Both are case sensitive. Remember the companyName and userid. They will be required later for configuring the server.\n    \n    \n 3. Choose the program and data destination folder path.\n    \n    \n 4. Choose the Domino Enterprise Server option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring Lotus Domino server: \n 1. Once the installation is over, start the Domino server from the Start menu. The Domino server setup begins.\n    \n    \n 2. Select Set up the first server or a stand alone server.\n    \n    \n 3. Provide a server name.\n    \n    \n 4. Enter the password under organization password.\n    \n    \n 5. Enter only the last name; remove the first and middle name. Enter administration password. Remember this user id and password for configuring the server.\n    \n    \n 6. Select Web Browsers (HTTP services) for automatically running the webserver once the Domino server starts.\n    \n    \n 7. Next, accept the defaults and continue the setup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the Lotus Domino server for Host On-Demand using webadmin.nsf \n 1.  Java has to be installed on the machine which is used for configuring the Lotus Domino server.\n     \n     \n 2.  Once the setup of the server is done, start the Domino server from the Start menu. \n     \n     \n 3.  In the browser, check for http://localhost or http://IP-Address to confirm the installation.\n     \n     \n 4.  Open http://localhost/webadmin.nsf to configure the server.\n     \n     \n 5.  Enter the userid and password from Step 5 of Configuring Lotus Domino server above.\n     \n     \n 6.  Click on the configuration tab.\n     \n     \n 7.  Click the Server on the left and All Server Documents.\n     \n     \n 8.  Click on the server link that has been created and click Edit Server on the top. If you don't see any menu at the top, java is not installed properly.\n     \n     \n 9.  Enable the Load internet configurations from server\\Internet sites document.\n     \n     \n 10. Click Save & Close on the top menu.\n     \n     \n 11. Click on the Web > Internet sites menu on the left panel.\n     \n     \n 12. Select Web from the Add Internet Site menu on the top.\n     \n     \n 13. Give a descriptive name for the site. Enter the company name entered in Step 2 of Installation of Lotus Domino above. Remember the company name is case sensitive.\n     \n     \n 14. Give the ip address of the system where Lotus Domino is installed.\n     \n     \n 15. Remove the * and select the server that you entered in Step 2 of Configuring Lotus Domino server above.\n     \n     \n 16. Click Save & Close in the top menu.\n     \n     \n 17. Click on the website link you created which would be listed under Web (left panel) and Internet Sites.\n     \n     \n 18. Click on the Website and select Create Rule in the top menu.\n     \n     \n 19. Select Directory under Type of rule. \n     \n     \n 20. Enter the URL pattern under Incoming URL pattern. This is the alias one generally provides when configuring Apache. \n     \n     For example, if we want to access Host On-Demand as http://IP-Address/hod/HODMain.html the incoming URL pattern should be /hod.\n     \n     \n 21. Enter the path of Host On-Demand under Target Server Directory. \n     \n     For example: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IBM\\HostOnDemand\\HOD\n     \n     \n 22. Click Save & Close under the top menu.\n     \n     \n 23. Restart the Lotus Domino server. (Exit command will exit the Lotus Domino Server running in the console. Restart the server again).\n     \n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing Host On-Demand http://IP-Address/alias/...

The lower level attribute like\n   archived, name and so on of the attribute 'Created By' or\n   'Modified By' are in server language and not in English\n   \n   \n   Steps to reproduce:\n   1. Make sure the CCM server has the language package installed,\n   for example Japanese (any other language will be able to\n   reproduce too)\n   2. Create a new OOTB Scrum Project Area called JP_PA\n   3. Prepare two browsers, one's locale set to Japanese, the other\n   remains as English, for example IE (for Eng) and FF (for JP)\n   4. go to JP_PA from JP locale Browser and create a query. Filter\n   on 'Created By' and expand it to see the underlying attributes.\n   \n   Expected Behavior\n   The underlying attribute names should be consistent with the\n   client locale setting of the browser\n   \n   Actual Behavior:\n   The underlying attribute names are in language that is different\n   from client local.

If not, then enabling the server for TLS 1.2 will not have any effect. \n\n \n\nOn the IBM iOS side, verify that Technology Refresh 6 or newer has been installed by confirming the *INSTALLED Level of the SF99707 Group PTF.\n\n\nStep 1) Enter the command CHGSYSVAL QSSLPCL and remove *OPSYS (which equates to *SSLV3 and *TLSV1). Then list the protocols that are desired to be supported. To just add the latest TLS protocol support, enter:\n\n*TLSV1.2\n*TLSV1.1\n*TLSV1\n*SSLV3 \n\n Note: Ensure that the protocol lists are concurrent. Do not skip a protocol.\n\n\nStep 2) Enter the command DSPSYSVAL QSSLCSLCTL and verify it is set to *OPSYS. If set to *USRDFN, then the SSL Administration for this system is customizing the list of ciphers. If this is the case, enter CHGSYSVAL QSSLCSL to verify the ciphers supported and include the new ciphers:\n\n\n *RSA_AES_256_CBC_SHA256 \n\n *RSA_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 \n\n \n\nStep 3) Open Digital Certificate Manager (DCM) from the IBM i Tasks option on the Welcome Panel of the IBM Navigator for i port 2001 interface, and log into the *SYSTEM keystore.\n\n\nStep 4) From the left navigation pane, expand Manage Applications and then select Update Application Definition.\n\n\nStep 5) Select the Server radio button and then select the Continue button.\n\n\nStep 6) in the list of Server Applications, find and select the radio button for IBM i TCP/IP Telnet Server and then select the Update Application Definition button.\n\n\nStep 7) Change the SSL Protocols from *PGM to Define Protocols Suppored. Check the protocols desired for this application to support or use. This list should match or be a subset of the QSSLPCL System Value. For example: TLS 1.2, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.0 and SSLV3.\n\n\nStep 8) Change SSL Cipher Specification Options from *PGM to Define Cipher Specification List. The first six ciphers in the list should be enabled and are a good starting point. But you may want to set RSA_AES_256_CBC_SHA256 and RSA_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 as the first two in the list. RSA_AES_128_CBC_SHA is a good cipher to have listed third as it supports more than just the TLS 1.2 protocol.\n\n\nStep 10) At the bottom of the screen, click the Apply button.\n\n\nAt the next restart of the Telnet Server, it will be enabled for TLS 1.2 and prefer the TLS 1.2 specific ciphers. \n\n \n\nAccess for Windows is enabled for TLS 1.2 in Service Pack SI50567 for IBM i Access for Windows r7.1. You could also test the Telnet Server by using the IBM i v7.1 Telnet Client. The same system values have to be set to enable TLS 1.2 protocols and ciphers. But in DCM, update the Application Definition, chose Application type of \"Client\", then the IBM i Telnet Client and make the same protocol and cipher changes. Start a new interactive job and telnet to the destination telnet server. (If an interactive job is running before the DCM configuration change, end it and restart)\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Enabling iSeries Access Host Servers [ http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1020017]\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Operating System IBM i Communications-TCP IBM i 7.1 Standard Operating System IBM i 7.1 IBM i 7.1 Standard", "document_id": "nas8N1019971", "all_doc_ids": ["swg21699845", "nas8N1019971", "swg21584390", "swg22008933", "swg27048798", "swg21646724", "swg21984404", "swg22001891", "swg1IT22689", "swg21960133", "swg21249100", "swg21986882", "swg21988203", "swg21967350", "swg1PI65308", "swg21983185", "swg21697303", "swg21697925", "swg21999364", "swg22007135", "swg1PI56584", "nas8N1020017", "swg1PI62303", "swg22016796", "swg1PI48069", "swg21973529", "swg1PM69593", "swg27046894", "swg27048181", "swg22001375", "swg22010239", "swg1IV82451", "swg27039743", "swg21985289", "swg21903219", "isg1LI80059", "swg1IT21420", "swg1PJ45286", "swg1IO19232", "swg27041674", "swg21978072", "swg21977527", "swg21974267", "swg21996686", "ibm10717395", "swg22006747", "swg21578730", "swg21653960", "swg21959321", "swg21969880"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "This Q&A is abstracted from a PMR\nPlanning a tiered upgrade, MQ then broker.", "id": "DEV_Q087", "answers": [{"answer_id": 74227060, "document_id": "swg21652286", "question_id": "DEV_Q087", "text": "", "answer_start": -1, "answer_end": 0, "answer_category": null}], "is_impossible": true}], "context": " TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n If you have a problem in WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) with Broker startup you now have a new tool in your toolbox that will help you resolve your problem more quickly and help you understand the reasons for the problem so you can avoid it in the future. \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe new Dynamic Problem Determination Tool for WebSphere Message Broker offers a quick and informative way to find the solution to your problem. \n\nCheck out this new Tool at - \n\n\n\n * Dynamic Problem Determination Tool for WebSphere Message Broker V8 [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/c7e1448b-9651-456c-9924-f78bec90d2c2/entry/try_a_dynamic_guide_to_help_with_troubleshooting_message_broker?lang=en]\n\n\nWe would love to hear your input and your feedback - \n\n * What other areas would you like to see in this Tool ? \n * Do you find this tool helpful ? \n\n\nSimply add your comments in the \"Comments\" box either at the bottom or right hand side of this page.\n\n \n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n WMB MB WebSphere Message Broker IBM Integration Bus IIB IBMIB MQ Integrator WBIMB WBI-MB MQSI WMQI", "document_id": "swg21652286", "all_doc_ids": ["swg21669778", "swg24012457", "swg27012172", "swg21623208", "swg21615685", "swg21299791", "swg21685548", "swg21305391", "swg21302942", "swg21441366", "swg21302948", "swg21166659", "swg21631654", "swg21055239", "swg21177049", "swg21660253", "swg21313631", "swg1IC73823", "swg21575522", "swg24011189", "swg1PI32277", "swg21625855", "swg21681704", "swg1PI21535", "swg1PI17213", "swg1PK73269", "swg21177048", "swg1PM90120", "swg21501896", "swg21137319", "swg27016493", "swg24032010", "swg1PI31812", "swg21299462", "swg24009370", "swg21652286", "swg27017027", "swg21312967", "swg21625857", "swg1PK73298", "swg1PI32626", "swg21957998", "swg21457378", "swg21299471", "swg24030716", "swg21625856", "swg21299818", "swg27007159", "swg21302946", "swg21426198"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I setup a cq demo env in redhat linux with oracle database, CQ 7.1.2, LRKS 8.1.3,  Linux CQ client can login CQ as the following picture 1, but CQWEB login page can't retrieve the repository dropdown list options as the following picture 2.

My understanding is that J2EE 1.3 includes servlet 2.3 and JSP 1.2, how can I comprehend it? 14:05 Is there a definitive place to find out the available Jython commands for writing scripts? The command hinting in the console doesn't cover very much especially any of the more obscure stuff I really want to know. 19:21 Are the \"ttl settings\" and \"cacheLocalHost settings\" redundant? If not, which API call uses which type of cache call? What should we use it for WAS 6.1? 21:21 Is there a way to rename a Cluster name? 22:24 My nodes do not appear to be synchronized, what should I do? 25:40 We are using Jython script to perform our deployment, but it is failing for some applications and working for some applications. The error message has to do with something related to Java testing issues, I want to know more about why this is happening? 28:05 I have applications that run using launch client that don't seem to take advantage of the custom properties. Is there a solution to this? 30:54 I am interested in testing the compatibility of the different Jyphon script commands/libraries from WAS v7 on the WAS v6.1 environment. Is there any way I can do that? 32:12 Does the rollout update feature of WAS cause the server to restart? If it does, how do we overcome this limitation? 36:46 Are there any gotchas that I should be aware of when changing the computer name and IP address of a node? 38:32 I have a question on synchronization with have global security enabled. I have noticed at times that when we start/stop the deployment manager, we get a message that says a new certificate/signer is available, do you want to add this signer to the deployment manager or keystore - should we take that action and say yes, or should we do another way of synchronization? 40:46 When we have multiple WebSphere installs on a machine, does WebSphere have the mechanism of handling port conflicts across the multiple installs? 43:22 Is there a best practice to validating EAR files?

The developers come out with a new model and I want to update that application, how can I do that? 54:06 Is there a way or a map to check on the correspondence between commands and objects in WebSphere so that I can understand what the objects are, what properties are, and what I can do with the objects? 57:26 I am trying to do a full synchronization after an addNode command, but it is not passing credential, and ends up failing the full synchronization in wsadmin.

Is there a solution to this issue? \n\nCAUSE\nIf the value of Retry Attempts is set to 0 on the DataPower MQ Queue Manager object, this negates the benefits of the Long Retry Interval since it will not be used. DataPower will retry forever using the specified Retry Interval. The default setting of Retry Attempts as 0 and Retry Interval as 1 second is provided to preserve backward compatibility. However, these default values should be changed to take advantage of Long Retry Interval feature available in firmware.\n\nANSWER\nThe solution to the issue of having DataPower vulnerable to the MQ Queue Manager being inaccessible is to change the Retry Attempts parameter on the Configure MQ Queue Manager window from 0 to some number. As an example, change the parameters as follows: \n\n *  Retry Attempts - change the default of 0 to 6 Retry Interval - change the default of 1 to 10 seconds Long Retry Interval - change the default of 1800 to 600 seconds (10 minutes) \n\n\nIn the event that the Queue Manager is down or a connection is not established, the above example configuration will allow the MQ QM Object to retry 6 times with 10 second intervals. After 6 attempts, the MQ QM object will retry every 10 minutes.  \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration WebSphere DataPower Integration Appliance XI50 Firmware 3.8 Business Integration WebSphere DataPower Low Latency Appliance XM70 Firmware 3.8", "document_id": "swg21431301", "all_doc_ids": ["swg21431301", "swg21502873", "swg27021649", "swg1IC58635", "swg21971827", "swg1IT14350", "swg21367002", "swg1IC62153", "swg1IT18153", "swg1IT02476", "swg21429382", "swg27045930", "swg21422886", "swg1IT15293", "swg21444492", "swg27048270", "swg21291189", "swg21610078", "swg1PI15315", "swg1IT14409", "swg21683568", "swg21410251", "swg21620770", "swg21405299", "swg1PM73355", "swg21680303", "swg21239329", "swg21377610", "swg21576664", "swg21516288", "swg1IV32346", "nas8N1015837", "nas8N1014652", "swg21624736", "swg21903494", "swg21469404", "swg1IZ67131", "swg1IC52916", "swg1IC69417", "swg27020934", "swg21647231", "swg21199910", "swg21470451", "swg1IT01770", "swg21602521", "swg1IT10498", "nas8N1015953", "swg21667396", "swg21615923", "swg21678834"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "When trying to publish a project from IBM Integration Designer (IID) to the local Process Server, it fails with error ADMA5014E in SystemOut.log.

In addition to this file, README,\nyou can find more information on the WebSphere MQ Web site:\n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wmq/ [http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wmq/]\n\nFor current information on known problems and available fixes,\nSupportPacs(TM), product documentation and online versions of this and\nother readme files see the Support page of the WebSphere MQ Web site at:\n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wmq/support [http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wmq/support]\n\nABOUT THIS RELEASE\n==================\n\nNomenclature\n------------\nThe terms \"WMQ V5.3.1\" and \"WMQ V5.3.1.0\" both refer to the same WMQ Refresh\nPack without subsequent service installed. Throughout this readme, references\nto \"WMQ V5.3.1.x\" refer to WMQ 5.3.1 with or without subsequent service\ninstalled.\n\nNew in this release\n-------------------\n\nThis is the twelfth FixPack for IBM WebSphere MQ V5.3.1 for HP NonStop Server,\nand is designated V5.3.1.12, with associated APAR IT15471.\n\nThis release is cumulative for all service and internal defect correction \nperformed since WMQ 5.3.1 was released. \n\nAll native object and executable files distributed with this FixPack have the\nfollowing version procedure strings:\n\nT0085H06_31MAY2016_V53_1_12_<buildid> (Where buildid is the internal build\nidentifier)\n\nThe Non-native library distributed with this FixPack has the following \nversion procedure string:\n\nT0085H06_28FEB2015_V53_1_11 \n\nIf upgrading from V5.3.1.5 or later releases, this FixPack does NOT require \nTNS (non-native) applications to be re-bound with the MQI library. More on \nthis is described later on in this readme.\n\nIBM have not identified any new HP NonStop Server system software problems\nsince V5.3.1.6 was released. The current set of recommended solutions is \ndescribed later on in this readme.\n\nIBM recommends that you ensure that your HP NonStop Server system software\nproducts are at SPR levels that incorporate these fixes (solutions) as a\npreventive measure. IBM has tested WMQ with these fixes in our own\nenvironment before making the recommendations.\n\nImportant note about SSL channels\n---------------------------------\n\nThis release includes a new version of openSSL (1.0.2h) to maintain currency\nwith known vulnerabilities discovered since the version shipped with V5.3.1.\nA new version of the SSLupdate.pdf document was provided with the V5.3.1.10\nfixpack, and is also included with this this release, located in the \n<install_path>/opt/mqm/READMES/en_US directory. If you use SSL channels you\nshould review the revised version of SSLupdate.pdf prior to installing this\nfixpack.\n\nThe following SSL information applies if you are upgrading from WMQ V5.3.1 and\nare using SSL channels. The following procedure is not required if you have \nalready installed WMQ V5.3.1.1\n\nSeveral of the fixes in this and previous FixPacks that relate to SSL channels\nchange the way that SSL certificates are configured with WebSphere MQ. If\nyou use SSL channels you will need to review the new documentation supplement\nSSLupdate.pdf for information about this change and make configuration changes\nPlease also see the Post-installation section below for a summary of the\nrequired changes.\n\nIn V5.3.1.10 Patch1 and all later releases, CipherSpecs that use the SSLv3\nprotocol were deprecated. Continued use of SSLv3 CipherSpec's is not recommended\nbut may be enabled by setting the AMQ_SSL_V3_ENABLE environment variable.\nIn addition to that Env01=AMQ_SSL_V3_ENABLE=1 has to be added to the MCA stanza \nof the queue manager's qmproc.ini file.\n\nWith OpenSSL 1.0.2h the following CipherSpecs have been deprecated:\nDES_SHA_EXPORT1024\nRC4_56_SHA_EXPORT1024\nRC4_MD5_EXPORT\nRC2_MD5_EXPORT\nDES_SHA_EXPORT\nTLS_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA\n\nWhile WMQ V5.3.1.12 does still support these weak CipherSpecs for compatibility\nreasons, they are deemed as not secure and should not be used. \n\nPlease check product documentation to confirm the CipherSpec is valid and consult\ndocumentation for any instructions when adding new environment variables.\n\n\nImportant note about WebSphere MQ V5.3 classes for Java and JMS\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFixpack V5.3.1.10 resolved an incompatibility between NonStop Java 7 and the\nWMQ product libraries - that fix is also included in V5.3.1.12.\nThe method used to configure Java in V5.3.1.10 and later differs from \nthat in releases prior to V5.3.1.10. The Java.pdf document shipped in the \n<install_path>/opt/mqm/READMES/en_US directory was updated to reflect the\nchange. Java/JMS users migrating from versions prior to 5.3.1.10 should \nreview the updated document.\n\nImportant note about instmqm for V5.3.1\n---------------------------------------\n\nSince FixPack V5.3.1.5, IBM provided a modified WebSphere MQ product\ninstallation script, instmqm, for any level of V5.3.1. The new installation\nscript includes a workaround for the OS problem introduced in G06.29/H06.06\nwhere the OSS 'cp' command creates Guardian files in Format-2 form during an\ninstallation rather than Format-1. This change caused problems binding and\ncompiling non-native and native COBOL applications, as well as wasting a lot of\ndisk space because of the very large default extents settings for the Format-2\nfiles created by OSS cp.\n\nInstmqm has been modified in FixPack V5.3.1.5 to work around this change in OSS\ncp by forcing all Guardian files in an installation to be created as Format-1.\nThe use of the new installation script is recommended for all new V5.3.1\ninstallations.\n\nExisting installations that are not affected by the application relink or\nrebind problems can remain as they are.\n\nProduct fix history\n-------------------\n\nThe following problems are resolved in FixPack V5.3.1.12:\n\nAPAR IT08589 - WebSphere MQ V6 or V7 queues become \"missing\" from clusters. Application\ncalls to MQOPEN (sometimes MQPUT1, MQPUT) suffer queue name lookup\nerrors (Examples: 2085, 2082) when they try to access the affected \ncluster queues. \n\nAPAR IT10388 - When the receiving QMgr has its channel set with SSLCAUTH(OPTIONAL),\nthe Nonstop Queue Manager insists on sending a certificate to \nidentify itself. The remote side, however, does not require one\n\nAPAR IT11557 - Updated OpenSSL library to version 1.0.2h. This update deprecates sslchiph \ncipherspec TLS_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA and fixes various security \nvulnerabilities.\n\nAPAR IT12856 - When a node is removed from an MQ cluster and there is an automatically\ndefined cluster sender channel from a MQ node on NonStop to the removed\nnode, the sender channel on NonStop can go into state INITIALIZING and\nstay there for up to 60 minutes instead of being deleted after the first\nretry interval has expired.\n\nAPAR IT12875 - When a message is put into a remote/cluster queue within a TMF user\ntransaction and while the corresponding transmit queue is empty or almost\nempty, it can take up to 60 seconds after the end of the transaction\nuntil the message is transmitted. As a side effect automatic channel \nstarts can also be delayed.\n\nAPAR IT12894 - Java 7 SSL clients behave differently than previous versions which \nresulted in an RC 2009 error on its connection attempt. This\nis fixed with V.5.3.1.12.\n\nAPAR IT14169 - When a CPU is stopped, some sender channels were not recovered \nand stayed in inactive state. \n\nAPAR IT15316 - Memory allocation during MCA and LQMA creation and initialization was\nnot handled properly and may result in an unresponsive system.\n\nAPAR IT15317 - Under some conditions agents stay alive but don't accept new\nconnections. That is the case if an agent has reached the maximum \nnumber of connections it is allowed to handle during its lifetime\nbut the agent can't terminate before the last connection has been \nclosed.\n\nAPAR IT15490 - A configured process name rule has not been applied because it \nwas defined with lower case characters, while the operating \nsystem interface delivered upper case process names. Since the name\ncomparison then fails the configuration is not applied.\n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were\nalso released with V5.3.1.12:\n\nIN000100 - The CRTMQM command may fail with error 1017 if queue managers are \ncreated in parallel.\n\nIN000101 - The installer has been enhanced to properly support SMF virtual disks\nif the system revision is on H06.26 and newer or J06.15 and newer.\n\nIN000102 - Removed access to uninitialized memory within mqconn which may result in\nRC 2059 MQRC_Q_MGR_NOT_AVAILABLE.\n\n\nFixes introduced in previous fixpacks\n=====================================\nThe following problems were resolved in FixPack V5.3.1.11:\n\nAPAR IT03572 - In V5.3.1.10, the dspmqver -V command displays the string \n\"VPROC\" rather than the VPROC string encoded in the product.\nV5.3.1.11 corrects this problem.\n\nAPAR IT04083 - Error 30 received by Queue Server in a complex Queue Manager \nconfiguration using MQGMO_SET_SIGNAL. This is a result of\nthe limit on the number of outstanding messages sent by the \nprocess not being set to the same value as the internal counter.\nThis results in the Queue Server reporting \"Guardian error 30 \nattempting to send signal notification\" in the queue manager \nerror log.\n\nAPAR IT04533 - Cluster sender channels fail to start following a CPU failure\non a 2 CPU system when the Repository Manager and Channel Server\nare both in the same CPU. Following the CPU failure, the Queue\nManager error log repeatedly reports message AMQ9422 \n\"Repository manager error, RC=545284114\" \n\nAPAR IT04876 - Some ssl channels with mismatched sslchiph cipherspecs run \nsuccessfully because protocol versions are not compared. \n\nAPAR IT05353 - Mitigation for SSLV3 POODLE Attack - CVE-2014-3566 \n\nAPAR IT07330 - WebSphere MQ V5.3.X Process does not write FDC (First \nFailure Symptom Report) records when the current FDC file is\nphysically full. This can result in processes experiencing error\nconditions, but the error condition not being reported in the \nFDC file. This fix changes the error handling to identify this\nscenario and switch to a new FDC file with an incremented \nsequence number \n\nAPAR IV19854 - The master repository manager in a partial repository \nunnecessarily subscribes to each cluster queue manager that\nit is aware of. This causes a significant increase in the number\nof subscriptions that are made, and in large clusters this can\ncause performance problems. \n\nAPAR IY87702 - SIGSEGV resulting from failed getpwnam. In some circumstances\ngetpwnam can return a success value in errno, but a null\npointer as the user record. This results in a SIGSEGV from \namqoamd. This change adds a check for this condition and handles\nit correctly. \n\nAPAR IY91357 - Altering a channel definition unintentionally resets the \nSSLPEER() attribute for the channel. \nWhen a channel with SSLPEER information is modified to include\neither MSGEXIT or MSGDATA attributes, the SSLPEER attribute \nbecomes blank. V5.3.1.11 resolves this problem. \n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were\nalso released with V5.3.1.11:\n\n909 - In the GA release, the TFILE was opened with depth 100 in the\nGuardian NonStop process pairs. In configurations with large\nlarge numbers of connecting applications/threads, this could\nresult in probe QS270000 errors from nspPrimary, with an Arith1\nvalue of 83 (0083 Attempt to begin more concurrent transactions \nthan can be handled). This change increases the TFILE open depth\nto 1000. The default value can be changed from 1000 to a value\nbetween 100 and 1000 using MQTFILEDEPTH environment variable.\nIf a value < 100 or > 1000 is specified, a value of 100 will\nbe used, and an FDC will be reported with the text\n\"Invalid MQTFILEDEPTH specified - using default\"\n\n1380 - In the cra library, several FFST code sites report an error \nwithout reporting the name of the channel involved in the error\ncondition. This change adds the channel name to the FFST report\nin cases where the channel name is available to the calling code\n\n1471 - In earlier releases of 5.3.1, if a garbage argument string is \nsupplied to dspmqfls, the command abends rather than reporting a\nusage message. V5.3.1.11 resolves this problem\n\n1597 - In earlier releases of 5.3.1, the dspmqfls output shows a \nQueue/Status server value. Status servers were part of the V5.1\narchitecture but are not present in 5.3.1. V5.3.1.11 changes the \nmessage to reflect the fact that all objects are now managed by\nQueue Servers.\n\n2230 - In earlier releases of 5.3.1, the runmqsc command \n\"DISPLAY QSTATUS(*) TYPE(HANDLE) ALL\" does not cleanly handle a\nscenario where there are more than 500 handles. Attempts to use\nthe command when there are more than 500 handles to be returned\nresults in FFSTs with probe NS013000 from nspReply, and probe\nQS264002 from qslHandleHandleStatus. See later section on\n\"KNOWN LIMITATIONS, PROBLEMS AND WORKAROUNDS\"\n\n4158 - Slow memory leak in MQDISC in non-native library. In prior\nreleases, the non-native implementation of MQDISC contained a\nslow memory leak. This resulted in applications performing \nrepeated MQCONN/MQDISC operations during the process lifetime\neventually receiving a MQRC_STORAGE_NOT_AVAILABLE error from\nMQCONN, and an FFST for probe ZS219001 from zstInsertPCD. The\nproblem can also manifest as a probe XC130006 from \nxehExceptionHandler inside an MQOPEN call.\n\n4395 - If memory allocation for internal working storage fails during\nan attempt to create a dynamic queue, the LQMA assoicated with\nthe operation will ABEND, rather than returning a completion\ncode of 2071 (MQRC_STORAGE_NOT_AVAILABLE). This change resolves\nthe problem.\n\n4421 - If an attempt to start an OAM server detects an existing OAM\nserver in the CPU, in prior releases, the FFST generated did not\ninclude the process name. This change amends the FFST to\ninclude the process name of the offending process, where that\nname can be determined. \n\n4428 - The altmqfls command \"resetmeasure\" was incorrectly documented\nin the original version of the SysAdmin guide. See later section\n\"DOCUMENTATION UPDATES\"\n\n4496 - In earlier versions of this readme file, the instructions on \nhow to reassign Queue Server for \nSYSTEM.CLUSTER.TRANSMISSION.QUEUE are incorrect. Refer to the\n\"KNOWN LIMITATIONS, PROBLEMS AND WORKAROUNDS\" section for the\ncorrect procedure.\n\n4523 - If an OAM server attempts to start in a CPU, and there is \nalready an OAM server registered, prior to V5.3.1.11, the OAM\nsubsystem reported that there was a rogue process, but not\nthe name of the process. This change enhances the error\nreporting to report the name of the rogue process. \n\n4726 - Prior to this fixpack, the instmqm script did not check for\nsaveabend files and FFSTs generated during the validation\nphase of the installation. V5.3.1.11 adds this check.\n\n4774 - The cobol binding library, MQMCB, was shipped without symbols in\nFixPack V5.3.1.10, which causes applications to fail. V5.3.1.11\nresolves this issue. \n\n4800 - During instmqm, the script checks for the UNIX socket server.\nIn prior releases, in the event that this check failed, the\nerror message referred to the old UNIX socket server ($ZPMON).\nThis has been changed to refer to the new UNIX socket subsystem\n$ZLSnn, \"nn\" is the CPU number.\n\nAPAR IC85889 - UNEXPECTED IPC MESSAGES RECEIVED FOLLOWING PROCESS\nTERMINATION CAUSE EC TO ABEND REPEATEDLY\nIf a process sends an unexpected message to the MQECSVR\nprocess pair, the primary process will abend resulting in a\ntakeover by the backup process. The new primary process will\nthen abend. The only resolution is to restart the queue manager. \n\nAPAR IC87007 - PRIMARY QUEUE SERVER ABEND FOLLOWING TRANSACTION ABORT\nIn some circumstances, aborts of global units of work \ninvolving MQGETs of messages greater than 52k will result in an \nabend of the primary queue server responsible for the queue. \nThis renders the queue manager unresponsive \n\nAPAR IC87627 - WEBSPHERE MQ V5.3.1.8 FDC FILES DO NOT CONTAIN ENOUGH ERROR \nINFORMATION\n\nAPAR IC89128 - LISTENER FAILS TO START FOLLOWING UPGRADE TO \nHP J06.14/H06.25 OR T9050J01-AWT/T9050H02-AWS\nIn some configurations, the listener process will not run\nfollowing an upgrade to J06.14/H06.25 or the installation of \nT9050J01-AWT/T9050H02-AWS. The failure is dependent on the\nnumber of OSS processes running and their distribution between\nthe CPUs on the system.

The default size of the buffer is \n512K, this is sufficient for most configurations. If the buffer \nsize is insufficient, the queue manager reports FDCs from \nrrmHPNSSPutMetaPacket that indicate the present size of the\nbuffer and the size demanded.\n\nThe buffer size is configured using an environment variable, \nAMQ_CLUSTER_METABUFFER_KILOBYTES. To change the value, the \nenvironment variable should be specified in the \n\"RepositoryManager\" stanza of the qmproc.ini file of the queue\nmanager using the following syntax:\n\nEnv0n=AMQ_CLUSTER_METABUFFER_KILOBYTES=x\n\nWhere \"n\" is the number of the environment variable, and \"x\" is\nthe required new size of the buffer in kilobytes. In a default\nconfiguration, environment variables are not present in the \nRepositoryManager stanza, hence \"n\" will be 1. If the \nconfiguration has existing environment variables specified in\nthis stanza, the value of \"n\" selected should be the next \navailable value. \n\nAPAR IC75356 - Partial repository queue managers in complex configurations\nwhere applications connected to the partial repository queue\nmanager attempt to open large numbers of nonexistant objects\ncan suffer from a build up of subscription objects on the \nSYSTEM.CLUSTER.REPOSITORY.QUEUE such that the TMF lock limits\nfor the volume containing the queue file are breached when the\nqueue is reconciled.

This problem \nis seen with both distributed and cluster queue managers. \nMoreover, this problem does not occur prior to WMQ V5.3.1.5 \nrelease. A DELAY was introduced as part of an APAR(IC57744) fix\nin WMQ V5.3.1.5 release for mutli-threaded SSL channels which\ncaused this difference in measured response time. The problem is\nnow rectified in this release. \n\nAPAR IC67032 - Improvement to LQMA FDC during MQCONN processing. At times, when\napplication dies during MQCONN processing, LQMA's generate FDCs\nfor this rather unusual event to let the user take any \ncorrective action and/or find the root cause. The problem can \noccur with a standard bound application in a very narrow timing\nwindow when the application connects with the LQMA agent but \ndies before the LQMA gets a chance to read the incoming message\nfrom the application. When LQMA detects this situation, it \ncleans up and generates an FDC. But unfortunately, the FDC does\nnot contain the application information. To let the user \nidentify the mis-behaving application and to possibly take\ncorrective action, LQMA FDC will be updated to include \napplication information. The updated FDC will contain the\nfollowing information :\n\nComment1 :- Application died during MQCONN Processing.\nComment2 :- Application: <Application PID> \n\nAPAR IC67057 - Unused LQMA agents(processes or threads) are found during MQCONN \nprocessing. During MQCONN processing if a standard bound \napplication fails to connect successfully to an allocated LQMA\nprocess or thread (depending on your configuration), then that\nLQMA process or thread remains in a hanging state for ever and\ndo not get re-used by Execution Controller for any further \nMQCONN processing. If an LQMA agent process ever goes into this \n\"limbo\" state, ecasvc utility shows \n\"Allocated, Pending Registration\" flag if it is unthreaded LQMA \nor a positive number against \"Conns Pending\" flag if it is a \nmulti threaded LQMA. If this problem occurrs multiple times, \nthen depending on the user configuration, it might lead to LQMA \nresource problems where Execution Controller will run out of \navailable LQMA agents to serve application MQCONN requests.\n\nAPAR IC65966 - runmqsc <queue manager name> causes FDC on a CPU due to missing\nOSS shared memory files (shm.x.x) for that CPU. Due to a yet\nunknown reason, the queue manager shared memory files for a\nparticular CPU on the system are deleted even when the queue\nmanager is in running state. This prevents any new MQ connection\nrequests from succeeding for the same queue manager on the\naffected CPU. This patch contains changes that will better\nprotect WMQ shared memory files and will prevent accidental\ndeletion of files by WMQ programs. The changes in this patch\nwill also report any such incidence by producing FDC files. The\nFDC file produced by this detection mechanism will contain the\nfollowing information :\nComment1 :- xcsIC_QUEUE_MANAGER_POOL being destroyed.\n\nAPAR IC67569 - When WMQ Queue Server detects an error due to invalid context\ndata during the completion of a TMF transaction started by the\nQueue Server for a PUT or GET no-syncpoint persistent message\noperation, it marks the message on the queue object as \naccessible. This causes the Queue Server to FDC with \n\"Record not found\" on any subsequent MQGET operation to retrieve\nthe same message. The particular message on the queue that has \nthis problem remains in this limbo state forever and can not be\nretrieved. However other messages on the same queue that do not\nhave this problem can be retrieved without any problem using \ntheir msgids. The Queue Server has been revised to correct this\nbehavior such that detection of inconsistent context data during\nMQPUT/MQGET is logged in the form of an FDC but is otherwise \ncommitted as a normal operation. This will resolve the problem\nof MQGET failing on the retrieval of the message.\n\nAPAR IC68569 - Channel server FDCs during starting/stopping of channels. The \nproblem occurrs due to a defect in the product where the channel\nserver erroneously closes its open to Queue Server but assumes \nthat its open to Queue Server is valid. The open handle \nto Queue Server after it is closed, gets reused by another open\nand hence any subsequent communication by Channel Server to \nQueue Server always fails. Typically, this problem is seen when\nthe Channel Server experiences transient socket errors with the \nchannel agent (MCA) and it wants to close the socket connection.\nAfter closing the socket connection, Channel server sends a \nmessage to Execute Controller process to de-allocate the MCA\nwith which it had socket error with. It is during this \ncommunication between the Channel Server and the Execution\nController when the Channel Server erroneously closes the open\nto the Queue Server.\n\nAPAR IC69572 - Channel server abends due to illegal address reference during\nadopt MCA processing. This problem happens if the Queue Manager\nhas enabled adopt MCA processing to a remote WMQ Queue Manager\nthat does not send a remote queue manager name during channel\ninitialization/negotiation. The remote Queue Manager field\nremains NULL and during the Adopt MCA processing logic,\nthe channel server incorrectly references the NULL pointer and\nabends. \n\nAPAR IC69932 - SNA WMQ listener fails to start the channel when HP SPR \nT9055H07^AGN is present on the NonStop system. HP, in its SPR\nSPR T9055H07^AGN, changed the behavior of sendmsg() API if '-1'\nis used as a file descriptor to the API. This caused \nincompatibility with WMQ SNA listener process. WMQ code has now \nbeen revised to work with the updated sendmsg() behavior. \n\nAPAR IC69996 - WMQ Queue Server generates FDC with reply error 74. When an\napplication with a waiting syncpoint MQGET suddenly dies \nbefore getting a reply, the Queue Server can cause FDC \nsometimes. This happens in a narrow timing window when a message\nbecomes available on the queue and the Queue Server starts \nprocessing the waiting MQGET request. If the application dies\nafter Queue Server starts processing the waiting MQGET request, \nthen Queue Server detects the inherited TMF transaction error \nand replies back with error 2072 (MQRC_SYNCPOINT_NOT_AVAILABLE).\nHowever in this case, Queue Server erroneously does not delete\nits internal waiter record for MQGET. When the timer pops for\nthe waiter record, Queue Server attempts to reply back with\nno message available but the call to Guardian REPLYX procedure\nfails with error 74 as the reply to the same request has already\nbeen made(with error MQRC_SYNCPOINT_NOT_AVAILABLE). This causes\nthe Queue Server to FDC.\n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were\nalso released with V5.3.1.7:\n\n363 - WMQ Queue Server under certain conditions fails to handle non-persistent\nand persistent segmented messages at the same time.\n1317 - Support for parallel execution of multiple endmqm programs on the same\nQueue Manager. \n1404 - MQGET WAIT is not being rejected with error 2069 when there is an \nexisting MQGET set signal on the same queue handle. \n1434 - svcmqm utility fails when install files are open but does not tell the \nuser which files are open. \n1566 - svcmqm does not exit immediately when 'cp' command fails to copy \nbinaries during fixpack installation.\n1679 - WMQ Queue Server generates FDC while failing to open the message \noverflow file during retrieval of very large messages (equal to or \nlarger than 'Message Overflow Threshold' displayed with dspmqfls \nutility).\n1709 - instmqm changes related to the use of /opt directory for the creation of\nbackup archive file.\n1789 - Port of distributed APAR IY66826.

The\nleak is observed only when the NAMELIST(s) has one or more NAMES\nvalues defined. The problem is observed from within the runmqsc\nDISPLAY NAMELIST command, or from the PCF/MQIA equivalent. Tools\nthat request NAMELIST data via the command server with PCF/MQIA\nrequests such as WMQ Explorer will cause the WMQ command server\nmemory to grow.\n\nAPAR IC61324 - An orphan MCA problem occurs when a connection request from WMQ\nLISTENER or CHANNEL SERVER process to an MCA process fails. WMQ\nExecution Controller (EC) process fails to recognize the\nsituation and does not re-use the MCA process for future agent\nallocation requests. Over a period of time, this problem can\ncause the queue manager to run out of MCA resources which may\nlead to a situation where no new channel can be started. The\nproblem is observed during heavy load conditions where the WMQ\nExecution Controller(EC) process hands over a selected MCA\nprocess to LISTENER/CHANNEL SERVER before the MCA process\nbecomes ready to accept connection requests.\n\nAPAR IC61551 - The use of cluster administrative command\nRESET CLUSTER ACTION(FORCEREMOVE), to forcibly remove a Queue\nManager out of the cluster can cause FDCs. The problem can cause\nmultiple FDCs and sometimes abend in WMQ REPMAN process in a\nslave role. Once the command has been issued and the error has\noccurred, the concerned Queue Manager must be restarted to\nrestore the clustering function to normal operation. The problem\noccurs because WMQ REPMAN process in a master role does not\ndistribute the RESET CLUSTER ACTION(FORCEREMOVE) command to the\nslave REPMAN processes correctly.\n\nAPAR IC61651 - When a NAMELIST object with one or more NAMES values is defined\nfor a Queue Manager and a dspmqfls command is issued to retrieve\nthe details of either all objects under the Queue Manager or\nthe specific NAMELIST object, FDCs are seen from the WMQ LQMA\nprocess. The problem exists for both unthreaded and\nmulti-threaded LQMA process. The problem occurs because WMQ LQMA\nprocess does not allocate sufficient memory for NAMES buffer\nduring dspmqfls processing.\n\nAPAR IC61660 - A PCF RESET QUEUE STATISTICS command causes the WMQ QUEUE SERVER\nprocess to FDC. The problem occurs during a timing window when\nthere is an outstanding unit of work on the queue and a\nRESET QUEUE STATISTICS command is processed and then the\noutstanding unit of work is backed out. RESET QUEUE STATISTICS\ncauses certain internal counters inside WMQ QUEUE SERVER to be\nreset to zero without taking into account the outstanding unit\nof work. If the outstanding work is later backed out for any\nreason, the already reset counters become negative which causes\nan internal consistency check to fail within the QUEUE SERVER\nprocess and the FDC is generated.\n\nAPAR IC61681 - WMQ QUEUE SERVER causes FDC during MQCLOSE processing on a\ncluster alias queue. The problem occurs during MQCLOSE\nprocessing of a cluster QALIAS object hosted by a different\nQUEUE SERVER than that hosts the target local queue. MQOPEN\nincorrectly failed to allocate an internal handle for the QALIAS\nobject if it was a cluster alias queue. This lead to the FDC\nduring MQCLOSE processing.\n\nAPAR IC61846 - When a START CHANNEL command is issued after WMQ trace is\nenabled, the SSL channel logs a Queue Manager error message and\nfails to start.\nThe problem exists only for a SSL channel, no such problem\nis found for regular (non-SSL) channel. The problem occurs\nbecause of an incorrect implementation of NULL terminated string\nto store SSL Cipher data.\n\nAPAR IC61920 - WMQ on NonStop reports an extra EMS message when the generation\nof an FFST is reported.\nThe intention behind the second EMS message was to report the\ncase when the open of the generated FFST file fails but the\ncheck to see the status of the opened FFST files was missing\nin the code.\n\nAPAR IC62341 - A Security error from the WMQ OAM server is not propagated\ncorrectly. It was reported as MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_NAME instead\nof MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED. When running the Java IVP (MQIVP) to NSK\nwith a non-mqm user specified as the MCAUSER in the SVRCONN\nchannel, and if the non-mqm group isn't given authorization,\nMQIVP fails to connect to the Queue Manager\nwith an authorization failure (MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED) but it is\nreported incorrectly as a MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_NAME error.\n\nAPAR IC62389 - A REFRESH CLUSTER command within a cluster with more than two\nrepositories causes the Repository Manager to fail. The problem\nis not common in normal cluster operation but is likely if\nextensive administrative changes are being made to the cluster\nthat includes a REFRESH CLUSTER command. Incorrect distribution\nof channel status information across multiple copies of the\nREPOSITORY MANAGER cache in different CPUs of the system lead to\nthe FDC.\n\nAPAR IC62391 - Sometimes cluster queues are not visible on CPUs hosting WMQ\nREPOSITORY MANAGER process in a slave role. This is a cluster\nqueue visibility problem across the CPUs. Any attempt to open\nthe cluster queue on CPUs that have the visibility problem\nresults in error MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_NAME or\nMQRC_CLUSTER_RESOLUTION_ERROR.\nThe problem does not occur on the CPU that hosts WMQ REPOSITORY\nMANAGER process in a master role.\n\nAPAR IC62449 - The WMQ QUEUE SERVER does not log storage related problems to\nthe Queue Manager log. Some of NSK storage related errors like\nerror 43 and error 45 are useful errors for which corrective\naction can be taken to restore normal operation.\nThe WMQ QUEUE SERVER now logs these errors to Queue Manager log.\n\nAPAR IC62480 - Port of IZ51686. Incorrect cache object linkage causes\nunexpected failures (AMQ9456) based on coincidental event\nsequences.\n\nAPAR IC62511 - Port of the following clustering-related APARs from other\nplatforms and versions:\nIZ14399 - Queue managers successfully rejoin a cluster when\nAPAR IY99051 is applied but have mismatching sequence\nnumbers for the cluster queue manager object and its\nassociated clusters.\nIZ21977 - MQRC_OBJECT_CHANGED(2041),\nAMQ9511 SYSTEM.CLUSTER.TRANSMIT.QUEUE,AMQ9448,\nRepository manager ends.\nIZ37511 - Generation of an FDC by the Repository Manager causes\nit to terminate.\nIZ14977 - Missing cluster information when Namelists are used\nto add and remove queue managers from multiple\nclusters at once.\nIZ36482 - Changes to CLUSRCVR shared using a Namelist not\npublished to all clusters.\nIZ10757 - Repository Manager process terminates with error\nRRCI_CLUS_NO_CLUSRCVR_DEFINED.\nIZ41187 - MQRC_CLUSTER_PUT_INHIBITED was returned when an out-\ndated object definition from the cluster repository\nwas referenced.\nIZ34125 - MQ fails to construct and send an availability message\nwhen REFRESH CLUSTER REPOS (YES) is issued on a queue\nmanager with more than 1 CLUSRCVR.\n96181 - Object changed problems with the Repository manager.\nIY97159 - Repository Manager process tries to access the cache\nwhile restoring the cache, resulting in a hang.\nIZ44552 - AMQ9430 message after REFRESH CLUSTER.\n135969 - Refresh bit not set when demoting QM to partial repository.\n\nAPAR IC62850 - The md.Priority of a message was not being set to the queue\nDEFPRTY when a no syncpoint MQPUT is performed using\nMQPRI_PRIORITY_AS_Q_DEF while there is a waiting MQGET.\nA syncpoint MQPUT with a waiting MQGET does not have this\nproblem.\n\nAPAR IC63081 - A WMQ application abends in the MQI library when attempting to\nenqueue messages to a Distribution LIST with one queue entry.\nAlso in certain circumstances, WMQ applications may receive\nincorrect status and reason code while using Distribution LISTS.\n\nAPAR IC63105 - A Memory leak occurs in the WMQ COMMAND SERVER with repeated\nDISPLAY QSTATUS command. The leak is observed only when\nTYPE HANDLE is used with the above command. The problem also\noccurs from within runmqsc DISPLAY QSTATUS command, or from the\nPCF/MQIA equivalent. Tools that request queue status data via\nWMQ COMMAND SERVER with PCF/MQIA requests such as WMQ Explorer\nwill cause the WMQ COMMAND SERVER memory to grow.\n\nAPAR IC63271 - When an MQ application delays in replying to the HP system OPEN\nmessage from the WMQ QUEUE SERVER and an MQ message arrives on\nqueue during this period, the MQ message did not get delivered\neven after the reply to the HP system OPEN message is made.\n\nAPAR IC63757 - In a standard bound application, a memory leak occurs in WMQ\nLQMA process during MQCONN/MQDISC processing. The problem occurs\nwith both unthreaded and multi-threaded LQMA process. If the\nLQMA agents are configured to have high use count\n(MaxAgentUse for unthreaded LQMA and MaxThreadedAgentUse for\nmulti-threaded LQMA) and WMQ Execution Controller process\nre-uses the same LQMA process to satisfy a application MQCONN\nrequest, then the heap memory of LQMA process grows even if\napplication calls MQDISC to disconnect from the\nQueue Manager.\n\nAPAR IC64297 - WMQ Queue Manager becomes non-responsive because the\nWMQ QUEUE SERVER does not clean up the internal queue manager\nobject opens. The QUEUE SERVER internal links for\nMQOPEN of the Queue Manager object were not\nbeing released during the MQCLOSE processing. This causes a\nbuildup of QUEUE SERVER memory as the application repeated\nMQOPEN of the queue manager object repeatedly. When either\na MQDISC occurred or the application process ended,\nthe QUEUE SERVER cleans up its internal lists for the process.\nThis resulted in a perceived QUEUE SERVER loop and\nnon-responsive WMQ as there were\nover 246,000 opens found of the Queue Manager object with a\nhigh mark of 548,000 within the QUEUE SERVER when a dump of the\nQueue Server was analyzed.\nMQOPEN of other MQ objects (qlocal, qalias, qremote etc.) do not\nhave this issue.\n\nAPAR IC64373 - The COBOL copybook now includes missing definitions for MQGET\nSET SIGNAL processing.\n\nAPAR IC64435 - An incorrect persistence attribute was being set for a\nnon-persistent message on XMIT queue. When MQPUT of a\nnon-persistent message is done using MQPER_PERSISTENCE_AS_Q_DEF\nattribute to a remote queue while the channel is idle, the MD\nMD data in transmit queue header contained\nMQPER_PERSISTENCE_AS_Q_DEF value of (2).\n\nAPAR IC64630 - It takes longer for unthreaded SSL sender channel to end when\ncommunication to the remote Queue Manager is lost. The problem\noccurs because the unthreaded MCA process running the SSL channel\nfails to timeout correctly causing the channel to end differently\nthan non-SSL channels. The problem is observed only with SSL\nchannels and no such problem is visible with regular SSL \nchannels. \n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work are\nalso released with V5.3.1.6:\n\n1096 - An MQGET BROWSE operation can return prematurely with no message\navailable as well as can cause a waited GET to hang indefinitely.\n1513 - amqrrmit erroneously reports multiple master REPMAN processes.\n1587 - Enhancements to Execution Controller log messages pertaining to\nThreshold and MaxAgent capacity situations. For unthreaded agents,\nthe \"max unthreaded agents reached\" message will now be logged when the\nMaxUnthreadedAgent is allocated to perform work. In previous releases,\nthe message was logged when the MaxUnthreadedAgent was added to the idle\npool, which actually left one agent still available for use.\nFor threaded agents, messages have been enhanced to display separate\nThreshold/Maximum messages for agents and threads. In previous releases,\n\"further connections refused\" was displayed when the MaxThreadedAgent\nwas started, which actually left MaximumThreads connections still\navailable for use. In this release \"further connections refused\" will be\ndisplayed when the MaximumThread is allocated for use.\nAlso in this release, messages will be logged when the number of agents\nor threads, after having exceeded the threshold or reached maximum,\nfall below the Maximum or threshold limit.\n1669 - ZCG_FFST does not report the error code for a TMF error.\n1675 - The Execution Controller now provides an API to mark MCAs that are no\nlonger used.\n1670 - Correction to missing component data in a FDC generated by the\nQueue Manager server(MQS-QMGRSVR00) process(amqqmsvr).\n1678 - Queue server abends due to uninitialized FFST inserts.\n1706 - dmpmqaut -m <qmgr> sometimes only reports the first QALIAS object and\nFDCs in kpiEnumerateObjectAuthority.\n1710 - The Execution Controller sometimes allocates an MCA that it has\npreviously asked to end\n1712 - Cluster queue manager STATUS and queue visibility problems in slave\nREPMAN.\n1734 - Fixes/Updates to MQ tracing mechanism.\n1735 - Subscription id distribution.\n1751 - Fixes/Updates to MQ tracing mechanism.\n1807 - Changes to improve service and debug capability of Execution Controller\nstarted processes.\n1873 - \"*\" subscriptions are generated incorrectly causing them to be ignored.\n1989 - Fix for channel server hanging problem while opening REPMAN process.\n2003 - LQMA now FDCs when a invalid message is received.\n\nThe following serviceability fixes were made to the SDCP tool:\n\n1659 - sdcp is not capturing the PSTATE of backup processes.\n1676 - sdcp takes too long.\n1690 - sdcp MQ utilities are not using the correct Queue Manager name if\nthe name is mangled because of non-alphabetic characters.\n1702 - sdcp doesn't collect all relevant Saveabend files.\n1705 - sdcp workaround to avoid APAR IC61651.\n1971 - sdcp now gives correct output for default Queue Manager.\n\nThe following APAR fixes were released in V5.3.1.5:\n\nAPAR IC55607 - FDC files can fail to be written, or written to the wrong file\nFDCs can be suppressed or overwritten when application processes\nraise FDCs under User IDs that are not members of the MQM group.\nIn addition, because FDC files are named with the CPU and PIN of\nthe generating process, and PIN is reused frequently on\nHP NonStop Server, FDCs from different processes can be appended\nto the same file.\n\nThe format of the file name for FDCs is:\nAMQcccpppp.s.FDC\n\nwhere ccc is the CPU number\npppp is the PIN\ns is the sequence number\n\nIn V5.3.1.4 and earlier releases, the sequence number was\nalways set to 0. This fix introduces the use of the sequence\nnumber field to ensure that FDCs from different processes are\nalways written to different files, and that FDCs can always be\nwritten. FDC files are created with file\npermissions \"rw-r----\" to prevent unauthorized access to the\nFDC data.\n\nAPAR IC57435 - Attempts to end a queue manager with either -t or -p following\na cpu failure in some cases did not work as a result of\ndamage to the WMQ OSS shared memory files. The shared memory\nmanagement code was revised to tolerate OSS shmem/shm files\ncontaining invalid data. Invalid data in these files is now\nignored and memory segment creation will continue normally.\n\nAPAR IC58165 - Triggered channels sometimes do not trigger when they should\nSome attributes of a local queue that determine if trigger\nmessages get generated are not kept up to date for long-running\napplications. The most critical attribute is the GET attribute\nthat controls whether MQGET operations are enabled for a queue\nor not. If the application opened the triggered queue while\nthe queue was GET(DISABLED), and the queue is subsequently\nmodified to be GET(ENABLED), triggering will not occur when it\nshould.\n\nAPAR IC58377 - Trace data is not written when PIDs are reused for processes\nrunning under different User IDs.\nTrace files are named according to the CPU and PIN of the process\nthat is being traced. On HP NonStop Server, since PINs are\nrapidly reused, it is likely that a process attempting to write\ntrace data will encounter an existing file written with the same\nCPU and PIN. The traced process will be unable to write data if\nthe original file was written (and therefore owned) by a\ndifferent User ID.\n\nThis fix introduces a sequence number into the trace file names\nto prevent trace file name collisions.\n\nThe format of trace file names will change from:\n\nAMQccppppp.TRC to AMQccppppp.s.TRC\n\nwhere s is a sequence number that will usually be 0.\nTrace files are now created with file permissions \"rw-r----\"\nto prevent unauthorized access to the trace data.\n\nAPAR IC58717 - The Queue Server backup process generates FDCs showing ProbeId\nQS123006 from qslHandleChpPBC when attempting to locate a browse\ncursor message, with the comment text of\n\"Error locating Last Message in Browse Cursor checkpoint in\nBackup\" or \"Error locating Last Logical Message in Browse Cursor\ncheckpoint in Backup\". The problem appears only when running a\nnumber of parallel browse / get applications for the same queue\nobject.\n\nAPAR IC58792 - strmqm fails to delete orphaned temporary dynamic queues if the\nassociated touch file is missing. This results in these queues\nremaining in the object catalog indefinitely, and FDC files\nbeing generated each time the queue manager is started,\nreflecting the fact that the queue could not be deleted. The\nhousekeeping function was modified to always silently remove\ntemporary dynamic queue objects from the catalog, whether or\nnot they are damaged. FDC files are no longer generated.\n\nAPAR IC58859 - wmqtrig script does not pass TMC with ENVRDATA correctly.\nIf ENVRDATA is part of the PROCESS definiton used by\nrunmqtrm to trigger applications the TMC is not delivered to\nthe application correctly. The problem does not occur with\nblank ENVRDATA. Additionally, ENVRDATA or USERDATA attributes\nthat contain volume names ($DATA for example) are not processed\ncorrectly by the wmqtrig script.\n\nAPAR IC58891 - Sender channels that were running in a CPU that failed are not\nrestarted in some circumstances. Sender channels that are not\nrestarted report \"AMQ9604: Channel <...> terminated\nunexpectedly\" in the queue manager error log, and the channel\nserver create FDCs with ProbeID RM487001, Component\n\"rriChannelTerminate\".\n\nAPAR IC58976 - A server channel without a specified CONNAME enters a STOPPED\nstate when the MCA process running the channel is forcibly\nstopped or ends following a CPU failure. The channel state\nshould be set to INACTIVE following this type of event. To\nrecover the situation the channel has to be manually restarted\nor stopped using MODE(INACTIVE).\n\nAPAR IC59024 - The copyright data in the COBOL COPYBOOK CMQGMOL file\nis incorrect.\n\nAPAR IC59126 - Context data is missing in COA message.\nWhen an MQPUT application sends a message with COA report\noption, the generated replied COA message does not contain\ncontext data eg. PutDate, PutTime, etc.\n\nAPAR IC59364 - Queue Server primary incorrectly commits an WMQ message in\ncertain cases where the backup process has failed to process\nan internal checkpoint message. This causes an inconsistency\nbetween the primary and backup processes when an MQGET is\nattempted on this message, resulting in FDCs with the comment\ntext \"Invalid Message Header context in Backup for Get\" from\nComponent \"qslHandleGetCkp\". The queue object is no longer\naccessible via MQGETs, but can be recovered by stopping the\nbackup process.\n\nAPAR IC59388 - V5.3 OAM Implementation contains migration logic which may be\ntriggered erroneously in some circumtances, removing authority\nrecords from the SYSTEM.AUTH.DATA.QUEUE. This change removes the\nmigration logic, since there are no previous versions of the\nOAM which require migration.\n\nAPAR IC59395 - Threaded LQMA actual usage is one larger than the configured\nmaximum use count in the qmproc.ini file. Unthreaded LQMAs\nand MCAs (both threaded and unthreaded) do not suffer from this\nproblem.\n\nAPAR IC59428 - In some circumstances where connecting applications terminate\nunexpectedly during the MQCONN processing, either by external\nforcible termination, or as a consequence of other failures that\n\nresult in termination, the resulting error can cause the LQMA\nprocess handling the application to terminate. This will\ncause collateral disconnections of all other applications using\nthe same LQMA, with the application experiencing either a 2009\n(connection broken) or 2295 (unexpected) error. The problem\nwindow occurs only during one section of the connect protocol\nand has been observed only on very busy systems with repeated\nmultiple forced terminations of applications.\n\nAPAR IC59742 - qmproc.ini file will fail validation if configured with both\nMinIdleAgents=0 and MaxIdleAgents=0.\n\nAPAR IC59743 - Queue Manager server expiration report generation is not fully\nconfigurable. The frequency with which the queue manager server\ngenerates expiration reports is configurable but the number of\nreports generated is not. This change introduces a new\nenvironment variable (MQQMSMAXMSGSEXPIRE), to allow\nconfiguration of the number of expiration reports generated\nat any one time. The parameter can be added to the WMQ\nPathway MQS-QMGRSVR00 serverclass:\nALTER MQS-QMGRSVR00, ENV MQQMSMAXMSGSEXPIRE=<1-99999>\nIf this value is not specified in the queue manager\nserverclass configuration, the value defaults to 100.\n\nAPAR IC59802 - Memory leak occurs with repeated DIS CHSTATUS SAVED command.\nA memory leak exists in the Channel Saved Status query. This\nleak is observed within either the runqmsc DISPLAY CHSTATUS\n\nSAVED command, or the PCF/MQIA equivalent. Tools that request\nsaved channel status data via the Command Server with PCF / MQIA\nrequests such as WMQ Explorer will cause the Command Server\nmemory to grow.\n\nAPAR IC60114 - WMQ processes or user application processes generate FDCs\nreferring to \"shmget\" following forcible termination of the\nprocess or failure of the CPU running it. This is a result of\nthe Guardian C-files (Cnxxxxxx) for a CPU becoming corrupt\nduring an update operation, rendering the file and associated\nshared memory segment unusable. C-file update operations are\nnow performed atomically to prevent this problem.\n\nAPAR IC60135 - Improve servicability of the \"endmqm -i\" command to prevent the\ncommand from waiting indefinitely for the queue manager to end.\nFollowing this change after a specified number of seconds, the\ncommand will complete with the message \"Queue Manager Running\"\nand return to the command line with exit status 5.\n\nAPAR IC60175 - Description is not available (security/integrity exposure)\n\nAPAR IC60361 - Memory leak occurs in SVRCONN channel MCAs which repeatedly open\nlocal queue objects.\n\nAPAR IC60455 - WMQ Broker restart may not work correctly.\nIf the WMQ Broker is restarted using strmqbrk/endmqbrk,\nsubsequent attempts to restart the broker may fail, and 2033\nerrors my arise when running the test broker samples and\nrecycling the broker processes.\n\nAPAR IC60119 - System Administration manual incorrectly states the default\nvalue of the TCP/IP Keepalive is \"ON\"\n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were\nreleased with V5.3.1.5:\n\n1403 Erroneous SVRCONN channel ended message.\nSVRConn channels should not generate \"Channel Ended\" messages in\nthe error log, but in some circumstances, threaded svrconn\nchannels do generate these messages.\n1451 Internal changes relating to trace and FDC files sequence numbers\n1453 Problem with MQCONN after restart of broker\n1516 strmqm fails with invalid ExecutablePath attribute (qmproc.ini)\n1560 Port of V51 MQSeries for Compaq NonStop Kernel APAR IC57981.\nBackup Queue Server runs out of memory processing non-persistent\nmessages in 27K range. \n1564 runmqlsr abends in nssclose after a previous 'socket' calls fails\n1570 Added Agent type to EC logged threshold and max agent messages.\n1576 Change ECA interface to V4\n1577 Queue Server message expiration deletion phase log message\n1583 Blank channel status entries can get created triggering\nchannels when AdoptMCA is enabled.\nUnder certain timing situations, when triggered channels are\nused and AdoptMCA is enabled for the queue manager, blank\nchannel status entries can be created with the JOBNAME\nreferencing the Channel Initiator (runmqchi), for example:\nAMQ8417: Display Channel Status details.\nCHANNEL() XMITQ()\nCONNAME() CURRENT\nCHLTYPE() STATUS(BINDING)\nMSGS() BATCHES()\nJOBNAME(5,333 $MQCHI OSS(318898190)) RQMNAME()\nThis problem does not cause any immediate functional problem,\nhowever the blank entries consume channel status table entries\nand therefore could prevent legitimate channel starts in the\nevent that the status table becomes full.\n1594 C++ unthreaded libraries use threaded semaphores\n1596 Improved cs error reporting\n1597 EC started processes sometimes not started in intended CPU\n1598 NSS Incorrect component identifiers used in some parts of zig\n1608 Queue status errors on failure of a no syncpoint persist message\nput or get\n1601 Tracing details to the EC to augment the Entry and Exit trace\ncalls\n1611 LQMA Queue manager attribute corruption\n1613 Enhanced LEC Failure Handling\n1615 The EC may allow the os to choose in which cpu a MCA will start\n1616 Channel server comp traps have potential performance impact.\n1621 MQCONN does not report valid reason code when agent pool is full\n1622 After a channel is started dis chs displays \"binding\" in some\ncircumstances when it should display \"running\"\n1623 Incorrect message when MCA allocation fails\n1626 Addition of Service information collection tool (SDCP)\n\nNew platform support was released in V5.3.1.4:\n\nFixpack V5.3.1.4 introduced support for the HP Integrity NonStop BladeSystem\nplatform, NB50000c. Use the H-Series (Integrity) package of WebSphere MQ\nfor execution on the BladeSystem. Please refer to the Hardware and Software\nRequirements section for details about the levels of the J-Series software\nrequired.\n\nThe following APAR fixes were released in V5.3.1.4:\n\nAPAR IC57020 - runmqtrm does not function correctly and produces errors in some\ncases.\nWhen a triggered application is a guardian script file\n(ie filecode 101). runmqtrm produces an \"illegal program\nfile format\" error. Triggering also does not work correctly\nfor COBOL or TAL applications.\n\nAPAR IC57231 - The execution controller starts repository processes at the\nsame priority as itself in some cases, and does not take\naccount of the values set in the qmproc.ini file.\n\nAPAR IC57420 - Repository manager restart following failure causes cluster\ncache corruption in some circumstances.\nIf a repository manager abends while a queue manager is under a\nheavy load of cluster-intensive operations, in some\ncircumstances the repository manager that is restarted can\ndamage the cluster cache in the CPU in which it\nis running. This can prevent further cluster operations in that\nCPU and cause WMQ processes to loop indefinitely. This release\nchanges the repository startup to prevent this from happening.\n\nAPAR IC57432 - OSS applications that attempt to perform MQI operations from\nforked processes encounter errors.\nIf an oss WMQ application forks a child process, that child\nprocess will encounter errors if it attempts to perform MQI\noperations. Some operations may succeed, but will result\nin the generation of FDC files.\n\nAPAR IC57488 - MQMC channel menu display display error after channel is\ndeleted.\nIf a channel is deleted while the channel menu in MQMC\nis displayed, refreshing the channel menu produces the\nerror: \"Unknown error received from server. Error number\nreturned is 1\" and will not correctly display the channel\nlist without restarting MQMC.\n\nAPAR IC57501 - unthreaded sender channels to remote destinations with\nsignificant network latency may fail to start with timeout\nerrors.\n\nAPAR IC57524 - Applications launched locally from remote nodes cannot access\nsome of the queue manager shared memory files due to default\nsecurity on those files.\n\nAPAR IC57627 - Handling of TMF outages to improve operational predictability.\nIf TMF disables the ability to begin new transactions\n(BEGINTRANS DISABLED), WMQ does not always react in a\npredictable or easily diagnosed manner, and applications can\nsuffer a variety of different symptoms. If TMF is stopped\nabruptly (STOP TMF, ABRUPT) queue managers can become unstable\nand require significant manual intervention to stop and restart.\nRefer to item 18 in \"Known Limitations, Problems and\nWorkarounds\" later in this README for more information.\n\nAPAR IC57712 - altmqfls --qsize with more than 100 messages on queue fails.\nWhen a altmqfls --qsize is performed with more the 100 MQ\nmessages in the queue the processing fails.\n\nAPAR IC57719 - FDCs from MQOPEN when an error exists in alias queue manager\nresolution path. If a queue resolution path includes a queue\nmanager alias, and the target of the alias does not exist,\nthis will produce an FDC, rather than just failing the\nMQOPEN as would be expected.\n\nAPAR IC57744 - CPU goes busy when stopping a threaded SSL receiver channel\nusing MODE(TERMINATE).\nIf a stop channel mode(terminate) is used to stop an SSL\nreceiver channel that is running in a threaded MCA, the CPU\nwhere the MCA is running in begin using large amounts of CPU\ntime (95% range). This is due to a problem in the threads\nlibrary.\n\nAPAR IC57876 - Very infrequently, messages put via threaded LQMAs can in some\ncircumstances contain erroneous CCSID information. This has\nbeen observed to cause conversion errors if the message is\ndestined for a channel that has the CONVERT(YES) set.\nUnthreaded LQMAs do not suffer from this problem.\n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were\nalso released with V5.3.1.4:\n\n993 - Due to the way that default file security was used, file security for\ncertain shared memory files used by the queue manager (SZ***) may\n\ninadvertently change in a way that prevents applications not in\nthe mqm group from issuing MQCONN. File permissions were rationalised\nin this release to reflect those used for other shared memory files.\n1458 - Resolve Channel command generates FFSTs.\nWhen resolving In-Doubt channels, FFSTs were generated by the Channel\nServer and the MCA. Although the channels were successfully resolved,\nthe In-Doubt status in a DIS CHS query was not correctly updated.\nWhen resolving In-Doubt channels using the COMMIT option the following\nerror message was displayed \"AMQ8101: WebSphere MQ error (7E0) has\noccurred.\"\n1493 - The validation of the qmproc.ini file does not report the error case\nwhere multiple ChannelsNameMatch entries are specified ChlRule1.\n1498 - Instmqm does not support installation of the product on\nIntegrity NonStop BladeSystem platforms.\n1507 - Some Execution controller messages were missing \"Action\" descriptions\nwhen reported in the error log.\n1517 - In the qmproc.ini file, the AppRule4-SubvolMatch argument was not\nworking\n1522 - Communications Component Function ids and probes are incorrect. This\nresulted in misleading or missing information in trace files generated\nfor support purposes.\n1546 - MQBACK operation incorrectly reports error during broker operations\n1549 - Channel Server doesn't shutdown after takeover.\nIf the Primary Channel Server process is prematurely ended, for\nexample by a CPU crash, the Backup Channel Server process becomes the\nnew Primary process. Subsequent attempts to use endmqm will hang\nbecause the new Primary Channel Server process will not end.\n\n\nThe following documentation APARs are addressed by the V5.3.1.4 readme:\n\nAPAR IC55404 - REFRESH QMGR PCF command is not documented in the Programmable\n\ncommand formats manual.\n\nAlso - please check the \"Limitations\" and \"Known Problems and Workarounds\"\nsections later on in this readme for updates.\n\nThe following APAR fixes were released in V5.3.1.3:\n\nAPAR IC54305 - The HP TNS (non-native) C compiler generates Warning 86 when\ncompiling MQI applications\nAPAR IC55501 - The altmqfls command does not return the correct completion\nstatus; it always returns success\nAPAR IC55719 - Non-native MQINQ binding does not deal with some null pointer\nparameters correctly\nAPAR IC55977 - Channel retry does not obey SHORTTMR interval accurately enough\nAPAR IC55990 - Trigger data changes not being acted upon if they were made\nwhile the queue was open, leading to incorrect triggering\nbehavior\nAPAR IC56277 - Command Server can loop with INQUIRE QS command with a single\nparameter\nAPAR IC56278 - A remote RUNMQSC DIS QS command always times out\nAPAR IC56309 - MCAs do not disconnect from some shared memory when ending,\nwhich causes a slow memory leak, and under some conditions an\nabend\nAPAR IC56458 - Channel Server loops after installing V5.3.1.2 due to corrupt\ndata on SYSTEM.CHANNEL.SYNCQ\nAPAR IC56493 - Cannot use \"qualified\" hometerm device names with V5.3.1.2\nAPAR IC56503 - Channel Server and MCA can deadlock after repeated STOP CHANNEL\nMODE(FORCE) or MODE(TERMINATE) commands\nAPAR IC56536 - Unthreaded responder channels don't de-register from the EC when\nan error occurs during or before channel negotiation.

Reload CPUs.\n\nIf you use SNA channels with V5.3.1, we recommend the latest levels of the\nHP SNAX or ACI Communication Services for Advanced Networking (ICE) be used\nfor the SNA transport. The following versions were verified by IBM with this\nrelease of WMQ:\n\nACI Communication Services for Advanced Networking (ICE)\n- v4r1 on both HP Integrity NonStop Server and S-Series systems\n\nHP SNAX\n- T9096H01 on HP Integrity NonStop Server (H-Series) systems\n\nIf you use the WebSphere MQ V5.3 classes for Java and JMS for HP NonStop Server\nyou will need to install HP NonStop Server for Java Version 1.4.2 or later.\nThe Java.pdf supplemental document in the <install_path>/opt/mqm/READMES/en_US\ndirectory has been updated in this release. Java/JMS users should review the \nupdated document.\n\nUpgrading to V5.3.1.12\n---------------------\n\nFor systems running H Series operating systems, you may upgrade\nany prior service level of WebSphere MQ V5.3.1.x for HP NonStop Server to\nV5.3.1.12 level using this release. For NonStop BladeSystem running J series\noperating systems, you may upgrade from version V5.3.1.4 only, since V5.3.1.4\nis the earliest supported version on J series. If you need to perform a full\ninstallation on a J series system from the original installation media, see the\nsection later in this readme file for instructions.\n\nThe installation tool, svcmqm, is used to upgrade existing installations\nto this level. Additionally, the placed files for any prior level of V5.3.1\ncan be overlaid with the new files from V5.3.1.12 and then instmqm can be used\nto create new installations at the updated V5.3.1.12 level.\n\nYou must end all queue managers and applications in an installation if you\nwant to upgrade that installation to V5.3.1.12.\n\nYou do not need to re-create any queue managers to upgrade to V5.3.1.12.\nExisting queue managers (at any V5.3.1.x service level) will work with\nV5.3.1.12 once an installation has been properly upgraded.\n\nIf you use SSL channels, and are upgrading from WMQ V5.3.1, you must perform\na small reconfiguration of the Certificate store before running any SSL\nchannels after you have upgraded. The steps that are required are described\nbelow in the Post-Installation section. If you do not perform this\nreconfiguration, SSL channels in the upgraded V5.3.1.12 installation will\nfail with the log messages similar to the following:\n\nFor sender channels:\n\n09/29/07 08:52:43 Process(0,483 $Z8206) User(MQM.ABAKASH) Program(amqrmppa)\nAMQ9621: Error on call to SSL function ignored on channel\n'ALICE_BOB_SDRC_0000'.\n\nEXPLANATION:\nAn error indicating a software problem was returned from a function which is\nused to provide SSL support.

However, \nIBM strongly recommends that if you are upgrading from a release prior to \n5.3.1.7, you review the impact of APARs IC67057 and IC68569 that were fixed in\nthe V5.3.1.7 release. Please also note internal defect 4158 that is fixed in \nV5.3.1.11. The IC67057, IC68569 and internal defect 4158 fixes will not be \neffective in non-native applications unless the applications are relinked \nusing the HP BIND utility. \n\nb) If upgrading from V5.3.1.4 or earlier releases (including patch releases) :\n\nYou MUST use the HP BIND utility to relink any non-native applications prior\nto using them with V5.3.1.12. If an application is not re-bound with the \nV5.3.1.12 WMQ product, MQCONN API calls will fail with a MQRC 2059 and the \nWMQ EC process will output an FDC when the MQI incompatibility is detected, \nas follows:\n\nProbe Id :- EC075003\nComponent :- ecaIsECup\nComment1 :- Application MQ API not compatible, relink application\nComment2 :- <process cpu,pid process name>\nComment3 :- <application executable name>\n\nInstallation from Electronic Software Download H or J Series based systems\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThese instructions apply to installing WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server,\nVersion 5.3.1.12, from the package downloaded from IBM. Please note the\nadditional restrictions for upgrading J Series systems to this version.\n\nUse svcmqm to update an existing installation from the V5.3.1.12 placed files.\n\n1. Unzip the fixpack distribution package - wmq53.1.12.tar.zip.\nThe fixpack distribution package contains the following files:\n\nreadme_wmq_5.3.1.12 - this README\nwmq53.1.12_H07.tar.Z - H-Series H06 Package\n\n2. Identify the correct fixpack package to install:\n\nFor H-Series (H06) or J-Series systems (J06) use: wmq53.1.12_H06.tar.Z\n\n3. Upload the compressed fixpack archive to the OSS file system in binary mode.\nYou may wish to store the compressed archive, and the expanded contents\nin a location where you archive software distributions from IBM.\nIf you do this, you should store the compressed archive in a directory\nthat identifies the version of the software it contains,\nfor example, \"V53112\".\n\nmkdir -p /usr/ibm/wmq/V53112\nupload (in binary mode) the correct compressed tarfile to this directory\n\n4. Extract the fixpack compressed tarfile using commands similar to:\n\ncd /usr/ibm/wmq/V53112\nuncompress wmq53.1.12_H06.tar.Z\n\ntar xvof wmq53.1.12_H06.tar\n\n5. Locate your WMQ V5.3.1.x installation(s). The service installation procedure\nrequires the full OSS path names of the opt/mqm and var/mqm directories for\neach WMQ installation to which the fixpack will be installed.\n\n6. Logon to OSS using the WMQ installation owner's userid\n\n7. End all Queue Managers defined in the WMQ Installation.\nendmqm <qmgr name>\n\nEnsure all Queue Managers defined in the WMQ installation\nare ended.\ndspmq\n\nEnsure that the WMQ installation is at a suitable V5.3.1 level.\nmqver -V\nSee later notes concerning version requirements for NonStop BladeSystem\ninstallation.\n\n8. End any non-Pathway listeners for Queue Managers defined in the\nWQM installation:\nendmqlsr -m <qmgr name>\n\n9. Verify that no files in the Guardian subvolumes of the installation to\nbe updated are open. The installation cannot proceed safely unless all\nfiles in these subvolumes are closed. Use the TACL command 'FUP LISTOPENS'\nfor the files in all three subvolumes - an absence of output indicates\nthat no files are open. If files are shown to be open, use the output\nfrom the command to identify processes that are holding files open.\n\n\n10. Backup your WMQ Installation; the fixpack cannot be uninstalled.\ninstmqm -b can be used to back up an installation. Please refer\nto the readme file included with release WMQ V5.3.1.\n\n11. Install the fixpack by running the supplied service tool (svcmqm).\nSvcmqm requires the location of the OSS var tree as well\nas the OSS opt tree. These locations can be supplied automatically by\nrunning svcmqm in an OSS shell where the environment variables for the\nWMQ installation being updated have been established (typically by\nsourcing \"wmqprofile\"). If this is the case, svcmqm does not require the\n-i and -v parameters. \n\nFor example:\ncd /usr/ibm/wmq/V53112\nopt/mqm/bin/svcmqm -s /usr/ibm/wmq/V53112/opt/mqm\n\nIf the environment variables for the WMQ installation are not established in \nthe environment of svcmqm or if you want to update a WMQ installation other\nthan the one that your current WMQ environment variable points to, then \nthe locations of the OSS opt and var trees must be supplied explicitly using\nthe svcmqm command line parameters -i and -v.\n\nFor example:\n\ncd /usr/ibm/wmq/V53112\nopt/mqm/bin/svcmqm -s /usr/ibm/wmq/V53112/opt/mqm\n-i /wmq1/opt/mqm\n-v /wmq1/var/mqm\n\nsvcmqm will prompt to confirm the location of the OSS opt tree for the\ninstallation to be updated.\nType \"yes\" to proceed.\n\nSvcmqm will then update the installation. The current WMQCSTM file for\nthe installation will be renamed to BWMQCSTM as a backup copy, before it\nis regenerated. Note that any changes to the WMQCSTM file you have made\nwill not be copied to the new WMQCSTM file, however they will be preserved\nin the backup copy made before the WMQCSTM file was regenerated.\n\n12. Repeat Steps 5-11 for any other WMQ installations that you want to update\nwith this fixpack.\n\n13. You can install this fixpack in the WMQ placed installation files so that\nany future WMQ product installations will include the fixpack updates.\n\nTo do this, locate your WMQ placed installation filetree containing the\nopt directory, make this your current working directory (use 'cd') and\nthen unpack the contents of the tar archive for this fixpack over the placed\nfile tree. For example, if the placed files are located in the default\nlocation /usr/ibm/wmq/V531, for a H-Series system:\n\ncd /usr/ibm/wmq/V531\ntar xvof /usr/ibm/wmq/V5319/wmq53.1.12_H06.tar\n\nInitial Installation on a NonStop BladeSystem\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThese instructions apply to installing WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server on\na NonStop BladeSystem using the original installation media, in conjunction\nwith the 5.3.1.12 package downloaded from IBM. NonStop BladeSystem platforms\nare not supported prior to V5.3.1.4, and a \"from scratch\" installation requires\neither V5.3.1.4 or later files to be overlaid on a set of placed files\nfrom the base product media prior to performing the installation.\nYou do NOT need to perform these steps if you have already installed V5.3.1.4\non your NonStop BladeSystem. In this case, follow the standard installation\nsteps earlier in this readme file.\n\n1. Place the files for the Refresh Pack 1 (5.3.1.0) version of WebSphere MQ\n\nfor HP NonStop Server on the target system. Refer to the \"File Placement\"\nsection in Chapter 3 of the \"WebSphere MQ for NonStop Server Quick\nBeginnings\" guide. Pages 11-13 describes how to place the files.\nDo not attempt to install the placed files using the instmqm script\nthat was provided with V5.3.1.0 at this time. The V5.3.1.0 version of\ninstmqm does not support installation on NonStop BladeSystem.\n\n2. Unzip the 5.3.1.12 fixpack distribution package - wmq53.1.12.tar.zip.\nThe fixpack distribution package contains the following files:\n\nreadme_wmq_5.3.1.12 This README\nwmq53.1.12_H06.tar.Z H-Series H06 Package\n\n3. This installation requires the wmq53.1.12_H06.tar.Z package.\nLocate the WMQ placed installation filetree containing the opt directory\nprepared in step 1 above, and upload the wmq53.1.12_H06.tar.Z fixpack\narchive to this location in binary mode.\n\n4. Extract the fixpack compressed tarfile using commands similar to:\n\ncd /usr/ibm/wmq/V53112\nuncompress wmq53.1.12_H06.tar.Z\n\n5. Unpack the contents of the extracted tar archive for this FixPack over the\nplaced file tree. For example, if the placed files are located in the default\nlocation /usr/ibm/wmq:\n\ncd /usr/ibm/wmq\ntar xvof /usr/ibm/wmq/V53112/wmq53.1.12_H06.tar\n\n6. Use the extracted instmqm script in this FixPack to install the product\nusing the updated installation file tree and the instructions in Chapter 3\nof \"WebSphere MQ for NonStop Server Quick Beginnings\" guide, pages 13-29.\nBefore beginning, review the list of changes to Chapter 3 detailed in the\n\"Documentation Updates\" section at the end of this README file. Note also\nthat the list of installed files displayed will differ from those shown in the\nexamples in the manual.\n\nPost-Installation\n-----------------\nIf upgrading from WMQ V5.3.1, read the following post-installation instructions:\n\nNon-Native TNS Applications:\n\nRe-BIND any non-native (TNS) applications. See \"Upgrading to V5.3.1.12\" above \nfor more information.\n\nRe-binding non-native (TNS) is REQUIRED if upgrading from V5.3.1.4 or earlier\nreleases but is RECOMMENDED if upgrading from V5.3.1.5 or later fixpack for \nincorporation of APARs IC67057, IC68569 and internal defect 4158. \n\nIf you use SSL channels and have not already installed V5.3.1.1:\n\nEdit the SSL certificate store, cert.pem and move all the CA certificates\nto a new file, trust.pem, stored in the same directory as cert.pem. The\nonly items that should remain in cert.pem are the queue manager's personal\ncertificate, and the queue manager's private key. These two items should\nbe located at the start of the cert.pem file. All other certificates\n(intermediate and root CAs) must be moved to trust.pem. The trust.pem file\nmust be in the same directory as cert.pem, as configured in the queue\nmanager's SSLKEYR attribute.\n\nUpdate the copy of the entropy daemon program that you run for SSL channels\non the system with the new version (...opt/mqm/ssl/amqjkdm0).\n\nEnable new support for Danish CCSID 65024:\n\nCustomers who wish to enable the new support for Danish CCSID 65024\nshould do the following to install the revised ccsid.tbl file:\n\nIssue the following commands on OSS:\n\n1. Logon to OSS using the WMQ installation owner's userid\n2. End all Queue Managers defined in the WMQ Installation.\nendmqm <qmgr name>\n3. Source in the installation's wmqprofile\n. $MQNSKVARPATH/wmqprofile\n4. cp -p $MQNSKOPTPATH/samp/ccsid.tbl $MQNSKVARPATH/conv/table/\n5. Start queue managers\n\nGuardian C++ DLLs:\n\nEnsure that the WMQ Guardian C++ DLLs are 'executable' by using \"FUP ALTER\"\nto set their FILECODE to 800 (for H-Series or J-Series). Use commands similar \nto the following:\n\n1. Logon to TACL using the WMQ installation owner's userid\n\n2. OBEY your WMQ Installation's WMQCSTM file\n3. VOLUME [#param MQNSKOPTPATH^LIB^G]\n4. FUP ALTER IMQI2,CODE 800\n5. FUP ALTER IMQI2T,CODE 800\n6. FUP ALTER IMQI3,CODE 800\n7. FUP ALTER IMQI3T,CODE 800\n8. Logoff\n\nGuardian Subvolume File Permissions\n\nThe WMQ Guardian Installation Subvolume and all WMQ Guardian Queue\nManager Subvolumes must accessible to both MQM group members\nand to users that run WMQ application programs.\n\nEnsure that:\n\nAll members of the MQM security group have read, write, execute\nand purge permission to these subvolumes.\n\nAll users that run WMQ application programs, have read, write\nand execute permission to these subvolumes\n\nRestart Queue Managers:\n\nRestart the queue managers for the installation you have\nupdated with this fixpack.\n\nUNINSTALLATION INFORMATION\n==========================\n\nThis fixpack cannot be automatically uninstalled if a problem occurs\nduring the update of an installation using svcmqm.\n\nYou should use the instmqm -b option to create a backup of an\ninstallation before applying the service. If a problem occurs\nor you need to reverse the upgrade at a later date, use the\ninstmqm -x option to restore a backup of the installation at the\nprior service level.\n\nKNOWN LIMITATIONS, PROBLEMS AND WORKAROUNDS\n===========================================\n\nThis section details known limitation, problems, and workarounds for\nWebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server, Version 5.3.1.12.\n\nLimitations\n-----------\n\n1. The current implementation of Publish / Subscribe is restricted to run\nwithin a single CPU. The control program and all \"worker\" programs run in\nthe CPU that was used to run the 'strmqbrk' command.\nThe Publish/Subscribe broker does not automatically recover in the event\nof CPU failures.\n\n2. The current memory management implementation in the Queue Server limits\nthe total amount of non-persistent message data that can be stored on all\nthe queues hosted by a single Queue Server to less than 1Gb. The limit of\nnon-persistent message data on a single queue can not exceed approximately\n1Gb therefore, even if a single Queue Server is dedicated to that queue.\n\n3. The number of threads in threaded agent processes (LQMAs or MCAs) or in MQI\napplications, is limited to a maximum of 1000 by the limit on open depth of\nthe HP TMF T-file.\n\n4. API exits are not supported for non-native (TNS) applications. Any other\nexit code for non-native applications must be statically bound with the\nTNS application.\n\n5. Cluster workload exits are only supported in \"trusted\" mode. This means\nthat a separate copy of each exit will run in each CPU and exit code in\none CPU cannot communicate with exit code in another CPU using the normal\nmethods provided for these exits.\n\n6. Upgmqm will not migrate the following data from a V5.1 queue manager:\nmessages stored in Message Overflow files (typically persistent messages\nover 200,000 bytes in size) will not be migrated. If the option to\nmigrate message data was selected, the upgrade will fail. if the option\nto migrate message data was not selected, the upgrade will not be\naffected by the presence of message overflow files.\nclustering configuration data - all cluster related attributes of objects\nwill be reset to default values in the new V5.3 queue manager.\nSNA channel configuration - channels will be migrated, but several of the\nattributes values will need to be changed manually after the upgrade.\nchannel exit data - attributes in channels that relate to channel exit\nconfiguration will be reset to default values in the new V5.3 queue\nmanager.\nIn all cases where upgmqm cannot migrate data completely, a warning message\nis generated on the terminal output as well as in the log file. These can\nbe reviewed carefully after the upgrade completes for further actions that\nmay be necessary.\n\n7. Java and JMS limitations\n\nThe Java and JMS Classes do not support client connections. WebSphere MQ\nfor HP NonStop Server does not support XA transaction management, so the\nJMS XA classes are not available. For more detail, please refer to the\nJava and JMS documentation supplement, Java.pdf.\n\n8. Control commands in Guardian (TACL) environment do not obey the RUN option\n\"NAME\" as expected\n\nA Guardian control command starts an OSS process to run the actual\ncontrol command - and waits for it to complete. When the NAME option is\nused, the Guardian control command process uses the requested name, but\nthe OSS process cannot and is instead named by NonStop OS.\n\nIf the Guardian control command is prematurely stopped by the operator\n(using the TACL STOP command for example) the OSS process running the\nactual control command may continue to run. The OSS process may need to be\nstopped separately and in addition to the Guardian process.\n\n9. Trace doesn't end automatically after a queue manager restart\n(APAR IC53352) and trace changes do not take effect immediately\n\nIf trace is active and a queue manager is restarted, the trace settings\nshould be reset to not trace any more. Instead, the queue manager\ncontinues tracing using the same options as before it was restarted.\nThe workaround is to disable trace using endmqtrc before ending, or while\nthe queue manager is ended.\n\nAlso, changes to trace settings do not always take effect immediately\nafter the command is issued. For example, it could be several MQI calls\nlater that the change takes effect. The maximum delay between making a\ntrace settings change and the change taking effect would be until the end\nof the queue manager connection, or the ending of a channel.\n\n10. Some EMS events generated to default collector despite an alternate\ncollector being configured (APAR IC53005)\n\nAn EMS event message \"FFST record created\" is generated using the OSS\nsyslog() facility whenever an FDC is raised by a queue manager. This\nEMS event cannot be disabled, and goes to the default collector $0. For\nOSS processes, an alternate collector process can be specified by\nincluding an environment variable in the context of these processes\nas in the following example:\n\nexport EMS_COLLECTOR=\\$ALT\n\nGuardian processes always use the default collector because HP do not\nprovide the ability to modify the collector in the Guardian environment.\nHP is investigating if a change is possible. No fix for this problem\nhas yet been identified.\n\n11. The use of SMF (virtual) disks with WMQ is not supported on Release\nVersion Updates prior to H06.26 and J06.15 because of restrictions\nimposed by the OSS file system. For more details, please refer to the\nHP NonStop Storage Management Foundation User's Guide Page 2-12.\n\n12. The maximum channel batch size that can be configured (BATCHSZ attribute)\nis 2000. If you need to run channels with batch sizes greater than 680\nyou must increase the maximum message length attribute of the\nSYSTEM.CHANNEL.SYNCQ to 60000.\n\ne.g. from RUNMQSC - ALTER QL (SYSTEM.CHANNEL.SYNCQ) MAXMSGL (60000)\n\n13. The SYSTEM.CHANNEL.SYNCQ is a critical system queue for operation of\nthe queue manager and should not be altered to disable MQGET or MQPUT\noperations, or to reduce the maximum message size or maximum depth\nattributes from their defaults.\n\n14. Currently, the cluster transmission queue (SYSTEM.CLUSTER.TRANSMIT.QUEUE)\ncannot be moved to an alternative Queue Server because it is constantly\nopen by several internal components. The following procedure (which\nrequires a \"quiet\" queue manager, and a queue manager restart) can be\nused to achieve this reconfiguration. Do not use this procedure on a\nqueue manager that is running in production. Read and understand the\nprocedure carefully first since it includes actions that cause\ninternal errors to be generated in the queue manager.\n\n1/ Rename the OSS repository executable (opt/mqm/bin directory)\nmv amqrrmfa amqrrmfax \n2/ From OSS enter 'ps -f | grep amqrrmfa | grep X '\nwhere X is the Queue Manager name.\n3/ kill -9 those processes returned from step 2\nAt this point the EC will start continuously generating FDCs and\nlog messages as it attempts to, and fails, to restart the repository\nservers that were stopped. Perform the remaining steps in this\nprocedure without delay to avoid problems with excessive logging\nsuch as disk full conditions.\n4. Verify the processes are stopped\nFrom OSS enter 'ps -f | grep amqrrmfa | grep X '\nWhere X is the Queue Manager name\n5. Issue the altmqfls --server command to move the cluster transmission\nqueue to an alternate queue server\n6. Issue dspmqfls to verify the alternate server assignment\n7. Rename the OSS repository executable back to the expected name\nmv amqrrmfax amqrrmfa\n8. End the queue manager using preemptive shutdown. The EC will generate\nFDCs ending because of the earlier attempts to start a repository\nmanager while the executable was renamed. There will be FDCs and\nEC Primary process failover\n\nComponent :- xcsExecProgram\nProbe Description :- AMQ6025: Program not found\nComment1 :- No such file or directory\nComment2 :- /opt/mqm/bin/amqrrmfa\n...\nAMQ8846: MQ NonStop Server takeover initiated\nAMQ8813: EC has started takeover processing\nAMQ8814: EC has completed takeover processing\n...\nThe EC may have to be manually TACL stopped if quiesce or immediate\nend is used thus the need for the preemptive shutdown\nendmqm -p <qmgr name>\n9. Rename the repository manager executable to the original name\nmv amqrrmfax amqrrmfa\n10. Restart the queue manager\nstrmqm <qmgr name>\n\n15. In Guardian/TACL environments, support for some WMQ command-line programs\nhas been deprecated for WMQ Fixpack 5.3.1.3 and later.\n\nThe affected command-line programs are:\n\namqoamd\namqrdbgm\namqrfdm\ncrtmqcvx\nendmqlsr\nrunmqchi\nrunmqchl\nrunmqdlq\nrunmqlsr\nrunmqtrm\n\nThese programs will continue to function for now, however their use in\nGuardian/TACL environments is discouraged. Support for these programs\nin Guardian/TACL environments may be withdrawn completely in a future\nWMQ 5.3 release/fixpack.\n\nIBM recommends that customers use the OSS version of these programs instead.\n\nCustomers who want to route output from WMQ OSS tools to VHS or other Guardian\ncollectors should use the OSSTTY utility. OSSTTY is a standard utility\nprovided by OSS and is described in the HP publication \"Open System Services\nManagement and Operations Guide\".\n\nNote: See Item 3. in \"Known problems and workarounds\" for a description of\nrestrictions when using the MQ Broker administration commands in the\nGuardian/TACL environment.\n\n16. Do not use WebSphere MQ with a $CMON process that alters attributes of WMQ\nprocesses (for example the processor, priority, process name or program\nfile name) when they are started. This is not a supported environment since\nthere are components in WMQ that rely on these attributes being set as\nspecified by WMQ for their correct operation.\n\n17. Support for forked processes\n\nMQI Support from forked processes in OSS is subject to the following\nrestrictions:\n1. If forking is used, MQI operations can be performed only from child\nprocesses. Using MQI verbs from a parent process that forks child\nprocesses is not supported and will result in unpredictable\nbehavior.\n\n2. Use of the MQI from forked processes where the parent or child is\nthreaded is not supported.\n\n18. TMF Outage handling\n\nTMF outage handling was significantly improved with V5.3.1.4, however there\nis still a limitation in V5.3.1.6 and later to be aware of:\n\n1. If a STOP TMF, ABRUPT command is issued, TMF marks all open audited\nfiles as corrupt and the queue manager cannot perform further\nprocessing until this condition is rectified by restarting TMF.\nIn this state, the queue manager will freeze further operation, and log\nthe condition in the queue manager log file every 10 seconds for a\nmaximum of 50 attempts. Whether or not TMF is restored within this\ntimeframe, the WMQ queue manager should be restarted to reduce the risk\nof any undetected damage persisting.\n\n19. Triggering HP NSS non-C Guardian applications\n\nThe MQ default Trigger Monitor process, runmqtrm, at present cannot\ndirectly trigger the following application types:\n\nGuardian TACL scripts or macro file\nCOBOL application\nTAL application\nAn OSS script file (wmqtrig) provides indirect support for these\nfiles types. To use this script, the PROCESS definition APPLTYPE should\nbe set to UNIX, and the APPLICID should refer to the script as in\nthe following examples:\n\nFor a TACL script called \"trigmacf\":\nAPPLICID('/opt/mqm/bin/wmqtrig -c \\$data06.fp4psamp.trigmacf')\nAPPLTYPE(UNIX)\n\nFor a COBOL or TAL application called \"mqsecha\":\nAPPLICID('/opt/mqm/bin/wmqtrig -p /G/data06/fp4psamp/mqsecha')\nAPPLTYPE(UNIX)\n\n\nNotes:\n1. TACL scripts use the wmqtrig script with a \"-c\" option.\nThe -c option should use the Guardian representation for file name\nof the TACL script file, with the special character ($) escaped,\nfor example:\n\n\\$data06.fp4psamp.trigmacf\n\n2. COBOL and TAL applications use the wmqtrig script with a \"-p\" option.\nThe -p option must use the OSS representation for the file name of\nthe application, for example:\n\n/G/data06/fp4psamp/mqsecha\n\n3. C applications can be triggered directly by specifying\n\nAPPLICID('$DATA06.FP4PSAMP.MQSECHA')\nAPPLTYPE(NSK)\n\nTo trigger a PIC application using the WMQ Pathway MQS-TRIGMON00\nserverclass, a DEFINE is required:\n\n=_RLD_LIB_PATH,CLASS SEARCH,SUBVOL0 <Guardian MQ binary Volume.Subvolume>\n\nFor example:\nALTER MQS-TRIGMON00,\nDEFINE =_RLD_LIB_PATH,CLASS SEARCH,SUBVOL0 $DATA06.FP4PBIN\n\n4. If the \"-p\" option is used, gtacl passes the complete MQTMC2 structure\ntext (which is 560 bytes) to the application being triggered, whereas if\nthe \"-c\" option is used, limitations in TACL will cause the triggered \napplication to receive 520 bytes only.\nApplications intended to be triggered using -p option must handle the \ncomplete 560 character startup character string.\nThis can cause problems, particularly with COBOL applications;\nSince a COBOL GETSTARTUPTEXT call can process only 529 characters,\ntriggering a COBOL application with the -p option (560 character startup\nstring) can result in a memory overwrite and application abend.\nIn this case, the -c option should be used instead of the -p option.\"\n\n20. Maximum numnber of LQMA processes\n\nThe maximum number of LQMA processes per queue manager is 1417. Attempts to\nconfigure a MaxUnthreadedAgents value of 1418 or greater in the qmproc.ini file\nwill result in FDCs when the queue manager attempts to start the 1418th LQMA.\n\n21. Limitation on ProcessNameRoot values in qmproc.ini file\n\nThe ProcessNameRoot value used in the qmproc.ini file for the MCA, LQMA and \nRepositoryManager stanzas must be unique across all queue managers in all\ninstallations on the system. If the values are not unique, two queue \nmanagers attempting to create a new process name at the same time may attempt\nto use the same sequence of names, resulting in heavy load on the OSS\nnameserver and/or FDCs with probes EC062000 from eclStartMCA or EC065000 from\neclStartLQMA. This may result in the queue manager becoming unresponsive.\n\n22. BIND/REPLACE Warning 9\n\nThe use of BIND/REPLACE when re-binding non-native (TNS) applications with \nthe latest WMQ TNS Library is supported, however, when using this command, \nyou may encounter many Bind 'warning 9' messages. These warnings are safe to\nignore, as the changes made in the MQMTNS library are completely contained\nwithin that library and there is no external affect on an application that\nwould link with that library. Please refer to document \nID mmr_ns-4.0.6050052.2565545 in KBNS which has been updated by HP to include\nthis information. \n\n23. PING CHANNEL uses the =TCPIP^PROCESS^NAME DEFINE as opposed to the \nvalue set in the qmproc.ini file.\n\nIf the TCPIP^PROCESS^NAME DEFINE is invalid, attempts to issue a \nPING CHANNEL request will fail with the following message -\n\":AMQ9212: A TCP/IP socket could not be allocated.\"\n\n24. Using multiple cluster receiver channels for a queue manager can cause the \nmaster and slave repository managers to get out of sync in some configurations, \nthis results in FFSTs from rrmHPNSSGetMetaPacket with Comment1 field \n\"Meta data mis-match Expected: metalen=xx\".\nThe root cause of this problem has not been identified definitively, but it is\nrecommended that cluster configurations do not use multiple cluster receiver \nchannels for the same cluster on a given queue manager.\n\n25. Format 2 Queue and Queue overflow files are not supported\n\nIf an attempt is made to use altmqfls to change extent size or max extents of \na Queue or Queue overflow file such that the new file size would require a\nformat 2 file, the attempt will fail and an FDC file containing the following\n\nProbe Id :- XC066050 \nComponent :- xgcDupPartFile \n... \nMajor Errorcode :- xecF_E_UNEXPECTED_RC \nMinor Errorcode :- krcE_UNEXPECTED_ERROR \nProbe Description :- AMQ6118: An internal WMQ error has occurred \n(20800893) \n...\nArith1 :- 545261715 20800893 \n\n26. RUNMQSC DISPLAY QSTATUS(*) TYPE(HANDLE) ALL can return only 500 handles\n\nThe current implementation of DISPLAY QSTATUS can handle only 500 queue\nhandles. In prior releases, executing the command in a scenario where there\nwere more than 500 handles resulted in an error return and large numbers of \nFFSTs (see internal defect 2230 earlier in this readme). These errors are the\nresult of a design limitation with the DISPLAY QSTATUS implementation. \nThe processing of the command has been modified to handle the scenario cleanly\nand return only the first 500 handles retrieved, as supported by the design.\n\nKnown problems and workarounds\n------------------------------\n1. FDCs from Component xcsDisplayMessage reporting xecF_E_UNEXPECTED_SYSTEM_RC\n\nOn RVUs H06.06 and later:\n\nThese FDCs occur frequently on queue manager shutdown, and at times during\nqueue manager start, from processes that write to the queue manager log\nfiles at these times, typically the cluster repository cache manager\n(amqrrmfa) and the EC (MQECSVR). No functional problem is caused by these\nFDCs, except that the queue manager log file misses some log messages\nduring queue manager shutdown. The FDCs report an unexpected return code\nfrom the HP lseek() function. An example of an FDC demonstrating this\nproblem follows:\n\nProbe Id :- XC022011\nComponent :- xcsDisplayMessage\nProgram Name :- $DATA06.RP1PBIN.MQECSVR\nMajor Errorcode :- xecF_E_UNEXPECTED_SYSTEM_RC\n\nMQM Function Stack\nnspPrimary\neclShutdownOK\nxcsDisplayMessageForSubpool\nxcsDisplayMessage\nxcsFFST\n\n6fffe660 000011FA ....\n6fffe670 2F686F6D 652F726F 622F4D51 /home/test/MQ\n6fffe680 352E332F 5250312F 50726F64 2F776D71 5.3/RP1/Prod/wmq\n6fffe690 2F766172 2F6D716D 2F716D67 72732F51 /var/mqm/qmgrs/Q\n6fffe6a0 4D312F65 72726F72 732F414D 51455252 M1/errors/AMQERR\n6fffe6b0 30312E4C 4F47 01.LOG\n\nThis problem is fixed by the following HP SPRs\n\nT8620ACL (OSSFS) for G06 HP OS\nT8620ACM (OSSFS) for H06 HP OS\n\n2. APAR IC54594 - EC abends with non-MQM user running application from non-MQM\ndirectory.\n\nStatically-bound TNS applications that are not relinked after installing \nFixpack 5.3.1.4 have additional considerations. For these applications, \nqmproc.ini Application Rules 2 and 4 will not work if the application \nis located in a non-MQM directory.\n\n3. The Guardian control commands for the Publish / Subscribe broker\n(strmqbrk, endmqbrk, dspmqbrk ... etc) will not work correctly unless they\nare run in the same CPU as the broker is running in, or was last running in.\n\nPlease use the equivalent OSS commands instead of the Guardian versions, or\nensure that the Guardian Publish / Subscribe broker commands run in the same\nCPU as the broker was or is running in.\n\n4. Queue managers occasionally do not delete Temporary Dynamic Queues the \nwhen the last application closes them. The cause of this is unknown at present.\nThe problem is rare and unlikely to cause significant impact on queue \nmanager operation unless the queues are present in very large numbers.\nQueues orphaned in this way cannot be used by applications, and are removed\nunconditionally as a part of the normal garbage collection activity during \na queue manager restart.\n\nDOCUMENTATION UPDATES\n=====================\n\nPlease note that several supplements to the documentation have been provided\nwith fixpacks since V5.3 was originally released. These supplements have\nbeen released in Adobe Acrobat format and can found in the\nopt/mqm/READMES/en_US directory of any installation as well as the original\nsoftware distribution tree (placed files). The following supplements have\nbeen released to date (the name of the file describes the content):\n\nExits.pdf\nJava.pdf\nPubsub.pdf\nSNAChannels.pdf\nSSLUpdate.pdf\nUpgmqmreadme.pdf\nSdcp.pdf\n\nAlso please note that the current published versions of the cross-platform\n(\"family\") books contain references to the IBM MQSeries V5.1 for Compaq NSK\nproduct which is the previous major version of WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop\nServer. Consequently, these references may not be accurate with respect to\nthe functional support provided by V5.3.1.\n\nWebsphere MQ Programmable Command Formats and Administration Interface\n(SC34-6060-03)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChapter 3 - PCF Commands and Responses in Groups\n\nPage 19: Add \"Refresh Queue manager\" as a supported command\n\nChapter 4 - Definitions of Programmable Command Formats\n\nPage 173: Add the following new command:\n\nRefresh Qmgr\n\nThe Refresh Qmgr (MQCMD_REFRESH_Q_MGR) command refreshes the\nExecution Controller (EC) process management rules.\n\nThis PCF is supported only on WebSphere MQ V5.3 HP NonStop Server.\n\nRequired parameters:\nNone\n\nOptional parameters:\nNone\n\nError codes\n\nThis command might return the following in the response format\nheader, in addition to the values shown on page 18.\n\nReason (MQLONG)\n\nThe value can be:\nMQRCCF_PARM_COUNT_TOO_BIG\n\nParameter count too big.\n\nWebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server Quick Beginnings (GC34-6626-00)\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChapter 1 - Planning to install WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server\n\nPage 1: the baseline release level for V5.3.1 on the HP Integrity NonStop\nServer is now H06.05.01\nPage 1: the typical approximate storage requirements are as follows:\n+ OSS files placed before installation:\nH-Series: 160Mb\n+ For each installation:\nH-Series: Guardian 220Mb, OSS 350Mb, Total 570Mb\n+ For each queue manager:\nH-Series: Guardian 9.5Mb, OSS 0.2Mb, Total 10Mb\nPages 2 & 3: please review the section \"Hardware and Software\nRequirements\" in these release notes for the details of all other updated\nrequirements\nChapter 3 - Installing WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server\n\nPage 12: Product Selection dialog. The names of the products have been\nupdated to \"WebSphere MQ V5.3.1\" and \"WebSphere MQ V5.3.1 Integrity\".\nPage 14: instmqm now includes the function of creating an automatic\nbackup archive of a successful installation, as follows:\nInstmqm has been enhanced to provide the ability to back-out an ungrade\ninstallation, and the ability to archive and restore installations\nindividually. Before instmqm starts to make changes to a system, it will\nautomatically create an archive of the current installation (OSS opt tree\nand Guardian installation subvolumes only) in the root directory\ncontaining the opt tree in OSS. If a failure occurs during installation,\nand instmqm has made changes, the user will be asked if they wish to\nrestore the installation to its original state using the archive created\nbefore changes were made. At the end of a successful installation,\ninstmqm will now automatically create a backup archive of the new\ninstallation.\n\nInstmqm also supports two new command line options to support creating\nand using backup archives independently from an installation:\n\n-b create a backup archive of the installation\n-x restore an installation from a backup archive\n\nThese options may not be combined with any other options. Both options\nrequire the user to respond to questions at the terminal.\n\nA backup archive file is an OSS pax file, created as follows:\n\n+ the Guardian PAK utility is used to create a backup of the three\nGuardian subvolumes for the installation in a file named \"WMQSAVED\"\n+ the PAK backup file is copied to the OSS opt directory of the\ninstallation that is being archived\n+ the entire OSS opt tree of the installation (which now includes\nWMQSAVED) is then archived by the OSS pax utility\n\nBackup archive files are always created in the directory that holds the\nOSS opt tree for the installation. Archive files created automatically\nby instmqm are named \"mqarchive-yymmdd-hhmmss\" where \"yymmdd\" and\n\"hhmmss\" are numeric strings of the date and time that the backup archive\nwas created - for example: \"mqarchive-061005-143606\".\n\nPage 15: instmqm has new command line options as described in these\nrelease notes for creating and restoring backup archives\nPage 17: the SnaProviderName and TcpProviderName fields of the\nQmgrDefaults stanza in the instmqm response file are used to populate\nthe proc.ini file to provide installation wide defaults for channels.\nPlease note that these fields do not get used for the default listener\nconfiguration either on the command line (runmqlsr) or in the queue\nmanager's Pathway environment. Users must manually configure the\ntransport names for all listeners.\nPage 28: in addition to the manual methods for cleaning up after a failed\ninstallation, instmqm will offer the option to restore the previous\ninstallation from a backup archive in the event of a failure while\nupgrading a V5.3 installation to V5.3.1 level. These release notes\ndescribe the additional function.\nIf an installation was initially created without SSL (selection of the\ninstallation type \"CORE\" for instmqm), the following procedure can be\nused to update the installation to include SSL components. In the\ninstructions below, <MQInstall> refers to the location of the\ninstallation that needs to be updated and <PlacedInstall> means the\nlocation of the complete set of placed files for the level of WMQ that\ncorresponds to the installation being updated. All queue managers\nmust be ended before attempting this procedure.\n1. mkdir <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/ssl\n2. chmod 775 <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/ssl\n3. cp <PlacedInstall>/opt/mqm/ssl/* <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/ssl\n4. chmod 775 <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/ssl/amq*\"...\n5. cp <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/ssl/openssl <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/bin\n6. chmod 664 <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/ssl/openssl\n7. chmod 774 <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/bin/openssl\n8. cp <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/ssl/amqjkdm0 <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/bin\n9. chmod 775 <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/bin/amqjkdm0\n10. mv <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/lib/amqcctca\n<MQInstall>/opt/mqm/lib/amqcctca_nossl\n11. mv <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/lib/amqcctca_r\n<MQInstall>/opt/mqm/lib/amqcctca_r_nossl\n12. cp <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/ssl/amqccssl <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/lib/amqcctca\n13. cp <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/ssl/amqccssl_r\n<MQInstall>/opt/mqm/lib/amqcctca_r\n14. chmod 775 <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/lib/amqcctca*\n15. The <MQInstall>/var/mqm/qmgrs/<qmgr name> directory should have an\n\nssl directory which is where you will store the certificate related\nfiles (cert.pem, trust.pem etc.)\n16. The <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/samp/ssl should exist already with the ssl\nsamples\n17. If the entropy daemon is not configured on the system this will need\nto be performed. Refer to the WMQ V53 HP NonStop System\nAdministration Chapter 11 page 165-167\n18. Install the certificates per the updated instructions, SSLupdate.pdf\nfound in <MQInstall>/opt/mqm/READMES/en_US\n\nChapter 5 - Creating a Version 5.3 queue manager from an existing Version 5.1\nqueue manager\n\nPages 37 & 38: this section is completely replaced by the documentation\nsupplement Upgmqmreadme.pdf supplied with this release.\nChapter 7 - Applying maintenance to WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server\n\nPages 44 & 45: the tool for applying maintenance is named \"svcmqm\" and\nnot \"installCSDxx\".\nPage 44: in step 3 of \"Transferring and preparing the PTF for\ninstallation\", the top level directory of the PTF is opt, and is not\nnamed differently for each PTF. Therefore it is important to manually\ncreate a directory specific to each PTF, download the PTF to that new\ndirectory and then expand the archive within the new directory.\nPage 44: in step 2 of \"Running the installation script for a PTF\", the\n\nsvcmqm tool has a different command line from that documented for\n\"installCSDxx\". svcmqm takes three parameters:\nsvcmqm -i installationtree -v vartree -s servicepackage\nwhere \"installationtree\" is the full path to the location of the opt/mqm\ndirectory of the installation to be updated\n\"vartree\" is the full path to the location of the var/mqm\ndirectory of the installation to be updated\n\"servicepackage\" is the full path to the location of the opt/mqm\ndirectory of the maintenance to be installed\nFor example:\nsvcmqm -i /home/me/wmq/opt/mqm -v /home/me/wmq/var/mqm\n-s /home/me/wmqfiles/opt/mqm\n\nwhich will update the installation in /home/me/wmq/opt/mqm and\n\n/home/me/wmq/var/mqm from the maintenance package in directory tree\n/home/me/wmqfiles/opt/mqm.\n\nIf either or both the \"-i installationtree\" and \"-v vartree\" parameters\nare omitted, svcmqm will use the current setting of the appropriate\nenvironment variable - either WMQNSKOPTPATH or WMQNSKVARPATH.\n\nWebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server System Administration Guide (SC34-6625-00)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChapter 2 - An introduction to WebSphere MQ administration\n\nPage 16: before running any control commands on OSS or NonStop OS it is\nnecessary to establish the environment variables for the session. When\nan installation is created a file called wmqprofile is also created in\nthe var/mqm directory that will establish the environment for an OSS\nshell. Likewise, a file is also created in the NonStop OS subvolume\ncontaining the WMQ NonStop OS samples called WMQCSTM that can be used\nto set up the appropriate environment variables for a NonStop OS TACL\nsession.\nTo establish the WMQ environment for an OSS shell session:\n\n. wmqprofile\n\nTo establish the WMQ environment for a NonStop OS TACL session:\n\nobey WMQCSTM\n\nThe same steps are required before running any applications in the\nOSS or NonStop OS environment.\n\nChapter 4 - Administering local WebSphere MQ objects\n\n\nPage 48: when creating a Process definition, the default value for\nthe APPLTYPE attribute is \"NSK\" (indicating a Guardian program)\nChapter 7 - WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server architecture\n\nPage 80: the MQSC command to reload the process management rules is\nREFRESH QMGR TYPE(NSPROC) and not RESET QMGR TYPE(NSPROC)\nChapter 8 - Managing scalability, performance, availability and data\nintegrity\n\nPage 104: the last paragraph of the OpenTMF section should be reworded\nas follows:\nNo special administrative actions are required for this use of TMF.\nWebSphere MQ uses and manages it automatically. You must ensure that\nthe RMOPENPERCPU and BRANCHESPERRM configuration parameters of TMF are\nset to appropriate values for your configuration. Please see Chapter 12\n\nTransactional Support - Configuring TMF for WebSphere MQ for\ninformation on how to calculate the correct values. The HP TMF Planning\nand Configuration Guide describes the subject of resource managers and\nheterogeneous transaction processing.\n\nChapter 9 - Configuring WebSphere MQ\n\nPage 119: the CPUS section should state that the default can be\noverridden using the crtmqm -nu parameter. See Chapter 18 - The control\ncommands for a description of how to use this parameter with crtmqm.\nPage 120: the section describing the ARGLIST attribute of a TCP/IP\nListener should also mention the use of the optional -u parameter to\nconfigure channels started by the listener as unthreaded processes.\nThe default is to run incoming channels as threads in an MCA process.\nPage 130: the MQSC command to reload the process management rules is\nREFRESH QMGR TYPE(NSPROC) and not RESET QMGR TYPE(NSPROC)\nPage 133: Figure 23 remove :\nOAM Manager stanza #\nOamManager:\nPage 136: the Exit properties section should state that the only\n\nsupported way of configuring and running a Cluster Workload (CLWL) Exit\nfor HP NonStop Server is in FAST mode. The CLWLMode setting in qm.ini\nis required to be set to FAST, which is the default for WebSphere MQ\non this platform.\nPage 139: the MQIBindType attribute of the Channels stanza is set by\ncrtmqm to FASTPATH. This should not be changed, except under the\ndirection of IBM Service.\nPage 140: the AdoptNewMCA=FASTPATH option is always required for\nthis platform in order for the adoption of MCAs to be effective. The\n\"Attention!\" box after the description of the FASTPATH option should\nbe ignored.\nPage 140: add the following description of the ClientIdle attribute:\nClientIdle=seconds\n\nClientIdle specifies the number of seconds of inactivity to permit\nbetween client application MQI calls before WebSphere MQ terminates\nthe client connection. The default is to not terminate client\nconnections however long they remain inactive. When a client connection\nis terminated because of idle activity, the client application receives\na connection broken result (2009) on its next MQI call.\n\nChapter 11 - Working with the WebSphere MQ Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) support\n\nA documentation supplement has been written to replace the sections on\nPage 170 (Preparing the queue manager's SSL files) to Page 176 (Building\nand verifying the sample configuration) because of changes to the files\nthat WebSphere MQ uses to hold certificates. The documentation supplement\nis called SSLupdate.pdf, and can be found in the opt/mqm/READMES/en_US\ndirectory of an installation.\n\nChapter 12 - Transactional Support\n\nPage 185: The descriptions of the TMF attribute RMOPENPERCPU in the\n\nResource manager configuration section is modified as follows:\nRMOPENPERCPU\n\nEach WebSphere MQ thread or process that handles transactions has\nan open of a Volatile Resource Manager in the CPU it runs in. In\naddition, each application thread or process using the MQI also has\nan open. The minimum requirement for this configuration parameter\n\nis therefore the sum of:\n+ all Queue Server processes in that CPU\n+ all LQMA and MCA threads running in that CPU\n+ all MQI application threads running in that CPU\n+ 10 (to account for miscellaneous queue manager processes that\ncould be running in that CPU)\nYou should calculate the peak values of these numbers across all CPUs\nand add a safety margin to arrive at the correct value for your system.\nThe HP default value of 128 for this parameter is often suitable for\nsmall configurations, but unsuitable for medium or large ones.\n\n\nPage 186: add the following paragraph to the Troubleshooting section\nfor Configuring TMF:\nIf the RMOPENPERCPU value is not configured to allow sufficient opens\nof resource managers in a CPU, WebSphere MQ connections will fail with\nan unexpected return code, and FDCs will be generated reporting an\nerror with the TMF_VOL_RM_OPEN_. The workaround is to distribute\napplications and queue manager processes in the CPU that exceeds\nthe limit to other CPUs. The correct remedy is to schedule an outage\nand modify the TMF configuration.\n\nPage 186: add the following paragraph to the Troubleshooting section\nfor configuring TMF:\nIf TMF is stopped, or new transactions are disabled, and WMQ requires\nan internal \"unit of work\" (TMF transaction) to perform an update to\na protected resource requested by an MQI call, that call will fail\nand the reason code returned will be MQRC_UOW_NOT_AVAILABLE (2255).\n\nNote that in some cases, updates to protected resources may be\nrequired by MQI operations do not directly perform messaging\noperations - for example, MQOPEN of a model queue that creates a\npermanent dynamic queue. If MQI calls return MQRC_UOW_NOT_AVAILABLE,\ncheck the status of the TMF subsystem to determine the likely cause.\n\nChapter 14 - Process Management\n\nPage 197: the MQSC command to reload the process management rules is\nREFRESH QMGR TYPE(NSPROC) and not RESET QMGR TYPE(NSPROC)\n\nPage 200 and 204: the default value for the maximum number of unthreaded\nagents is now 200. The default value for the maximum number of threaded\nagents is now 20. the default value for the maximum use count for\nthreaded agents is now 100.\n\nPage 203: add a new paragraph titled \"Pathway\":\nPathway\nThis stanza contains 3 attributes:-\n- ProcessName\n- DynamicProcessName\n- Hometerm\nProcessName is the name of the Queue Managers pathmon process.\nIf the -np option was specified at queue Manager creation, \nthe value of ProcessName will be set to the value of that option \nwhen the qmproc.ini file is created\nIf DynamicProcessName is set to Yes, the system will generate a name\nfor the pathmon process at the time the Queue Manager starts.\nIf the value is set to no, the value of the ProcessName attribute\nwill determine the pathmon process name for the queue manager \nHometerm specifies the value of the hometerm attribute for the Queue \nManager pathmon process \nIf the -nh opton was specified at queue manager creation, the \nvalue of Hometerm will be set to the value of that option, \notherwise the default of $ZHOME will be used.\n\nPage 204: the \"valid attribute values\" for the attribute \"ExecutableName\"\nshould be stated as \"File name part only of the program to run for the\nLQMA or MCA process\".\n\nPages 203 - 205, Table 20: Process Management: Keyword definition Summary\nThere are a number of errors in the Process Management Keyword\ndefinition table:\n\n1.

Please use care when using altmqfls to set the queue options\n\n(--qsoptions parameter) and refer to the reference section for the\ncontrol commands for a complete description of using this option.\nPage 217: the bullet point that describes the configuration of AutoSYNC\nfilesets is incorrect when it states that NO ALLSYMLINKS should be\nspecified. Replace sub-bullet item number 2 with the following text:\n2. The entire queue manager OSS directory structure\nvar_installation_path/var/mqm/qmgrs/qmname.\n\nYou must specify the absolute path name of the queue manager's\ndirectory. Specify the ALLSYMLINKS option for this fileset to\nensure that AutoSYNC correctly synchronizes the symbolic link\n(G directory) in the queue manager's directory to the NonStop OS queue\nmanager's subvolume on the backup system.\n\nChapter 16 - Troubleshooting\n\nPage 230: after the section \"Is your application or system running\nslowly?\", insert the following new section:\nAre your applications or WebSphere MQ processes unable to connect?\n\nIf connection failures are occurring:\n\nis the User ID under which the application runs authorized to\nuse this queue manager?\nare SAFEGUARD permissions preventing read access to the WebSphere\nMQ installation files by the User ID running the application?\nare the environment variables established for the application\nprocess, so that the correct installation of WebSphere MQ is being\nused?\nif necessary, has the application been relinked or rebound with\nany static MQI libraries that it uses?\nis a resource problem preventing the queue manager from allowing\nthe connection? Review the troubleshooting section under TMF\nConfiguration on Page 185 and 186 for information about the\nRMOPENSPERCPU TMF attribute.\n\nChapter 18 - The control commands\n\nPage 93: The example of the --resetmeasure option is missing a mandatory\nparameter having the value \"YES\" or \"NO\". The paragraph on page 93 describing\nthe --resetmeasure option should be replaced with the following\n\n\"The queue server can maintain the Measure counter only if it is included \nin an active measurement. If it is not included in an active measurement, \nand messages are put in the queue and removed from the queue, the value \nof the counter will no longer represent the current depth of the queue. \nIf the counter is subsequently included in an active measurement, you can \ncause the queue server to reset the Measure counter to the current depth \nof the queue by using the --resetmeasure parameter on the altmqfls command, \nas follows: altmqfls --qmgr QMGR --type QLOCAL --resetmeasure TEST.QUEUE YES\"\n\nPage 244: The mandatory YES|NO parameter is missing from the syntax diagram\n\nPage 247: The mandatory YES|NO parameter is missing from the description\nof the option\n\nPage 243: the control commands for the Publish / Subscribe broker are\nnot referenced here.

This can be used to restrict access to the queue\nmanager's Pathway environment. The current Pathway attributes can be\ndisplayed in PATHCOM using the INFO PATHWAY command.\nPage 255: the -nu parameter for setting the default CPUS attribute\nin Pathway serverclasses does not accept all the values that Pathway\nallows for this attribute. The only accepted values (and the result in\nPathway configuration) are of the form:\n-nu value Pathway CPUS attribute\n-------- ---------------------\n-nu a CPUS (a:0)\n-nu a:b CPUS (a:b)\n\nMore complex Pathway serverclass CPUS attributes settings must be\nconfigured after the queue manager has been created, using the HP\nPATHCOM utility.\n\nChapter 23 - API exits\n\nPages 373-375: please review the updates to this section in the\ndocumentation supplement for API exits for HP NonStop Server called\nExits.pdf. This supplement has been extensively revised for V5.3.1.1\nto clarify the requirements and process for creating and integrating\nexits with WebSphere MQ.\n\nAppendix B - Directory structure\n\nPages 430 and 431: there is a new G symbolic link to the Guardian\nsubvolume containing the product executables in\n.../var/mqm/qmgrs/@SYSTEM\nPage 431: the content of the ssl directory is revised with V5.3.1.1\nas follows:\nThis directory contains up to four files used by the SSL support:\n\nThe queue manager certificate and private key store (cert.pem)\nThe trusted certificates store (trust.pem)\nThe pass phrase stash file for the queue managers certificate\nand private key store (Stash.sth)\nThe certificate revocation list file (optional - crl.pem)\n\nAppendix F - Environment variables\n\nPage 446: there are several environment variables that are used by the\nGuardian sample build scripts to locate the header files and the\nlibraries. Suitable settings for these are established in the\nWMQCSTM file (in the Guardian samples subvolume). The environment\nvariables, and their meanings, are:\nMQNSKOPTPATH^INC^G include file/header subvolume\nMQNSKOPTPATH^BIN^G binaries subvolume\nMQNSKOPTPATH^LIB^G binaries subvolume\nMQNSKOPTPATH^SAMP^G samples subvolume\n\nIn addition, an HP environment variable is also required (and set in\nWMQCSTM) that locates the OSS DLLs for dynamic loading from Guardian.\nThe environment variable is ^RLD^FIRST^LIB^PATH.\n\nPage 468: add after the \"Queue Server Tuning parameters\" section\n\nQueue Manager Server tuning parameters\n\nMQQMSHKEEP If this ENV is set for the MQS-QMGRSVR00 serverclass, its value\nspecifies a numeric value in seconds to override the default housekeeping\ninterval of the queue manager server. The default interval is 60 seconds.\nThe housekeeping interval controls how frequently the queue manager\nserver generates expiration reports. The permitted range of values is 1-300.\nValues outside this range will be ignored and the default value will be used.\n\nMQQMSMAXMSGSEXPIRE If this ENV is set for the MQS-QMGRSVR00 serverclass,\nits value specifies a numeric value to override the default maximum number\nof expiration report messages that are generated during housekeeping\noperations by a queue manager server. The default maximum number of expiration\nmessages generated is 100. The permitted range of values is 1-99999. Values\noutside this range will be ignored and the default value will be used.\n\n\nAppendix H - Building and running applications\n\nBuilding C++ applications,\n\nTable 47 - there is no multi-threaded library support in\nGuardian so there should not be an entry for a\nmulti-threaded guardian library\n\nTable 48 - the name of this table should be \"Native non-PIC\"\n\nReferences to G/lib symbolic links have changed with WMQ 5.3.1 to lib/G\n\nNote that the MQNSKVARPATH and MQNSKOPTPATH environment variables must\nbe established in the environment, before an application starts up.\nThey cannot be programmatically set once a program is running by using\nputenv().\n\nPage 461: Building COBOL applications\n\nAdd the following text:\n\n\"In both the OSS and Guardian environment, the CONSULT compiler\ndirective referencing the MQMCB import library must now be used along\nwith correct linker options. Refer to the BCOBSAMP TACL script described\nin Appendix I for more information.\"\n\nAppendix I - WebSphere MQ for NonStop Server Sample Programs\n\nPages 465-466: The section \"TACL Macro file for building C Sample Programs\"\nis replaced by the following:\n\nBCSAMP - Build a C-Language Sample.\n\nThis TACL script will compile and link a C-language sample into an\nexecutable program. The script expects that the WMQ environment has\nbeen established using WMQCSTM.\n\nBCSAMP usage:\n\nBCSAMP <type> <source>\n\n<type> The type of executable program that should be built.\n\nValid values are:\n\npic A native PIC program\ntns A non-native TNS program\n\n<source> The filename of the source module to be compiled and linked\n\nThe <source> filename should end with a 'C'. The final program name is\nthe same as the source filename with the trailing 'C' removed.\n\nPage 467: The section \"TACL Macro files for building COBOL Sample\nPrograms\" is replaced by the following:\n\nBCOBSAMP - Build a COBOL Sample.\n\nThis TACL script will compile and link a COBOL sample into an executable\nprogram. The script expects that the WMQ environment has been established\nusing WMQCSTM.\n\nBCOBSAMP usage:\n\nBCOBSAMP <type> <source>\n\n<type> The type of executable program that should be built.\n\nValid values are:\n\npic A native PIC program\ntns A non-native TNS program\n\n<source> The filename of the source module to be compiled and linked\n\nThe <source> filename should end with an 'L'. The final program name is\nthe same as the <source> filename with the trailing 'L' removed.\n\nPage 469: The section \"TACL Macro files for building TAL sample programs\"\nis replaced by the following:\n\nBTALSAMP - Build a TAL Sample.\n\nThis TACL script will compile and link a TAL sample into an executable\nprogram. The script expects that the WMQ environment has been established\n\nusing WMQCSTM.\n\nBTALSAMP usage:\n\nBTALSAMP <source>\n\n<source> The filename of the source module to be compiled and linked\n\nThe final program name is the same as the <source> filename with the\ntrailing character removed.\n\nAppendix J - User exits\n\nrefer to the documentation supplement Exits.pdf for updated information\nabout configuring and building user exits. This supplement has been\nextensively revised for V5.3.1.1 to clarify the requirements and process\nfor creating and integrating exits with WebSphere MQ.\nThe description of compile options for PIC unthreaded, threaded and\nGuardian dlls in this document is incorrect. The option specified as\n\"-export all\" should be \"-export_all\".\n\nAppendix K - Setting up communications\n\nPage 482: The TCP/IP keep alive function\n\nBy default, the TCP/IP keep alive function is not enabled. To enable\nthis feature, set the KeepAlive=Yes attribute in the TCP Stanza in the\nqm.ini file for the queue manager.\nIf this attribute it set to \"yes\" the TCP/IP subsystem checks periodically\nwhether the remote end of a TCP/IP connection is still available. If it is\nnot available, the channel using the connection ends.\nIf TCP stanza KeepAlive attribute is not present or is set to \"No\", the\nTCP/IP subsystem will not check for disconnection of the remote end.\n\nChapter 9 \"Configuring WebSphere MQ\" page 140 describes the TCP stanza\nattributes.\n\nAPAR IC58859: wmqtrig script\nThe wmqtrig script processing the -c option, for triggering a TACL macro/script\nfile, will not normally propagate the TMC data to the macro/script file.\nSome applications may need the TMC for processing. A switch used in conjunction\nwith the -c option, -5.1, has been added which will pass the TMC data to a TACL\nmacro/script file with the wmqtrig script. Define the APPLICID attribute with\nthe -5.1 switch, for example:\nAPPLICID(/wmq/opt/mqm/bin/wmqtrig -5.1 -c \\$data06.test.trigmac)\n\nSSLupdate.pdf page 7\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe SSLupdate.pdf document was first released with Fixpack 5.3.1.1\n\nThe SSL test scripts expect that a default TCP/IP process ($ZTC0) is\nconfigured on the system to be used during the test. The configuration\nwill need modification if a non-default TCP/IP process does not exist\non the system or another TCP/IP process is used to communicate with the\npartner system. The ALICE.sh and/or BOB.sh scripts that setup of the\nlistener (runmqlsr) will need modification to add the -g option to use a\nnon-default TCP/IP process.\n\nCONTACTING IBM SOFTWARE SUPPORT\n===============================\n\nIBM Software Support provides assistance with product defects. You might\nbe able to solve you own problem without having to contact IBM Software\nSupport.

From other\ncountries, go to the \"Contacts\" page of the IBM Software Support\nHandbook at www.ibm.com/support/handbook [www.ibm.com/support/handbook], click 'contacts' and then \nclick the name of your geographic region. for phone numbers of people\nwho provide support for your location.\n\nTo contact IBM Software support, follow these steps:\n\n1. \"Determine the business impact of your problem\"\n2. \"Describe your problem and gather background information\"\n3. \"Submit your problem\"\n\nDetermine the business impact of your problem\n\n\nWhen you report a problem to IBM, you are asked to supply a severity\nlevel. Therefore, you need to understand and assess the business impact\nof the problem that you are reporting. Use the following criteria:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nSeverity 1 The problem has a critical\nbusiness impact: You are unable\nto use the program, resulting in\na critical impact on operations.\nThis condition requires an\nimmediate solution.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nSeverity 2 This problem has a significant\nbusiness impact: The program is\nusable, but it is severely\nlimited.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nSeverity 3 The problem has some business\nimpact: The program is usable,\nbut less significant features\n(not critical to operations) are\nunavailable.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nSeverity 4 The problem has minimal business\nimpact: The problem causes\nlittle impact on operations, or\na reasonable circumvention to\nthe problem was implemented.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nDescribe your problem and gather background information\n\nWhen describing a problem to IBM, be as specific as possible. Include\nall relevant background information so that IBM Software Support\nspecialists can help you solve the problem efficiently. See the\nMustGather Web page\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21229861 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21229861] for\ndetails of the documentation required. To save time, know the answers to\nthese questions:\n\nWhat software versions were you running when the problem occurred?\nDo you have logs, traces, and messages that are related to the problem\nsymptoms? IBM Software Support is likely to ask for this information.\nCan you re-create the problem? If so, what steps do you perform to\nre-create the problem? Did you make any changes to the system? For example,\ndid you make changes to the hardware, operating system, networking software,\nor other system components? Are you currently using a workaround for the\nproblem? If so, please be prepared to describe the workaround when you\nreport the problem.\n\nSubmit your problem\n\nYou can submit your problem to IBM Software Support in one of two ways:\n\nOnline: Go to the Submit and track problems tab on the IBM Software Support\nsite at http://www.ibm.com/software/support/probsub.html [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/probsub.html]. Type your\ninformation into the appropriate problem submission tool.\nBy phone: For the phone number to call in your country, go to the \"Contacts\"\npage of the IBM Software Support Handbook at\nwww.ibm.com/support/handbook [www.ibm.com/support/handbook], click 'contacts' and then click the name \nof your geographic region.\n\nIf the problem you submit is for a software defect or for missing or\ninaccurate documentation, IBM Software Support creates an Authorized\nProgram Analysis Report (APAR). The APAR describes the problem in\ndetail. Whenever possible, IBM Software Support provides a workaround\nthat you can implement until the APAR is resolved and a fix is\ndelivered. IBM publishes resolved APARs on the Software Support Web site\ndaily, so that other users who experience the same problem can benefit\nfrom the same resolution.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n++ ++\n++ COPYRIGHT, NOTICES AND TRADEMARKS ++\n++ ++\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n* IBM WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server, Version 5.3.1.12\n* Statement: Licensed Materials - Property of IBM\n* (c) Copyright IBM Corp. 1999, 2016\n* All rights reserved.\n* U.S. Government Users Restricted Rights - use,\n* duplication or disclosure restricted by GSA\n* ADP Schedule Contract with IBM Corp.\n* Status: Version 5.3.1.12\n* Created: May 20, 2016\n\nNOTICES AND TRADEMARKS\n======================\n\nIBM may not offer the products, services, or features discussed in this\ndocument in all countries.

Although these connections will eventually be discarded through the normal processing of the connection requests, it may be desirable to purge them all at once and allow the pool to refill with new, valid connections.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nWebSphere Application Server has an operation on the data source MBean that can be used to purge the connection pool. WebSphere Application Server MBean may be called via the wsadmin console, see the IBM Information Center topic \"Scripting the application serving environment (wsadmin)\" for more details. The operation name is: purgePoolContents. \n\nThe purgePoolContents operation has two options: \n\n 1. Normal:  * This is the default option. \n     * Existing in-flight transactions will be allowed to continue work. \n     * Shared connection requests will be honored. \n     * Free connections are cleaned up and destroyed. \n     * In use connections (for example: connections in transactions) are cleaned up and destroyed when returned to the connection pool. \n     * A close() call issued on any connection obtained prior to the purgePoolContents will be done synchronously (for example: wait for the jdbc driver to return before proceeding). \n     * Requests for new connections (not handles to existing old connections) will be honored.\n       \n       \n    \n    \n 2. Immediate:  * No new transactions will be allowed to start on any connections obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call. Instead, a StaleConnectionException is thrown. \n     * No new handles will be handed out on any connections obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call. Instead, a StaleConnectionException is thrown. \n     * Existing in-flight transactions will be allowed to continue work. Any new activities on a purged Connection will cause a StaleConnectionException or an XAER_FAIL exception (in the case of XA) \n     * A close() call issued on any connection obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call will be done asynchronously (for example: no waiting for the jdbc driver to return) This is useful if the driver returns. \n     * Due to the fact that close() does not wait, the number of connections will be decremented immediately in WebSphere Application Server. This might cause the total number of connections in WebSphere Application Server to be temporarily out of sync with the database total number of connections. \n     * Requests for new connections (for example: not handles to existing old connections) will be honored.\n    \n    \n\n\nExamples of operations that can be executed on the data source MBean using the wasdmin console:  1. List all data sources:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl queryNames *:type=DataSource,*\n    \n    Using Jython:\n    AdminControl.queryNames(\"*:type=DataSource,*\")\n    \n    \n 2. Initialize a variable to specify a data source (this example uses Default Datasource, but any data source name listed in the output of above command can be used):\n    Using Jacl:\n    set name \"Default Datasource\"\n    set ds [$AdminControl queryNames *:type=DataSource,name=$name,*] \n    \n    Using Jython:\n    name = \"Default Datasource\"\n    ds = AdminControl.queryNames(\"*:type=DataSource,name=\"+name+\",*\") \n    \n    \n 3. View the pool contents by invoking the showPoolContents operation of the data source MBean:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl invoke $ds showPoolContents\n    \n    Using Jython:\n    print AdminControl.invoke(ds, \"showPoolContents\")\n    \n    \n 4. View contents of all pools by invoking the showAllPoolContents operation of the data source MBean:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl invoke $ds showAllPoolContents\n    \n    \n    Using Jython:\n    print AdminControl.invoke(ds, \"showAllPoolContents\")\n    \n    \n 5. Immediately purge the pool by invoking the purgePoolContents operation of the data source MBean with the immediate option:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl invoke $ds purgePoolContents immediate\n    \n    \n    Using Jython:\n    AdminControl.invoke(ds, \"purgePoolContents\", \"immediate\")\n    \n    \n\nIf the purge operation is successful, no response will be observed. If the purge operation is not successful, the response will indicate a possible reason for failure. One common reason for failure is attempting to purge the contents of a connection pool which is not yet available (the connection pool is not created until a naming look-up of the associated datasource or connection factory occurs), resulting in an illegal state exception.  \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers Runtimes for Java Technology Java SDK Application Servers WebSphere Application Server for z/OS Java SDK z/OS 8.0, 7.0, 6.1", "document_id": "swg21220832", "all_doc_ids": ["swg21220832", "swg21578610", "swg1PK03834", "swg21506040", "swg1IV78137", "swg21980690", "swg21530973", "swg21487975", "swg1IV39940", "swg21476834", "swg1PK87867", "swg1PK55594", "swg21644184", "swg1PK79418", "swg21298347", "swg1PM74725", "swg27014111", "swg21684241", "swg1PI28764", "swg1PK06029", "swg21471779", "swg27009286", "swg27036798", "swg27009287", "swg27009288", "swg21686351", "swg27018542", "swg21478493", "swg1PK67027", "swg1PJ34853", "swg27021515", "swg27024367", "swg21469372", "swg21574202", "swg21324890", "swg27024037", "swg21883033", "swg21700079", "swg1PK69322", "swg1PM66476", "swg21455298", "swg21599191", "swg21278898", "swg21484808", "swg21275837", "swg21487838", "swg21523049", "swg21486113", "swg21398760", "swg1JR28566"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "There is much published documentation about stale connections to databases on the web, and yet stale connections continue to be a very common problem, at least with BPM databases.

This can occur when the application is unable to complete or rollback the transaction, for example if the application server crashes or does not shutdown properly. \n\nSYMPTOM\nThe symptom will vary depending on what items are locked by the orphaned transaction. Some of reported symptoms include: \n\n * Hung thread messages in WebSphere's SystemOut log indicating a socket read operation to SQL JDBC driver while other threads are concurrently waiting on Process Engine's getConfigInfo method. For example:  * Thread \"WebContainer : x\" (00000###) has been active for 600000 milliseconds and may be hung. There is/are x thread(s) in total in the server that may be hung.\n      at java.net.SocketInputStream.socketRead0(Native Method)\n      at java.net.SocketInputStream.read(SocketInputStream.java:140)\n      at com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.TDSChannel.read(IOBuffer.java:1782)\n      ... \n    * Thread \"WebContainer : y\" (00000###) has been active for 600000 milliseconds and may be hung. There is/are x thread(s) in total in the server that may be hung.\n      at filenet.pe.ejb.client.PEEJBSession.getConfigInfo(PEEJBSession.java:1430)\n      at filenet.vw.api.VWSession.updateConfig(VWSession.java:6138)\n      ...\n   \n   \n * Process Engine logs (pesvr_system.log) or client application's SystemOut.log may have repeated messages indicating \"Process Engine server is not yet initialized\" for an extended period of time.  * [FNRPE2131090482E]Server is being initialized. Retry the operation.\n      The Process Engine server is not yet initialized. The software automatically retries your operation but if the problem persists, try again.\n   \n   \n\nTerminology  * WebSphere Transaction Manager - The Transaction Manager code in WebSphere Application Server that manages the flow and recovery of the transaction initiated by the WebSphere applications. \n * XAResource - The connector used by WebSphere to communicate with the transaction based resource, in this case JDBC. \n * Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) - The service responsible for coordinating distributed transactions for Microsoft SQL Server. \n * READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT - Enabling this setting will isolate the transaction and allow other database connections to access the existing data values while the transaction is still in process. Microsoft SQL Server's default setting is to lock database records during update.\n\n\nCAUSE\nIf the application is interrupted while processing a transaction and unable to complete or rollback the transaction, it may result in an orphaned transaction in the Microsoft SQL database. With READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT disabled, which is the default behavior, the locks held by the transaction will be honored and may cause other SQL statements to wait. The default timeout is unlimited (0), so an orphaned transaction will wait indefinitely holding open any locks it owns.\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nIdentify any database connections blocked by orphaned connection. \n\nQuery the sys.dm_exec_requests table for entries with blocking_session_id = -2. If there any entries matching the criteria, they are waiting on an orphaned transaction. (See \"Reference for sys.dm_exec_requests TransactSQL\")\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nTo cleanup the transaction, the first option is to shutdown the application server, Microsoft SQL Server, and Microsoft DTC service, then bring them back up in reverse order. \n\n\nAn alternative option is to identify and remove the orphaned transaction. To identify the orphaned transaction, query the sys.dm_tran_locks table for entries with a request_session_id = -2. Use the kill command to terminate the transaction based on the entry's req_transactionUoW value. (See \"Blog entry about Orphaned MSDTC transactions\", \"MSDN reference for sys.dm_tran_locks\", and \"MSDN reference for Kill command\")\n\nAdditional settings that can help \n\n * READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT - This setting is required for both Content Engine and Process Engine databases and will allow queries to continue because the orphaned transaction is isolated. (See \"InfoCenter: Reducing deadlock errors in Microsoft SQL Server\" and \"InfoCenter: Creating a Microsoft SQL Server database for an object store\"). \n * ENABLE_XARESOURCE_TIMEOUT - By default, the WebSphere transaction manager will send a timeout value of 0. Starting in WebSphere Application Server 8.5.5.1, 8.0.0.8, and 7.0.0.31, a new custom property called ENABLE_XARESOURCE_TIMEOUT can be set in the transaction service, allowing the transaction manager to send the remaining transaction timeout to the XAResource.

This change hides custom priority attributes from subclasses such as IlrBusinessRule and its subclasses when you migrate your model. In particular the default rule model extension in JRules V7 no longer contains a \"priority\" property extension in the .brmx file as it is already part of the model.\n\nThe README file that comes with JRules 7.1.1 installations contains a note about the steps involved for migrating the priority property, a similar text is presented below. The README is an HTML file that can be found at the root of the installation of the product.\n\nRule Team Server migration of priority property\n\nIf you defined a custom priority property in IlrBusinessRule or a subclass, using one of the default extensions for example, you must rename this extended attribute in your custom class before you run the migration tool. For example, if your default extension model includes:\n\n<add-property className=\"BusinessRule\"> \n<property extractable=\"true\" name=\"priority\" type=\"String\"> \n<annotation id=\"column-name\" value=\"priority_ext\"/> \n</property> \n</add-property>\n\nChange the model before migration to:\n\n<add-property className=\"BusinessRule\"> \n<property extractable=\"true\" name=\"myPriority\" type=\"String\"> \n<annotation id=\"column-name\" value=\"priority_ext\"/> \n</property> \n</add-property>\n\nIn JRules 6.x, upload the modified model using Upload Only in the Rule Team Server Installation Manager. In JRules V7, use the same model to create the new Rule Team Server schema. The custom priority property on your business rules is stored in a new myPriority custom property that can then be copied to the JRules V7 priority property, which is now part of the base rule model. \n\nAn example of such a query that can be run to transfer the priority values from myPriorityto priority is:\n\nFind all business rules \nDo \nset the priority of each business rule to the my priority of each business rule\n\n[note: myPriority is automatically verbalized as \"my priority\" in this example]\n\nProceed to run the query using with Run Queryand then apply the actions on the listed rules with the link \u2192Apply Actions.\n\nOnce the migration has been completed and the priority values have been transferred you can revert your rule model extension to contain no custom priority property, and in this case the declaration in the .brmxfile is reduced to the following (assuming you have no other custom properties added to the BusinessRule class):\n\n<add-property className=\"BusinessRule\"/> \n\nRule Studio migration of priority property\n\nIf you have not been specifying any specific rule model extension with JRules 6.x (that is if you have been using the default built-in rule extension model) then you do not need to make modifications either to the rule model extension used by JRules 7.x.\n\nIf you have developed a custom rule model extension with JRules 6.x then it is possible you derived it from the default extension model that contained an explicit declaration of a priority property extension of this form: \n\n<add-property className=\"BusinessRule\"> \n<property extractable=\"true\" name=\"priority\" type=\"String\"> \n<annotation id=\"column-name\" value=\"priority_ext\"/> \n</property> \n</add-property>\n\nAs explained in introduction, in JRules 7.x this property is part of the model and should not be declared as an extension anymore, so your custom rule extension model may need to be modified to remove this declaration, for example with the following (assuming no other property extension to the BusinessRule class):\n\n<add-property className=\"BusinessRule\"/> \n\n\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration IBM Operational Decision Manager Platform Independent 8.5, 8.0, 7.5 Enterprise", "document_id": "swg21448570", "all_doc_ids": ["swg21427447", "swg21677726", "swg27023725", "swg21497636", "swg21586966", "swg21589513", "swg21439999", "swg21421294", "swg21570526", "swg21426014", "swg21622452", "swg21679681", "swg21473114", "swg21599241", "swg27019171", "swg21645312", "swg21637142", "swg21663395", "swg21400812", "swg21397169", "swg21616403", "swg21590082", "swg21469115", "swg21427772", "swg21495825", "swg21461685", "swg21425487", "swg21640540", "swg21456181", "swg21414493", "swg21584855", "swg21590333", "swg21509580", "swg21439260", "swg21457713", "swg21496566", "swg21587817", "swg21592060", "swg21507683", "swg21587770", "swg21419945", "swg21668133", "swg21469143", "swg21420910", "swg21634188", "swg21584856", "swg21400648", "swg21400705", "swg21443038", "swg21448570"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "We are planning below migration.\n\n[Current]\nDB2 z/OS V9.1 + IBM Cobol\n[New]\nDB2 AESE V10.5 FP7 / AIX V7.1 + Micro Focus Cobol (MF Cobol)\n\nAny known limitation or things what we need to concern?\n", "id": "DEV_Q114", "answers": [{"answer_id": 9086154, "document_id": "swg21989702", "question_id": "DEV_Q114", "text": "DB2 LUW precompile, prep write different code to DB2 z/OS?", "answer_start": 36, "answer_end": 94, "answer_category": null}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n Why does DB2 LUW precompile, prep write different code to DB2 z/OS? \n\nCAUSE\nIt is an expected current DB2 LUW behavior.\n\nANSWER\nHere is an example. \n\n------------------------------ \n<Before PRECOMPILE> \n01 BLOB1 USAGE ID SQL TYPE IS BLOB(10485760). \n\n<PRECOMPILE on z/OS> \n01 BLOB1. \n02 BLOB1-LENGTH PIC S9(9) COMP. \n02 BLOB1-DATA. \n49 FILLER PIC(10485760). \n\n<PRECOMPILE on LUW> \n01 BLOB1. \n02 BLOB1-LENGTH PIC S9(9) COMP. \n02 BLOB1-DATA PIC(10485760). \n------------------------------ \n\nAs above, we see DB2 z/OS has below two lines:\n------------------------------ \n02 BLOB1-DATA. \n49 FILLER PIC(10485760). \n------------------------------ \nbut DB2 LUW writes only one line as below for above two lines part.\n------------------------------ \n02 BLOB1-DATA PIC(10485760). \n------------------------------ \n\nIt is an expected current DB2 LUW behavior and we don't have any hidden \noption to generate the cobol declarations similar to z/OS precompiler.\n\nNote:\nThis behavior might be changed without notice in the future.

To make the updates, download the Process Designer file again and run the installation. Only the fixes or changes are applied.\n\n\nAbout this task\nWhen you install the fix pack, refresh pack, or interim fix, the IBM Process Designer.zip file is updated also. You must download it and install the updated Process Designer to the directory where you already installed Process Designer.\n\n\nProcedure \n\n 1. Open the Process Center.\n    \n    \n 2. Click the IBM Process Designer Download option. \n    \n    \n 3. When you are prompted, save the IBM Process Designer.zip file to your file system. This file contains everything that you need to install and run IBM Process Designer. Depending on your network connection, the download might take several minutes to complete.\n    \n    \n 4. Extract the contents of the IBM Process Designer.zip file to a temporary directory on your file system.\n    \n    \n 5. Open a command window and change to the directory where you extracted the contents of the IBM Process Designer.zip file. \n    \n    \n    Important: If you are running Microsoft Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows Server 2008, right-click the command prompt and select Run as administrator.\n    \n    \n 6. Run one of the following commands to update the Process Designer. Use the same command that you used to install the Process Designer.  * Default location (C:\\IBM\\ProcessDesigner\\v8.5)  * installProcessDesigner_admin.bat \n        * installProcessDesigner_nonadmin.bat\n          \n          \n       \n       \n     * Different location  * installProcessDesigner_admin.bat install_location \n        * installProcessDesigner_nonadmin.bat install_location\n          \n          \n       \n       If the location has spaces in the directory name, put the whole location in quotation marks. The following examples show how to install to a different location.  * installProcessDesigner_admin.bat D:\\IBM\\PD \n        * installProcessDesigner_admin.bat \"D:\\Process Designer\\\"\n       \n       \n    \n    \n\n\nResults \nIBM Process Designer is updated. Only the fixes or changes are applied. Installation messages are recorded in the %TEMP%\\IBMProcessDesignerInstall.log file, where the %TEMP% variable is typically set to C:\\Documents and Settings\\current_user_name\\Local Settings\\Temp.\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\nRefresh pack install verification \n\nFor upgrades of installations with existing profiles, refer to the Identifying profile update errors [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27042066#identify] section under the Profile upgrade tab for details on verifying the refresh pack installation. \n\nNote: Installation Manager on the Microsoft Windows operating system does not recognize profile update errors. When you upgrade an installation on Windows, you must look at the Identifying profile update errors [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27042066#identify] section, even if Installation Manager ends with the following message: The packages are updated. \nBack to top\n\n\n\nRolling back V8.5 Refresh Pack 5 \n\nYou can roll back the refresh pack to a previous version by using one of the following options:\nGraphical user interface (GUI) of IBM Installation Manager to roll back an installation\nCommand line interface of IBM Installation Manager for a silent roll back of a refresh pack\n\nNote: The following procedure rolls back only the product binary. Any existing profiles that were upgraded during a refresh pack installation are not rolled back; you must restore the profiles from the backup you took before you upgraded the product. Any new profiles created after the upgrade cannot be reused; you must delete and recreate the profiles after you have completed the rollback process.\n\n\nGraphical user interface (GUI) of IBM Installation Manager to roll back an installation\n\n\n 1.  Close all programs that were installed using Installation Manager before rolling back.\n     \n     \n 2.  Start Installation Manager. See Installation directories for the product and profile [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFPJS_8.5.5/com.ibm.wbpm.imuc.doc/topics/rins_installation_paths.html] for more information on where Installation Manager is installed.\n     \n     \n 3.  From the Start page of the Installation Manager, click Roll back to start the Roll back packages wizard.\n     \n     \n 4.  On the Roll Back Packages page, from the Package Group Name list, select the package group that contains the packages that you want to roll back and click Next.\n     \n     \n 5.  Select the version of the package to which you want to roll back and click Next. \n     \n     \n 6.  Read the summary information and click Roll Back to roll back the package. \n     \n     \n     When the rollback process completes, a message that confirms the success of the process is displayed near the top of the page. \n     \n     \n 7.  Optional: Click View log file to open the log file for the current session in a new window. \n     \n     \n 8.  Click Finish to close the wizard. \n     \n     \n 9.  Close Installation Manager. \n     \n     \n 10.

PASE for i also provides industry-standard and defacto-standard shells and utilities that provide you with a powerful scripting environment.\n\nTo start the PASE for i interactive environment, execute the CL command CALL QP2TERM from a 5250 emulation session command line.\n\nThe PASE for i environment allows the user to control system-wide and user-specific variables set during the startup of the environment or shell. The system-wide variables are controlled through the /QOpenSys/etc/profile file, which is read first during startup. These variables will apply to all instances of the PASE for i environment. The user-specific variables are controlled though the $HOME/.profile file located in the user's home directory and let you customize your individual working environment on a user-by-user basis. For the IBM i OS, the user's home directory is defined within the *USRPRF profile object. The user's home directory can be found by executing the \"DSPUSRPRF <profile>\" CL command or the \"print $HOME\" command in the PASE for i environment.\n\nNote: The PASE environment uses the /QOpenSys/etc/profile file. The /etc/profile file is only used by the Qshell environment.\n\nThese files do not exist by default. When created, they must be created using with a Coded Character Set Identifier (CCSID) of 819 or 1252 in order to be read properly by the PASE for iproduct. Here is an example of how to create these two files:\n\n1. STRQSH\n2. touch -C 819 /QOpenSys/etc/profile\n3. touch -C 819 /home/<user>/.profile\n\nDuring the startup of the PASE shell, the files are read in the order specified below if they are present/exist. The .profile file contains your individual profile variables which will override the variables set in the /QOpenSys/etc/profile file. To clarify further, if the variable PATH exists in both the /QOpenSys/etc/profile and $HOME/.profile files, the PATH variable value from the $HOME/.profile file will be used.\n\no /QOpenSys/etc/profile\no $HOME/.profile\no The PASE shell is then created\n\nHere is an example of the contents of a typical /QOpenSys/etc/profile or $HOME/.profile file:\n\n#Set file creation mask\nunmask 022\n#Add my directories to the shell search sequence\nPATH=/usr/bin:/QOpenSys/usr/bin:/etc:/home/user:.\n#Set up the Java environment\nJAVA_HOME=/QOpenSys/QIBM/ProdData/JavaVM/jdk626/32bit\n#Make some environment variables global\nexport PATH JAVA_HOME\n\n \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Operating System IBM i 6.1 Operating System IBM i 7.1 \nHISTORICAL NUMBER\n 662669367", "document_id": "nas8N1010486", "all_doc_ids": ["swg1JR51714", "swg1JR54039", "swg1JR53173", "swg1JR54248", "swg1JR55335", "swg1JR55583", "swg1IY81145", "swg1JR52156", "swg1JR58310", "swg21377268", "swg21268446", "swg21458372", "swg1PK60043", "swg1JR59399", "swg1PI23509", "swg21500756", "swg1JR47785", "swg1JR57555", "swg21428496", "swg21625466", "swg21673879", "swg21585265", "nas8N1013980", "swg1JR52375", "swg21291889", "swg22002330", "swg21998754", "swg1PK11502", "swg1JR49707", "swg27019949", "nas8N1016098", "swg1HD71167", "swg1IO09314", "swg21507258", "swg22012426", "swg1PK60373", "swg21594974", "swg21683894", "nas8N1010486", "swg1PK69769", "nas8N1011912", "swg21318409", "swg21408906", "swg21294171", "swg1PM70554", "swg1JR53670", "swg1JR54309", "nas8N1011804", "nas8N1013049", "swg21267202"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Why is WebSphere MQ connection failing when enabling SSL with AMQ9640 SSLPEER peer name error?\nexample client side error:com.ibm.mq.jmqi.JmqiException: CC=2;RC=2399;\n \nAMQ9640: SSL invalid peer name, channel '?',\n \nattribute 'OID.0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.3 (x2)'.", "id": "DEV_Q126", "answers": [{"answer_id": 87615105, "document_id": "swg21370228", "question_id": "DEV_Q126", "text": "", "answer_start": -1, "answer_end": 0, "answer_category": null}], "is_impossible": true}], "context": " TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n When trying to access the WebSphere Commerce tools such as WebSphere Commerce Accelerator, the following message is displayed:\n\nYou are not authorized to view this page\nHTTP Error 403 - Forbidden\n\nIn the Web server's error log, you see a message similar to this: \n[Mon Feb 02 18:11:39 2009] [warn] SSL0235W: SSL Handshake Failed, Invalid peer.\n[Mon Feb 02 18:12:33 2009] [warn] SSL0265W: Client did not supply a certificate. \n\nSYMPTOM\nYou cannot access any page over https (SSL port 443), or even the WebServer demo page.\n\n\nCAUSE\nThis error is caused by incorrect WebServer settings for the SSLClientAuth attribute.

The intention is to have the latest clarifications and corrections contained in this technote.\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\n1. Using a Date/Time property as a filter condition is not generating the correct result set. \n\nThe documentation example from the documentation page shows that a Date value is to be added to the Filter payload:\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCTJ4_5.1.0/com.ibm.casemgmt.installing.doc/acmwd076.htm [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCTJ4_5.1.0/com.ibm.casemgmt.installing.doc/acmwd076.htm] \n\nHowever, this generates an uncaught TypeError as seen via Firebug. \n\n==> Uncaught TypeError: currentValues[index].substring is not a function \n\n \n\n In order to resolve this issue the Date property must to be converted to JSON as shown below.\n\n\"name\":\"Filter4\",\n\"value\": new Date().toJSON() \n\n \n\n \n\n2. Known Issue: List of add-ons that are required to create IBM Case Manager object stores on Content Platform Engine are incomplete in knowledge center. \n\nThe list of required add-ons in step 2 of Creating IBM Case Manager object stores on Content Platform Engine [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCTJ4_5.3.1/com.ibm.casemgmt.installing.doc/acmin048.htm] is incomplete. \n\nTo create IBM Case Manager object stores on Content Platform Engine, you must configure the following add-ons:\n\n\n * Content Engine Base Extensions, which are required for all Content Engine configurations. \n * Base Application Extensions, which are a prerequisite for Search Extensions and the Workplace Base Extensions. \n * Search Extensions, which are required to browse and search for content in IBM Content Navigator. \n * Workplace Base Extensions, which are required to browse and search for content in IBM Content Navigator \n * Workplace Template Extensions, which are required to open folders in IBM Content Navigator.\n\n\n\n3. Passing a payload to the 'Search with values' event for the Content List widget is not returning the correct results. \n\nThe incoming events page [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSCTJ4_5.3.1/com.ibm.casemgmt.help.doc/acmwc110.htm] for the Content List widget has the following information regarding the payload:\n\nAn array of JSON objects in which each object contains a property name and value pair that is used as criteria for the configured stored search.:\nname\nA string that contains the symbolic name of the property.\nvalue\nA string that contains the value of the property.\n\nHowever, the JSDocs for icm.pgwidget.contentlist.ContentList [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSCTJ4_5.3.1/com.ibm.casemgmt.development.doc/jsdoc/symbols/icm.pgwidget.contentlist.ContentList.html#handleICM_ReceiveSearchValuesEvent] class which contains a sample JSON for the payload to be passed for the 'Search with values' event shows the following:\n\nParameters:\n{Array} payload\nA list of properties each with name and value pair to be used as criteria for the configured stored search.\nA sample payload is: [{\"AT_companyName\": \"IBM\"}]\n\nWith the above payload passed in, the values will be ignored, and the search result will return more items than expected.\n\nThe correct sample payload should be:\n[{name:\"AT_companyName\",value:\"IBM\"}] \n\n\n4. After logging into Case Client, a delay is encountered before the user is presented with the solution work page.

The item is removed only from the solution definition. The item is not removed from the target object store or the Content Platform Engine.\n\nRemove any unused roles or in-baskets by using the Process Configuration Console.\n\nWhen you redeploy the solution, IBM\u00ae Case Manager does not remove properties or business objects from the case type definition class in the target object store. As a result, these items continue to appear in existing cases and are available when case workers create new cases of the case type. All active work items that reference case properties also continue to display the property values.\n\nIf you remove a property or business object from the case type definition class, it is removed from all existing cases and is not available for new cases. This action is destructive, data is loss on existing cases and can result in errors with running work items for properties. This action might require detailed review from all stakeholders of the cases. Task start changed from Manual or Automatic to Discretionary Not supported for all use cases If there are any existing regular task items with IBM Case Foundation process in waiting state, or in manual and ready state, the task process might not start, so the change is not recommended.

The baselining of the application is a process that uses a pre-defined mathematical and statistical method to automatically calculate a threshold based on response time information typically collected over a period of time (few days to few weeks.) \n\nBy default baselining gets enabled with a situation WasAppDiscoverd. This situation is enabled by default and will discover new applications then run a take action to start the baselining. So if this situation is not enabled then you should enable it and assign to the ITCAM App Server managing system list. \n\nYou want to do baselining with normal or typical load on the server over a period of few days to few weeks, or even few months. The performance of the application under this load is considered good (you will see \"Good\"\" in the Application Health views) and deviation from this performance indicates degrading health (\"Bad\" or \"Fair\" in the Application Health views) of the monitored application. \n\nTo start baselining for your application server, please follow these steps: \n\n(Note 1: in this example, I've used a WebSphere-based application but you can also do the same for any application on your J2EE agent also.) \n\n(Note 2: Before beginning baselining, make sure you have typical or normal load on the server to set the baselining threshold values.) \n\n1. Login to your TEPS, select Application Health, right-click on it, go to Workspace and select Application Registry. Look at the panels on the right and observe the baselining columns. If they're blank, your baselining has not been started. \n\n2. Next select Application Health, right-click on it, go to Workspace and select Application Health status. If you see Unknown, then you know the baselining has not started or not been calculated. \n\n3. High-lite your application, select the small yellow chain link in the first unnamed column and select Application Configuration Details. See screenshot here: \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21653905&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21653905&aid=1] \n\n4. In the bottom panel on the right select the line that says All and high-lite it. Then right-click it, select Take Action and Select. In the pull-down, select Start_Baselining and enter the Period (2 days), Update_Interval (every 2 hours), and Run_Clean set to 1 (clean start.) If you wish, you can change these values to whatever you want. \n\nSee screenshots here:\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21653905&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21653905&aid=2]\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21653905&amp;aid=3]\nHit OK twice and you should get a Command completed successfully message. (Note: If you get a Baselining_Already_Active message in the pop-up window, then you should do another Take Action and Stop_Baselining first if you want to do the baselining again.)\n\nOnce you have the baselining active, let it run for the period of time with typical load on the server. After the baselining is complete, the Unknown values in the Application Health should now change to Good or Fair or Bad depending on threshold values.\n\n \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Systems and Asset Management Tivoli Composite Application Manager for Web Resources ITCAM for Web Resources (J2EE TEMA) AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, Windows, Solaris Opteron 6.1, 6.2 Advanced \nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n ITCAM ITCAM4AD ITCAMfAD TEMA ITCAM for Web Resources", "document_id": "swg21653905", "all_doc_ids": ["swg1IZ98704", "isg3T1014926", "swg21532464", "swg21626967", "swg21427078", "swg21701123", "swg21348241", "swg1IV93359", "swg21986869", "swg1PI20472", "swg1PM43117", "swg1IV69383", "swg1PM07373", "swg21600368", "swg21597193", "swg1PK46000", "swg21502968", "swg1PM76054", "swg1PM20071", "swg21341457", "swg1PM29485", "swg21416947", "swg1IV64012", "isg3T1013847", "swg21539616", "swg21283098", "swg1PM73277", "swg1IZ62255", "swg1PM48428", "swg1PM93403", "swg21400486", "swg21458247", "swg1PM32727", "swg1IV27682", "isg3T1026403", "swg1IV68708", "swg21653905", "swg1PM73703", "swg21525274", "swg1PK75213", "swg1PM22142", "swg1IZ68077", "swg1PM69120", "isg3T1014993", "swg21571932", "swg1PM14697", "swg21538626", "swg1PM49946", "swg21537024", "swg21600392"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "My UCD server has so many files in /opt/ibm-ucd/server/var/sa/dialogue that ls goes out of memory trying to list them all.

@GeneratedValue\n   int idParent;\n   String child_ref;\n   @OneToOne\n   @JoinColumn(name = \"CHILD_REF\", table =\n   \"ParentSecondaryTable\", referencedColumnName = \"idChild\")\n   PChild child;\n   }\n   The column \"CHILD_REF\" will be ignored and the runtime will\n   look for the Foreign Key in non-existent column\n   ParentSecondaryTable.CHILD_IDCHILD.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\n *  With this fix, code has been added to OpenJPA to ensure the\n   JoinColumn annotation's name field is not ignored in a\n   unidirectional OneToOne mapping that is in a SecondaryTable\n   \n   The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for\n   inclusion in Service Levels (Fix Packs) 8.0.0.6 and\n   8.5.0.2 of WebSphere Application Server versions 8.0.0 and\n

This may be necessary when you've installed ITCAM as a certain user and need to run as a different user. To see the Service permissions you can use the \"sc\" command from a Windows command-line prompt. \n\nTo compare permissions for a particular Service, run it on two systems. See the outputs and compare each line in a notepad/wordpad session.\n\nHere's an example of using the Windows command \"sc\" and a Service called TCsiteStandard216.\n\n(Note: The \"sc\" command is in the C:\\Windows\\System32 dir. So if this directory is not in your direct path, you'll have to run it from the C:\\Windows\\System32 directory.)\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21509503&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21509503&aid=1]\n\n \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Systems and Asset Management Tivoli Composite Application Manager for Application Diagnostics ITCAM for APPLICATION DIAGNOSTICS Agent for WebSphere Windows 7.1 \nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n ITCAM4AD ITCAMfAD ITCAM4J2EE ITCAM for J2EE", "document_id": "swg21509503", "all_doc_ids": ["swg21967756", "swg21509505", "swg21672979", "swg21682163", "swg21654993", "swg21509504", "swg21655376", "swg21679900", "swg1PM17746", "swg21321514", "swg21971827", "swg21694886", "swg1PI27310", "swg21985628", "swg21499578", "swg21394195", "swg21609290", "swg21902438", "swg21402914", "swg21496473", "swg21688744", "swg1PM17737", "swg21680111", "swg21665811", "swg1PM17795", "swg24033537", "swg21606547", "swg1PM17749", "swg21383638", "swg21700308", "swg21509503", "swg21680317", "swg1PM17755", "swg1PM17820", "swg1PM17754", "swg21390738", "swg21680319", "swg21427737", "swg21499971", "swg1PM17799", "swg24015775", "swg21976648", "swg21966304", "swg1PM17714", "swg21968701", "swg1PM17745", "swg1PM24854", "swg1PM17615", "swg21568685", "swg1PM69606"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Why am I receiving an message DFHAC2236 with an abend AEXZ each time that I attempt to startup a newly installed CICS Configuration Manager (CICS CM) server using the CCVI transaction?

What can be the cause? \n\nCAUSE\nPossible cause is that you have installed recently a new ISM agent support on TEMS/TEPS, but you have not yet cleared the Java cache on the problematic admin user machine.\n\nANSWER\nISM fixpack or interim fix potentially includes new .jar binaries for the ISM configuration tool accessible via TEP JavaWebStart (JavaWS) client. So the Java cache needs to be cleared on all machines from which one admin user is accessing the TEP ISM Configuration GUI via Java web start. On the problematic environment, it's very likely that old .jar files are still in use, while ISM agent support is at higher level on TEPS side. \n\n\nSee details below on how to clear the Java cache on the problematic client machine \n\n####################################################################### \n\n1.

Federated Repositories supports referrals to other LDAP servers. After setting up WebSphere Commerce with LDAP using referrals, a user attempts to log into WebSphere Commerce to test the LDAP configuration, however an exception is generated. \n\nSYMPTOM\nWhen an existing user, for example. wcsadmin, first attempts to log into WebSphere Commerce after the system has been configured with LDAP, the user is automatically created in the LDAP server if the user does not already exist there. During this user creation process, the following exception is generated: \n\n[9/21/10 21:38:40:029 GMT] 00000339 exception E com.ibm.ws.wim.adapter.ldap.LdapConnection createSubcontext CWWIM4520E The 'javax.naming.PartialResultException: [LDAP: error code 10 - Referral]; remaining name 'uid=wcsadmin,ou=ibmgroups,ou=groups,o=ibm.com'; resolved object com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtx@1e9c356' naming exception occurred during processing.\n\n[9/21/10 21:38:40:042 GMT] 00000339 exception E com.ibm.ws.wim.adapter.ldap.LdapConnection createSubcontext com.ibm.websphere.wim.exception.WIMSystemException: CWWIM4520E The 'javax.naming.PartialResultException: [LDAP: error code 10 - Referral]; remaining name 'uid=wcsadmin,ou=ibmgroups,ou=groups,o=ibm.com'; resolved object com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtx@1e9c356' naming exception occurred during processing.\nat com.ibm.ws.wim.adapter.ldap.LdapConnection.createSubcontext(LdapConnection.java:816)\nat com.ibm.ws.wim.adapter.ldap.LdapAdapter.create(LdapAdapter.java:391)\nat com.ibm.ws.wim.ProfileManager.createImpl(ProfileManager.java:591)\nat com.ibm.ws.wim.ProfileManager.genericProfileManagerMethod(ProfileManager.java:298)\nat com.ibm.ws.wim.ProfileManager.create(ProfileManager.java:344)\nat com.ibm.websphere.wim.ServiceProvider.create(ServiceProvider.java:314)\nat com.ibm.websphere.wim.client.LocalServiceProvider.create(LocalServiceProvider.java:356)\nat com.ibm.commerce.member.syncbeans.VMMProxy$1.run(VMMProxy.java:696)\nat com.ibm.ws.security.auth.ContextManagerImpl.runAs(ContextManagerImpl.java:4575)\nat com.ibm.ws.security.auth.ContextManagerImpl.runAsSystem(ContextManagerImpl.java:4663)\nat com.ibm.commerce.member.syncbeans.VMMProxy.createMember(VMMProxy.java:706)\nat com.ibm.commerce.member.syncbeans.SyncBeanBase.createInLDAP(SyncBeanBase.java:824)\nat com.ibm.commerce.member.syncbeans.SyncBeanBase.update(SyncBeanBase.java:1668)\nat com.ibm.commerce.security.commands.\nWMMAuthenticationCmdImpl.performExecute(WMMAuthenticationCmdImpl.java:483)\nat com.ibm.commerce.command.ECCommandTarget.executeCommand(ECCommandTarget.java:157)\n\n\nCAUSE\nThis error typically occurs due to incorrect set up of LDAP with WebSphere Commerce when referrals are used.

Prerequisites \n 2. What is the Match Database\u2019s purpose? \n 3. Setting the database up. \n 4. Configuring the Match Designer for use with the Database. \n 5. On going maintenance \n\n\nPrerequisites \nThe following must exist before using the Match Designer functionality.  1. Match Specification built for use in match designer. \n 2. Create a data set that contains the data you will run the match analysis on. \n 3. Create a corresponding frequency data set to be used in the match analysis. \n 4. DSN for local PC \n 5. Create Database in which to perform the Match analysis processing. \n    a) Sizing of Database \n    b) Character sets required \n    c) Permission's for users \n\n\nAdditional information is also available with in the WebSphere QualityStage User Guide. \n\nWhat it\u2019s the Match Database\u2019s purpose?  1. The results Database is used to test the match specifications (logic) designed for use in match jobs. \n 2. This functionality enables the user to get a baseline of how good the match criteria are, based on the match logic developed for use in the application. \n 3. The results Database stores statistics and match results based on your data. For Example: How many matches, duplicates, and unmatched records. \n 4. This functionality allows developers to change matching logic on the fly and retest within minutes. \n\n * There is nothing from this Database that is used in production runs so it should never be created on or moved to a production box. \n * The Match Designer is to be used for development purposes only with a \"subset\" of the full volume data. If additional match modifications are required continue to use a subset of data not conduct testing with full volume data. \n * Determining the subset size of data to use in the Match Designer will vary depending on the clients environment and resources. Each client should run several iterations to determine the optimal subset to utilize in the Match Designer step. \n * To obtain the most accurate matching thresholds a full volume run should be performed in the DataStage Designer.\n\n\nCreating the Database  1. You should start from an empty Database; using the default XMETA Database is not recommended because it can become corrupt. \n 2. There are certain requirements on how the Database is to be created. \n    a) If Oracle: CHARACTERSET should be set to AL32UTF \n    b) If SQL: default is fine. \n    c) If DB2: create as codepage UTF-8 and page size 32K \n    d) Permission\u2019s - Each user has to have the ability to create tables, write and read rights in the DB. \n    e) The minimum DB space required will be calculated as follows = Number of Passes in match specification (X) Number of Input Records (X) Input Record Length (+) 100 filler.\n    f) If this is a distributed installation, you need to have ODBC defined in your client and on the server. They must have the same name. \n\n\nConfiguring the Match Designer for use with the Database  1.  Via the DataStage Designer navigate to the your match specification to work with \n 2.  Double click and a window will appear indicating: \n     \u201cThe ODBC Data Source Name (xxxxxxx) currently specified for this Match could not be found. Please create a DSN by this name or run a Test Environment Update to configure a different DSN for this Specification.\u201d \n 3.  Select the \u201cOK\u201d button \n 4.  Select option \u201cConfigure Specification\u201d \n 5.  From drop down select \u201cTest Environment\u201d \n 6.  For \u201cSample Information\u201d navigate to the location of your data set(s) created for analysis. \n 7.  Under \u201cFrequency Information\u201d navigate to the location of your frequency data set(s) created for use. \n 8.  Section \u201cTest Results Database\u201d fill the following information in. \n     a. Select the DSN created for the will allow the connection to the Database. \n     b. Enter user name required \n     c. Password required \n     d. Test Connection \n     e. Configuration File Location; these are the nodes located in your environment for use. Please make sure this matches the location of where the data sets reside on the server. \n 9.  Once connection is established hit the \u201cUpdate\u201d button. This will populate the Database with the required fields (not data) to populate when you perform the test specification. \n 10. The final step is to perform the Test All Passes. Please note this make take a few moments depending on the size of the files used. \n\n\nOngoing Maintenance  1. For each new run, results are cleared and rewritten to the DB. \n 2. Each user should have their own respective Databases to avoid rewriting over previous results. \n 3. There are separate tables holding results for each design. And from one user it is no problem to use a single Database and multiple designs. \n 4. Per the recommendation above in \"Creating the Database\" this database should not be your XMETA database. If you used the XMETA DO NOT RUN THIS STEP.

How do I use this tool? \n\nANSWER\nWpcollector is a command line tool that automates the collection of portal logs and configuration files. Using automated log collection early in the Case life cycle can greatly reduce the number of doc requests that are made by Support. \n\nWpcollector is delivered with WebSphere Portal beginning with the 7.0 release. If tracing is required for the problem scenario, you must manually enable traceStrings and recreate the problem PRIOR to running wpcollector. \n\nTo run wpcollector, please follow the steps, below:\n\n\n\n * If IBM Support has requested tracing, enable it as instructed by the L2 Support Engineer and then recreate the problem. If no tracing is requested, proceed to the step, below: \n   \n\n\n * If using Microsoft Windows, Unix/Linux, or IBM i, run the following script from the <wp_profile_root> [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHRKX_8.5.0/mp/reference/wpsdirstr.dita]/PortalServer/bin/ directory to begin the collection:  * \n    * \n    *  Unix/Linux: wpcollector.sh \n    *  i: wpcollector.sh \n    *  \n    * Tip: To specify the option for collecting files for the Deployment Manager profile, use the \"dmgr.root\" parameter. For example: \n    *  wpcollector.bat -Ddmgr.root=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/profiles/dmgr_profile\n   \n   \n * If using IBM z/OS, proceed as follows [../reference/wpsdirstr.html%5C]:  * \n    * \n    *  In the Portal configuration panel, select Collect Diagnostics. \n    *  Follow the Customization Dialog instructions for submitting the Collect Diagnostics job (EJPSLOGS). \n    *  \n    * Tip: To collect data from the Deployment Manager, the only requirement is to submit the job from the system where the Deployment Manager is installed (i.e. so it can access the files). There is no prompt in the ISPF panel for this.\n   \n   \n * Locate the wp.mustgather-<timestamp>.zip file in the <wp_profile_root> [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHRKX_8.5.0/mp/reference/wpsdirstr.dita]/filesForAutoPD/ directory and follow the instructions in \"Exchanging information with IBM Technical Support for problem determination\" [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21153852] to manually FTP the collection to IBM. If using z/OS, there may be additional z/OS-specific files required, such as WebSphere Portal servant region or controller region joblogs. Wpcollector currently does not collect these files. Your L2 Support Engineer will inform you in the event these files are needed and provide instructions for collecting them. \n   \n\n\n * If tracing was requested and enabled, please follow the instructions provided by the L2 Support Engineer to disable tracing from the environment\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Data Collection and Symptom Analysis [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHRKX_8.5.0/mp/trouble/tbl_apdt_over.dita?lang=en]", "document_id": "swg21445430", "all_doc_ids": ["swg21963147", "swg21445430", "swg21243923", "swg21968713", "swg21461951", "swg21461436", "swg21997740", "swg21989372", "swg21631672", "swg21498003", "swg21461932", "swg21681272", "swg21636350", "swg21579527", "swg21449856", "swg21497122", "swg21962321", "swg21672901", "swg21962645", "swg21590976", "swg22008133", "swg21591590", "swg21593369", "swg1PK89495", "swg21451423", "swg21966956", "swg21592791", "swg21458362", "swg21639318", "swg21629755", "swg1HD45351", "swg21519798", "swg21592792", "swg21447938", "swg21449873", "swg21313734", "swg21593367", "swg21663574", "swg21580345", "swg21449915", "swg21579530", "swg21459962", "swg1IO14839", "swg1JR40382", "swg21679425", "swg21668460", "swg21453991", "swg21377161", "swg1PK89496", "swg21450830"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Where can I find information for Security bulletin: Malicious File Download vulnerability in IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) and WebSphere Lombardi Edition (WLE) - CVE-2016-9693?

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to impersonate a TLS server and obtain credentials.\nCVSS Base Score: 7.1\nCVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/109415] for the current score\nCVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined\nCVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)\n\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS\nReleases 6.1, 7.1 and 7.2 of IBM i are affected. \n\nREMEDIATION/FIXES\nThe issue can be fixed by applying a PTF to the IBM i Operating System and products.\nReleases 6.1, 7.1 and 7.2 of IBM i are supported and will be fixed. \n\nhttp://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/ [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/]\nRelease 6.1.1 \u2013 MF60292\nRelease 7.1 \u2013 SI59229, MF61242, MF60291\nRelease 7.2 \u2013 SI59230, MF61243, MF60290\n\n5770UME:\nCIM 1.3: SI59244\nCIM 1.4: SI59193\n\n\nImportant note: IBM recommends that all users running unsupported versions of affected products upgrade to supported and fixed version of affected products.\n\nWORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS\nYou should verify applying this configuration change does not cause any compatibility issues. Not disabling the MD5 signature hash will expose yourself to the attack described above. IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas where you have enabled the MD5 signature hash and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. \n\nMitigation instructions for IBM i:\n\nIBM i System SSL/TLS \n\nIBM i System SSL/TLS is a set of generic services provided in the IBM i Licensed Internal Code (LIC) to protect TCP/IP communications using the SSL/TLS protocol. \n\nSystem SSL/TLS is accessible to application developers from the following programming interfaces and JSSE implementation: \n\n- Global Security Kit (GSKit) APIs \n- Integrated IBM i SSL_ APIs \n- Integrated IBM i JSSE implementation (IBMi5OSJSSEProvider)\n\nTLS applications created by IBM, IBM business partners, independent software vendors (ISV), or customers that use one of the three System SSL/TLS interfaces listed above will use System SSL/TLS. For example, FTP and Telnet are IBM applications that use System SSL/TLS. Not all TLS enabled applications running on IBM i use System SSL/TLS.\n\nThe TLSv1.2 protocol made the signature and hash algorithms that are used for digital signatures an independent attribute. Previously the negotiated cipher suite determined these algorithms. System SSL/TLS has the infrastructure to support multiple signature algorithms. The signature and hash algorithm RSA_MD5 is allowed in the System SSL/TLS default configuration. \n\nThe application developer determines which signature algorithms are supported by the application when it is designed. \n- Few if any applications expose the signature algorithm configuration to the end user. For those applications RSA_MD5 can be disabled through that application specific configuration. \n- Most applications do not provide a configuration option for controlling the signature and hash algorithms. It is difficult to determine if these applications support RSA_MD5 however it is likely they do support it.\n- Almost all applications use the System SSL/TLS default signature algorithms such as FTP and Telnet.\n\nAfter loading the System SSL/TLS fixes listed in this bulletin, applications coded to use the default values will no longer negotiate TLSv1.2 secure sessions that use RSA_MD5. The fix has no impact on TLSv1.1, TLSv1.0, or SSLv3 connections. It is unlikely that RSA_MD5 is being used for any handshake message digital signatures in your environment. However, if an RSA_MD5 digital server or client certificate is configured, it will no longer work. The MD5 based certificate should be replaced with a SHA2 based certificate. RSA_SHA1 certificates are not recommended for continued use however this fix does not remove RSA_SHA1 from the default signature algorithm list. \n\nIf RSA_MD5 support is required by an application after this PTF is applied, RSA_MD5 can be added back in two ways: \n\n1. If the dependent application has a DCM application definition, update the \"SSL signature algorithms\" application definition field for that application to explicitly include RSA_MD5. \n\n2. RSA_MD5 can be added back to the System SSL/TLS default signature algorithm list using System Service Tools (SST) Advanced Analysis Command SSLCONFIG. To change the System SSL/TLS settings with the Start System Service Tools (STRSST) command, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open a character based interface.\n2. On the command line, type STRSST.\n3. Type your service tools user name and password.\n4. Select option 1 (Start a service tool).\n5. Select option 4 (Display/Alter/Dump).\n6. Select option 1 (Display/Alter storage).\n7. Select option 2 (Licensed Internal Code (LIC) data).\n8. Select option 14 (Advanced analysis).\n9. Select option 1 (SSLCONFIG).\n10. Enter -h\n\nThis will show the help screen that describes the input strings to change the System SSL/TLS setting for -signatureAlgorithmList which determines the default list. \n\nSystem SSL/TLS\u2019s support of RSA_MD5 can be completely disabled at the system level using SSLCONFIG. Follow the above SSLCONFIG instructions but change the setting for -supportedSignatureAlgorithmList.\n\n\nOpenSSL \n\n\nExisting versions of OpenSSL used on IBM i are not affected. It is recommended that you apply all fixes from the IBM i security PTF group in order to stay current on all fixes. \n\nGET NOTIFIED ABOUT FUTURE SECURITY BULLETINS\n Subscribe to My Notifications [ http://www-01.ibm.com/software/support/einfo.html] to be notified of important product support alerts like this. \n\nREFERENCES\nComplete CVSS v3 Guide [http://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide] \nOn-line Calculator v3 [http://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0] \n\nRELATED INFORMATION\nIBM Secure Engineering Web Portal [http://www.ibm.com/security/secure-engineering/bulletins.html] \nIBM Product Security Incident Response Blog [http://www.ibm.com/blogs/psirt] \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nReported to IBM by Karthikeyan Bhargavan at INRIA in Paris, France. \n\n*The CVSS Environment Score is customer environment specific and will ultimately impact the Overall CVSS Score.

To set the HTTP Session time-out at the server level, navigate to Servers > Application Servers > Your Server > Web Container > Session Management. \n\nIn the Session time-out section of this window, you can select No time-out or Set time-out by clicking the appropriate radio button. If you choose to set the time-out, type the desired value in minutes in the box. \n\n\n2. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Enterprise Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Session Management. \n\nCheck Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the application session to overwrite those values set at the parent, which in this case is the Server level. \n\n\n3. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Web Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Web Module > Your Web App.war > Session Management. \n\nCheck Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the Application Session to overwrite those values set at the parent levels, which in this case is the Server or Enterprise Application level. \n\nAfter modifying these settings, save the master configuration. \n\nSetting HTTP Session time-out when application is packaged \n\nThe application developer can also select to set the HTTP Session time-out parameter when the application is packaged. This value is stored in the web.xml file for the Web application. \n\nThis setting overrides any session time-outs defined from the Administrative Console. Alter this setting by repackaging the application with a new value, or by modifying the web.xml file. The entry in the web.xml will be as follows: \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<session-config> \n      * \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<session-timeout>60</session-timeout>\n * \n * \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </session-config>\n\n \n\nWhere the \"session-timeout\" is an integer value for the desired session time-out in minutes. \nSetting HTTP Session time-out from the application code \n\nFinally, the HTTP Session time-out can be set in the application code. The programmer can invoke the setMaxInactiveInterval() method on HttpSession object to set the time-out value as desired. This setting overrides any time-out defined in the application package or made from the Administrative Console. \n\nHTTP Session time-out Override Precedence Summary \n\nThe list below shows the precedence from which the final HTTP Session time-out is derived. \n\n1.

The EventReader captures the event and then uses the highest captured StateChange value in its outgoing SQL to capture pertinent events.\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nPertinent events are not being processed. Looking in the EventReader log file the number of events being captured in each Read is 0. Testing the SQL being used in an nco_sql session produces a 0 result too. Testing the SQL again in an nco_sql session without the \"and StateChange >= 1234567890\" clause returns all the unprocessed rows.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nSomething has \"future dated\" the StateChange value of an event in the ObjectServer, the EventReader captured the event and, since the EventReader will use the highest StateChange value captured in the previous poll in the SQL of its next poll, this then future dated the value used in the EventReader. The EventReader will persist with this value (and will increment it by 1 every other poll) until such a time as it captures an event with a higher StateChange value.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe simplest solution is to manually reset the EventReader StateChange value via the GUI. Stop the EventReader, open it for edit, click the \"Clear State\" button, exit the editor and restart the EventReader.\n\nAn alternate solution is to perform this operation via the Command Line Interface:\n\n\n\n * telnet [Hostname] [Port]\n\n\nwhere [Hostname] is the resolvable hostname of the ImpactServer host and [Port] is the CLI port number (2000, by default). You will need to supply a suitable username (admin, for example) and password. Then at the READY prompt enter the series of commands: \n\n * Update Service set Running=false where Name='[EventReaderName]';\n * \n * Update Service set ClearState=true where Name='[EventReaderName]';\n * \n * Update Service set Running=true where Name='[EventReaderName]';\n\n\nwhere [EventReaderName] is the name of the EventReader that requires this restart process. \n\nIn cases where the likelihood of StateChange being inappropriately incremented in this fashion is quite high, one might wish to automate this process and have a Policy hunt for such occurrences. Please find following an example of a \"hunter\" Policy to capture any reoccurrence of this issue: \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * ANN=\"AcquireStateChange\"; \n   Log(2,ID+ANN); \n   Script=\"/opt/IBM/netcool/impact/bin/CheckState.sh\"; \n   Parameter=\"password\"; \n   JRExecAction(Script, Parameter, false, 30); \n   NumExecOutput=Length(ExecOutput); \n   Log(3,ID+ANN+\": NumExecOutput: \"+NumExecOutput); \n   \n   If(NumExecOutput >= 1) \n   {  * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * Log(ID+ANN+\": CurrentStateChange: \"+HumanStateChange+\" is greater than CurrentTime: \"+HumanCurrentTime); \n      Log(ID+ANN+\": !!!

Also, in latter versions of Impact, the username and password should be those of the tipadmin. Additionally, rather than have the password sitting clear case in a script one can pass it as a JRExecAction Parameter from the Policy - still clear case but the relevance of the variable can be made less obvious. \n\nBoth of these scripts are called by the JRExecAction() function in the example Policy and this in turn requires the JRExecServer to be running on the ImpactServer host(s *). \n\n* - The JRExecServer will be used by the current Primary ImpactServer only, as all EventReaders and PolicyActivators are run on the current Primary only but, if and when failover occurs and the Secondary ImpactServer becomes Primary, this new Primary will require access to a running, local JRExecServer. So, JRExecServer has to be running on both Primary and Secondary ImpactServer hosts to ensure availability in case of failover.

This feature can be configured in DataPower as it uses client connection with queue manager SVRCONN channel. \nThe default setting of sharing conversations (SHARECNV) value is zero in DataPower mq-qm object. The same default value for MQ SVRCONN channel is 10. The sharing conversations value is \nnegotiated between MQ server and DataPower and the lower value takes effect. However, in current versions of the DataPower firmware, the sharing conversations setting of 1 is treated as 0 when negotiating with MQ server.\n\nThere are three use cases to configure Sharing Conversations in DataPower mq-qm object: \n\nCase #1 : The negotiated sharing conversations value is 0 - The channel runs in a mode similar to WebSphere MQ V6 and does not uses features such as\n\n\u00b7 Administrator stop-quiesce\n\u00b7 Heartbeating \n\u00b7 Read ahead \n\u00b7 Client asynchronous consume\n\nSet a value of 0 or 1 on the Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower to disable sharing conversations regardless of the IBM WebSphere MQ SVRCONN setting.\n\nCase #2: The negotiated sharing conversations value is 1 - The channel supports IBM WebSphere MQ V7 and later release features as outlined in case #1, but each TCP/IP channel instance has a single conversation.\n\nSet a value of 1 on the Sharing Conversations attribute and select \"on\" in Share Single Conversation attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower as shown in the following picture and a value of 1 on IBM WebSphere MQ SVRCONN setting.\n\nThe Share Single Conversation attribute is only visible when \"Sharing Conversations\" is configured with value of \"1\" and then <RETURN> key is entered. For values greater than 1, the \"Share Single Conversation\" attribute is hidden in the mq-qm object.\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21647231&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21647231&aid=1] \n\nCase #3: The negotiated sharing conversations value is 2 or more - The channel supports IBM WebSphere MQ 7 and later release features and each TCP/IP channel instance supports 2 or more conversations.\n\nSet a value of 2 or more on the Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower and on the MQ SVRCONN channel.\n\nOn average, processing of messages from client applications is 15 percent slower when using SHARECNV(10) as compared to SHARECNV(0). Please refer to Performance Implications of Sharing [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.0.1/com.ibm.mq.csqzaf.doc/mi12240_.htm]\nConversations on Client-connection Channels. [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.0.1/com.ibm.mq.csqzaf.doc/mi12240_.htm].\n\nSince DataPower uses a connection pool in processing MQ messages, there are no additional benefits of using sharing conversations with the mq-qm object. However, in situations when mixed message sizes are used by the same mq-qm object, using case #2 will benefit mq-qm object as it will use new buffer management feature of IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7 when making MQGET API call.\n\nWhen using a negotiated shared conversations value of 0 as in case #1, mq-qm object uses maximum message size as the buffer pool for the MQGET API call. However, when mixed message sizes are processed by the same MQ Front Side Handler (FSH), it requests buffer pool based on maximum message size configured in the mq-qm object. The use of fixed buffer pool for small and large messages can deplete MQ server's allocated buffer and contribute to unexpected termination of MQ SVRCONN channel instance and may terminate the queue manager. In such a situation, using a negotiated sharing conversations value of 1 as in case #2 will benefit DataPower mq-qm object as it will use IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7 Read Ahead feature and the new buffer management feature for MQGET API call. IBM WebSphere MQ V8 release provides enhanced performance for case #2, when the negotiated sharing conversations value is 1.\n\nFor DataPower firmware releases 7.0.0.x, 7.1.0.x, 7.2.0.x and earlier, one should follow case #1 and use a negotiated sharing conversations value of 0. If you configure these firmware versions with case #2 or case #3, DataPower device may reload or hang due to connection instability and generate many MQ errors with Reason Code - 2009 and 2059. \n\nCases #2 and #3 can be used in firmware releases 7.5.0.x, 7.5.1.x and later. We suggest to use a value of 10 or less in Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object and verify the configuration empirically to make sure that IBM WebSphere MQ server can sustain load from DataPower with the negotiated Sharing Conversations of 10.\n\nNote: In order to use sharing conversations, make sure you have applied APAR IV24821 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV24821] (\"Client C application process hangs after cancelling thread\") to the IBM WebSphere MQ server. IV24821 is included in IBM WebSphere MQ V7.0.1.10 and later, IBM WebSphere MQ V7.1.0.3 and later, IBM WebSphere MQ V7.5.0.1 and later, and IBM WebSphere MQ V8.\n\nIn order to identify the negotiated Sharing Conversations status, the following MQ commands are used in the distributed platform.\n\nrunmqsc <qmgr>\ndisplay chs(CHANNEL3) maxshcnv curshcnv\n\ndisplay chs(CHANNEL3) maxshcnv curshcnv\n1 : display chs(CHANNEL3) maxshcnv curshcnv\nAMQ8417: Display Channel Status details.\nCHANNEL(CHANNEL3) CHLTYPE(SVRCONN)\nCONNAME(9.x1.x2.x3) CURRENT\nSTATUS(RUNNING) SUBSTATE(RECEIVE)\nCURSHCNV(1) MAXSHCNV(1) <---- Negotiated Sharing Conversations value of 1\nAMQ8417: Display Channel Status details.\nCHANNEL(CHANNEL3) CHLTYPE(SVRCONN)\nCONNAME(9.y1.y2.y31) CURRENT\nSTATUS(RUNNING) SUBSTATE(RECEIVE)\nCURSHCNV(0) MAXSHCNV(0) <---- Negotiated Sharing Conversations value of 0\n\nend\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn order to identify the negotiated Sharing Conversations status, the following MQ commands are used in the z/OS System.\n\n\n\nconnect to <qmgr>\nOn z/OS system, options for issuing the commands are described at http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm.mq.ref.adm.doc/q085120_.htm [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm.mq.ref.adm.doc/q085120_.htm]. \n/+RTP8 DIS CHSTATUS(channel_name) MAXSHCNV CURSHCNV\nwhere \"+RTP8\" is the command prefix.", "document_id": "swg21647231", "all_doc_ids": ["swg21647231", "swg1IC91594", "swg1IT16873", "swg1IC69197", "swg1IT02476", "swg1IC91486", "swg1IT10128", "swg1IT18157", "swg1IT14409", "swg1IT10498", "swg1IC89569", "swg1IV47785", "swg1IT17153", "swg1IZ33379", "swg1IC99575", "swg1IZ69682", "swg1IT16786", "swg1IT04771", "swg1IZ85904", "swg1IT09442", "swg1PK73643", "swg1PI19721", "swg1IT08838", "swg1IZ52693", "swg1IT22127", "swg1IC58543", "swg1IC79037", "swg1PM26590", "swg1IV03127", "swg1PI18232", "swg1PI64465", "swg1PI68897", "swg1PM52894", "swg1PM54883", "swg1PM54201", "swg1PK77094", "swg1IC66174", "swg1PK95837", "swg1PK64466", "swg1IZ75511", "swg1PI55507", "swg1PM81116", "swg21299323", "swg1IZ54543", "swg1PM52877", "swg1PK83207", "swg1PI95423", "swg21166048", "swg1IT18242", "swg24023356"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Why would CIUSNTSR stored procedure creation fail with message DSNT408I and SQLCODE=-401?

The resource adapter implements the JCA V1.5 interfaces and can be used in J2EE 1.4 (or later) compliant application servers to access the resources of a WebSphere MQ queue manager. \n\nUsing the resource adapter with WebSphere Application Server Version 7 and Version 8\nThe WebSphere MQ messaging provider in WebSphere Application Server Version 7 and Version 8 includes a version of the WebSphere MQ resource adapter. The version of the resource adapter supplied with the Application Server should be used in these environment. \n\nUpdates to the WebSphere MQ resource adapter that is installed with the application server are included in WebSphere Application Server Fix Packs.\n\nFor more details please see:\n\nInformation about using the WebSphere MQ messaging provider for WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/prodconn/v1r0m0/topic/com.ibm.scenarios.wmqwasusing.doc/topics/swg21316899.htm]\n\nInformation about using the WebSphere MQ messaging provider for WebSphere Application Server Version 8.0 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/prodconn/v1r0m0/topic/com.ibm.scenarios.wmqwasusing.doc/topics/swg21498708.htm]\n[http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/prodconn/v1r0m0/topic/com.ibm.scenarios.wmqwasusing.doc/topics/swg21498708.htm]\nInformation about using the WebSphere MQ messaging provider for WebSphere Application Server Version 8.5 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/prodconn/v1r0m0/topic/com.ibm.scenarios.wmqwasusing.doc/topics/swg21498708_85.htm]\n\nIdentifying which WebSphere MQ client is shipped with WebSphere Application Server [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/prodconn/v1r0m0/topic/com.ibm.scenarios.wmqwasusing.doc/topics/swg21248089.htm]\n\n\nUsing the resource adapter with WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1\nThe resource adapter must not be used with WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1. To access the resources of a WebSphere MQ queue manager from within WebSphere Application Server, use the WebSphere MQ messaging provider. [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/prodconn/v1r0m0/topic/com.ibm.scenarios.wmqwasusing.doc/topics/swg21307203.htm]\nInformation about using WebSphere MQ as the JMS Provider for WebSphere Application Server Version 6.1 [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/prodconn/v1r0m0/topic/com.ibm.scenarios.wmqwasusing.doc/topics/swg21307203.htm] \n\n\nUsing the resource adapter with other application servers\nFor all other J2EE 1.4 (or later) compliant application servers, problems following successful completion of the WebSphere MQ resource adapter Installation Verification Test (IVT) can be reported to IBM for the investigation of WebSphere MQ product trace and other WebSphere MQ diagnostic information. If the WebSphere MQ resource adapter IVT cannot be run successfully, problems encountered are likely to be caused by incorrect deployment or incorrect resource definitions which are application server specific and the problems should be investigated using application server documentation and / or the support organization for that application server.\n\nIBM has tested the resource adapter on the application servers listed below\n\n\n * WebSphere Application Server Community Edition V2.1.1.5 \n * JBoss Application Server V6.0.0\n\n\nExample scripts and detailed instructions for running the IVT with JBoss V6.0.0 and WAS CE V2.1.1.5 can be found in the WebSphere MQ 7.1 and V7.5 Information Centers. \n\n\nGeneral issues \n\nSession interleaving is not supported: \nSome application servers provide a capability called session interleaving, where the same JMS session can be used in multiple transactions, although it is only enlisted in one at a time. This is not supported by the WebSphere MQ resource adapter, and can lead to the issues shown below: \n * An attempt to put a message to a WebSphere MQ queue fails with reason code 2072 (MQRC_SYNCPOINT_NOT_AVAILABLE). \n * Calls to xa_close() fail with reason code -3 (XAER_PROTO), and an FDC with probe ID AT040010 is generated on the WebSphere MQ queue manager being accessed from the application server.\n\n\nPlease see your application server documentation for how to disable this capability. \n\n\n\nJava\u2122 Transaction API (JTA) Specification of how XA resources are recovered for XA transaction recovery: \nSection 3.4.8 of the JTA specification does not define a specific mechanism by which XA resources are recreated to perform XA transactional recovery. As such, it is up to each individual transaction manager (and therefore application server) how XA resources involved in an XA transaction are recovered. It is possible that, for some application servers, the WebSphere MQ resource adapter does not implement the application server specific mechanism utilized to perform XA transactional recovery. \n\nIBM has tested XA transactional recovery with the WebSphere MQ 7.1 resource adapter on the following application servers: \n * WebSphere Application Server V7.0, V8.0 and V8.5. \n * WebSphere Application Server Community Edition V2.1.1.5 \n * JBoss Application Server V6.0.0\n\n\n\nORIGINAL PUBLICATION DATE\n 2011/10/11 \n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n WMQ MQ", "document_id": "swg27023129", "all_doc_ids": ["swg1PI74862", "swg1PM31880", "swg24043427", "swg1PI53190", "swg1PM77968", "swg1PI35905", "swg1PI70191", "swg1PI31576", "swg1PM67639", "swg21622719", "swg1PI50816", "swg1PI84053", "swg27023129", "swg1PI89985", "swg1PI06627", "swg1PM89233", "swg1PM78359", "swg1PI07338", "swg1PM41741", "swg1PM19399", "swg1PM70847", "swg1PI96625", "swg1PM09742", "swg1PK81443", "swg1PM53787", "swg27009524", "swg22000350", "swg21647169", "swg24023356", "swg1PM46219", "swg1IV19480", "swg1PK83207", "swg1PI74468", "swg1PI74874", "swg1IZ05176", "swg21668491", "swg24021547", "swg24043424", "swg24043423", "swg1IZ30693", "swg21633761", "swg27041968", "swg21617873", "swg1IT19847", "swg1IV59333", "swg21598341", "swg1JR54601", "swg22000140", "swg22000737", "swg1IC76463"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How do I recreate all the Oracle Text indexes for the Atlas database ?

For example, after importing data from a production database to a test database, the Oracle Text indexes will not be transferred. This will require you to recreate them in order for certain functions in Atlas to work properly. \n\nIf you have access to the Atlas release files from the version you are currently using you can follow these instructions. You will need the ability to access the Atlas database using the Oracle SQL Plus tool. \n\n \n\n 1. Shutdown the application server running the Atlas applications. \n 2. Locate the script drop_ctxsys_indexes.sql to drop the Oracle Text indexes from the following folder in the Atlas release:\n    Atlas\\Schema\\Deploy\\smf\\db\\etc\\oracle \n 3.

This component firmware includes the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI), Integrated Management Module (IMM), and Dynamic System Analysis (DSA). \n\nSYMPTOM\nFirmware that is not at the latest level can cause several problems: \n\n * Some Integration Blade XI50B appliances cannot maintain the correct power on or off state. \n * Some appliances cannot boot into Dynamic System Analysis (DSA). \n * When you press function key 2 (F2) at boot splash, the appliance hangs.\n\n\nENVIRONMENT\nThe following table shows the current versions of the Integration Blade XI50B component firmware and the upgrade versions. \n\n \n\nComponent Current firmware version Upgrade firmware version UEFI FSE147AUS-1.00 P9E158A-1.19 IMM YUOO72F (1.13) YUOOE9E-1.37 DSA DSYT55B DSYTA7I-9.27 \nThese instructions use the existing DataPower firmware upgrade infrastructure. \n\nThe following files are required for this upgrade:  * reltool_eswUpdater_dsa_dsyta7i-9.27_backup_xi.scrypt2 \n * reltool_eswUpdater_dsa_dsyta7i-9.27_primary_xi.scrypt2 \n * reltool_eswUpdater_imm_yuooe9e-1.37_backup_xi.scrypt2 \n * reltool_eswUpdater_imm_yuooe9e-1.37_primary_xi.scrypt2 \n * reltool_eswUpdater_uefi_p9e158a-1.19_both_xi.scrypt2\n\n\nThese files contain IMM, UEFI, and DSA upgrade packages only. You can use the boot image command or the WebGUI to start the upgrade for the component firmware. All messages are written to the system log. \n\nThe DataPower appliance uses the scrypt2 file format to distribute both firmware upgrades and tools. For tools, always use the boot image command. If you use other commands (such as reinitialize or boot reflash), the appliance might log confusing error messages or not restart automatically as required. \n\nThe tool for component upgrades can run only in appliance firmware versions 5.0.0 and 6.0.0. \n\nIn addition to enabling local upgrades, these tools correct the issues in the Symptoms section:  * Corrects a problem that can occur at boot time when you press the function key 2 <PF2> to load the diagnostics (DSA). \n * Prevents some blades from issuing incorrect reports of \"voltage under threshold\" errors on the expansion module. \n * Prevents some blades from failing to stay powered-down when you request a power-down.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nPrepare the system \n\n *  Download the tools for Fix Central.  * To download directly, click Tools-XI50B-June-2013-Component-Firmware [http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/downloadFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/WebSphere+DataPower+SOA+Appliances&release=6.0.0&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=Tools-XI50B-June-2013-Component-Firmware&includeRequisites=0&includeSupersedes=0&downloadMethod=ddp] \n    * To download manually, go to the Fix Central [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/].

In the search field, enter Network. \n    2. From the search results, click Network Settings. \n    3. Set Relaxed Interface Isolation and Never Enforce Interface Isolation to On. \n    4. Click Apply.\n   \n   Confirm that the Integration Blade XI50B is running. Check for any administrative preconditions for an upgrade; such as, disabling certain network settings for time outs. \n * \n * \n\n\nUpgrade procedure  * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Step 1\n * \n * reltool_eswUpdater_imm_yuooe9e-1.37_primary_xi.scrypt2\n * \n * \n * \n * Step 2\n * \n * reltool_eswUpdater_imm_yuooe9e-1.37_backup_xi.scrypt2\n * \n * \n * \n * Step 3\n * \n * reltool_eswUpdater_uefi_p9e158a-1.19_both_xi.scrypt2\n * \n * \n * \n *  \n   ATTENTION: There is a potential security exposure when the UEFI upgrade begins. An attacker might modify key components on the Integration Blade XI50B. When you perform the upgrade, ensure that the blade is sufficiently isolated from potential attack. Restart the blade as soon as possible after each upgrade. The security exposure ends when the blade restarts. \n * \n * Step 4\n * \n * reltool_eswUpdater_dsa_dsyta7i-9.27_primary_xi.scrypt2\n * \n * \n * \n * Step 5\n * \n * reltool_eswUpdater_dsa_dsyta7i-9.27_backup_xi.scrypt2\n * \n * \n * \n * Step 6\n * \n *  Using the command line, issue the service show component-firmware command. Observe that the IMM and BMC firmware version values correspond to the correct component values for the upgrade. Using the BladeCenter Advanced Management Module (AMM), select the firmware Vital Product Data (VPD) monitor. Check that the firmware BIOS, Blade System Management Processor IMM values, and the Diagnostics pDSA have the correct component values for the upgrade. The Diagnostics version is provided only by the AMM firmware VPD monitor. \n   \n\nConsiderations  * \n * service show component-firmware\n * \n *  The IMM version might not be show the upgrade until the requisite 15-minute wait period is over and the appliance is restarted. The UEFI version does not show the upgrade until the appliance is restarted. No DataPower commands display the DSA information. DSA information can be accessed with the BladeCenter AMM on the Firmware VPD page (the Diagnostics VPD). \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  For the IMM and the DSA, you can perform the upgrade to the primary and backup flash partitions separately.

To avoid such issue, do not use them.\n\nYou can refer to section Reference > Rule languages > ILOG Rule Language (IRL) > IRL grammar > Operator summary [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Global1924.html] of the V7.1 documentation for the full list of supported IRL operators.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nReplace all \"is\" operators by \"==\" operators in the IRL code, rebuild your projects, and redeploy your rulesets and RuleApps. \n\n \n\nThe \"==\" operator works as follows: \n\n * On primitive types, it compares their values. \n * On strings and object references, it compares whether the two instances are the same.\n\n\nTo compare the values of two strings, write in IRL: \n\n * \n * myString.equals(\"test\")\n\n\nIn Business Action Language (BAL), you can still write: \n\n * \n * myString is \"test\"\n\n\nIt will translate to the above IRL code.

IBM Java (SDK / JDK) has been doing leap year testing/verification since 1996, including the non-leap year 2000 without a problem. Basically leap years in Java are explicitly supported by the GregorianCalendar class - that is it's function - and this class is tested with every release of Java as it is part of Java's core functionality. So any Java code which uses the GregorianCalendar class will behave correctly. \n\nWebSphere Application Server performs no specific leap year testing since it runs on top of the SDK which is compliant, and uses function from it. We are not aware of any issues in the past with WebSphere Application Server associated with leap year. \n\nFrom a JDK perspective, Java applications which use the GregorianCalendar class will be leap-year compliant - see the spec at: \n\n(Same info in the links for the various JDK's) \n\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/GregorianCalendar.html [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/GregorianCalendar.html] \n\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/GregorianCalendar.html [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/GregorianCalendar.html]\n\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/GregorianCalendar.html [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/GregorianCalendar.html] \n\n\nSpecifically: \n\n\"The only difference between the Gregorian and the Julian calendar is the leap year rule. The Julian calendar specifies leap years every four years, whereas the Gregorian calendar omits century years which are not divisible by 400.\" In other words the Gregorian Calendar follows modern leap years. The correct operation of the class is tested by the Java Compliance Kit (JCK) which is run against every release of the JVM. So Java applications would need to assert that they are using GregorianCalendars to claim leap-year compliance.", "document_id": "swg21578744", "all_doc_ids": ["swg21976215", "swg21578744", "swg21994264", "isg3T1024480", "swg21697119", "swg21098816", "swg21961159", "swg21960881", "swg1IO03413", "swg21995063", "swg21977902", "swg21983036", "swg21972659", "swg1IZ17762", "swg21982963", "swg21902261", "swg1IT01431", "swg21993946", "swg1PQ14202", "swg21971657", "swg1JR46686", "swg22001664", "swg21976442", "swg1PM04539", "swg27019091", "swg21971284", "swg1IR39907", "swg21966885", "swg1IR44521", "swg21974365", "swg1PK77994", "swg21976680", "swg27019093", "swg21695927", "swg1JR43459", "swg21883667", "swg21687586", "swg21679610", "swg21696762", "swg21692398", "swg1IT14924", "swg21701338", "swg21961171", "swg1PQ31425", "swg21657970", "swg1PQ31177", "swg22005297", "swg21670533", "swg27019121", "swg21962716"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "After applying update to AIX to bring it up to 7100-05-01-1731 which includes RSCT 3.2.3.0 I noticed that neither IBM.GblResRM nor IBM.RecoveryRM would stay operative in \"lssrc -g rsct_rm\" output.

This technote will provide the generic steps to do this for a TSAMP domain and also give steps that allow for resetting the RSCT daemons while the domain is offline. \n\nCAUSE\nSome of the reasons why this procedure might be used: \n\n * Multiple or unknown daemons are hanging and need to be reset \n * TSAMP is in a \"confused\" state and a reset of the automation level is needed \n * Apply a TSAMP/RSCT hotfix/fixpack while leaving the application online \n * Stopping TSAMP/RSCT from taking any actions at all for maintenance reasons\n\nANSWER\nThis procedure is written to be generic and will require modifications for use in a real environment. \n\nOptional steps are prefaced with \"Optional\" in the step description. \n\nAll steps should be run as \"root\" without exception. \n\n \n\n1. Set the cluster scope (any node) \n\nexport CT_MANAGEMENT_SCOPE=2 \n\nThis must be set prior to running cluster commands. If you switch to another user, open a new shell or reload your environment in any way you must re-export this environmental variable. \n\n \n\n2. Optional - Enable manual mode (any node) \n\nsamctrl -M T \n\nThis will stop TSAMP from taking any action during the domain stop and startup. This setting/mode has no effect on RSCT or its operations. While manual mode is enabled (verify with lssam or lssamctrl) TSAMP will not stop nor start any resources so manual control of the highly available application is required. \n\n \n\n3. Change Critical Resource Protection (any node) \n\nchrsrc -c IBM.PeerNode CritRsrcProtMethod=5 \n\nWhen force stopping the domain the core RSCT daemons might exit abnormally, with the default setting of CritRsrcProtMethod this will lead to a kernel panic and reboot. Setting this variable to 5 prevents the kernel panic and reboot. \n\nVerify the change with \n\nlsrsrc -c IBM.PeerNode \n\n \n\n4. Force stop the domain (any node, check on all nodes) \n\nstoprpdomain -f <domain_name> \n\nThis will force stop the domain. Check all nodes in the domain to ensure that the domain has stopped on all nodes, use the following command on each node to verify that the domain shows offline: \n\nlsrpdomain \n\n \n\n5. Optional - Reset RSCT daemons (run on all nodes)\n/usr/sbin/rsct/bin/rmcctrl -z\n/usr/sbin/rsct/bin/rmcctrl -A\n/usr/sbin/rsct/bin/rmcctrl -p\n\nThese commands will stop and start the core RSCT daemons. For more information see the man page for rmcctrl. These commands must be performed on all nodes in the cluster to ensure that the problematic daemon is reset.\n\n\n6. Start the domain (any node)\nstartrpdomain <domain_name>\n\nOnce this command is issued monitor the output of lsrpdomain to see when the domain shows Online. When it shows Online from the node where startrpdomain was issued check the output of lsrpnode to ensure that all nodes also show online.\n\n7. Check lssam for problems (any node)\nlssam\nVerify that all resources appear as they were or that they are showing up properly (this depends on the reason why you are performing this procedure).\n\n\n8. Optional - Disable manual mode (any node)\nsamctrl -M F\nVerify with lssam or lssamctrl that manual mode is no longer enabled.\n\n\n9.

If you are not sure whether you are in fact using Call Home in this manner, please log into your Netezza host (as user \"nz\") and issue the following command: \n\n * nzcallhome -status\n\n\nIf Call Home is configured, you should see a response which includes these lines \n\n[nz@NZ80533-H1 ~]$ nzcallhome -status \nNzCallHome: operational state is 'enabled' \nNzCallHome: PMR generation enabled \nNzCallHome: All rules are configured and enabled \n[nz@NZ80533-H1 ~]$ \n\nNote: there may be additional lines of text in the response \n\nWhich servers are changing? \nThe following table lists the available IBM Support servers and their IP addresses. Make sure that your Netezza\u00ae appliance can send outgoing messages via port 443 to any of these addresses. It is recommended that you open the 129.42.0.0/18 subnet for the most flexibility if your IT security policies permit that. This would allow your appliance to access the IP range 129.42.0.0-129.42.63.255. This will cover all but three off the below addresses. \n\nIf you need to specify individual addresses, please ensure all addresses in bold text are defined to your firewall configurations for these servers. Please also ensure the addresses in underlined text are removed from your firewall configurations. \n *  Host name IP address [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21697812&amp;aid=1] eccgw01.boulder.ibm.com 207.25.252.197 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21697812&amp;aid=1] eccgw02.rochester.ibm.com 129.42.160.51 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21697812&amp;aid=1] www-945.ibm.com 129.42.26.224\n   129.42.42.224 \n   129.42.50.224 \n   129.42.34.224 \n   \n   <== recently added\n   <== please remove www.ecurep.ibm.com [www.ecurep.ibm.com] 192.109.81.20 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21697812&amp;aid=1] www-03.ibm.com 204.146.30.17 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21697812&amp;aid=1] www.ibm.com [www.ibm.com] 129.42.56.216\n   129.42.58.216\n   129.42.60.216 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21697812&amp;aid=1] esupport.ibm.com 129.42.56.189 \n   129.42.60.189 \n   129.42.54.189\n   129.42.58.189 \n   \n   <== recently added\n   <== please remove \n\n\nWhy is this change required? \nIf customer firewalls are not allowing access to the new IPs, problem reporting requests will fail when the DNS resolves to the new node. \n\nWhat error will be returned? \nThe error returned to the Call Home logs /nz/kit/log/nzCallHome/nzCallHome.0.log may vary, but it will likely resemble this: \n\nWSWS3713E: Connection to the remote host www-945.ibm.com:443 failed. \n\nWhen will this change happen? \nTarget deployment is June 2015.

Send the session.ixc file to support for repair\n\nFrom the module directory listed in the error message provide support the file session.ixc\nChoosing to have support repair the session index file requires you to have all users log out \nand shut down the DOORS database server until the repaired file is returned and inserted \nto replace the existing data file for the module.\n\nCreate a replacement session file \nFrom the module directory listed in the error message provide support the file session.ixc\nAdjacent session files will be required in order to to create the replacement. \nYour support engineer will identify these files from the session index file.\nNo work can be performed in the effected module until the replacement session file is restored\nfor the effected module.  \n\n\nNote: Generally the repair is only required for one user session file.

But same was not getting accepted and throwing the same password change page \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nProblem :: In the case of user's intranet password expired hitting home mail server & non-home Mail server url, he is able to change password . However after password change screen its not getting redirected to his mail file and continuously showing the password change screen. \nTo resolve the issue please make sure we have the below settings,\n1> Server doc -> Internet protocol -> Domino web engine ->Memory caches-> Cached user expiration interval. Please make sure this is not set to 0\n\n2> By default, 64 user credentials are kept in the user cache - \"Server doc ->Internet Protocols -> Domino Web engine -> Memory Cache -> Maximum cached users\" field.\n\nWhen the cache is full ie., 64 users are already authenticated with the server and their session is still within the expiration interval, a 65th user needs a Password change, 65 th user would see this issue as he's not in the user cache.\n\nTo resolve the issue, set the Max cached user count to a higher value -say maximum number of web users on this server + ~50 (some overhead) -\nPlease also be aware of the cache expiration interval. Be sure to ensure the settings are consistent among all the participating servers in the SSO.\nThe user whose password needs changed has to be in the user cache for the reasons below :\n\nSince the the ?Change Password is an AdminP request, in a large domain it'd take a while for the adminP to get around to process it and have\nthe person doc changes replicated across all the address books in the domain.

The associated transaction times out. OutOfMemory exceptions can also occur due to Java\u2122 heap exhaustion or fragmentation. Processing OutOfMemory situations can trigger garbage collection (GC) spinning and cause high CPU use.\n\n\nBusiness objects that are 5 MB or larger can be considered \u201clarge\u201d and might require attention (refer to the documents listed in the \"Answer\" section).\n\nNote: OutOfMemory exceptions and high CPU use do not necessarily occur when large Java heaps are used. \n\nThe Recovery MDB eventually completes its cycle, but it takes a long time. The following message is logged when the thread completes execution; it indicates the approximate time for thread completion:\n\nThreadMonitor W WSVR0606W: Thread \"Default : 6\" (00000050) was previously reported to be hung but has completed. It was active for approximately 7759888 milliseconds.

One option is for file uploads and other option is for file downloads. \n * A server-side configuration option is introduced, which allows you to specify an optional white-list of MIME types. MIME types that are included in the list are allowed for uploads, but all other MIME types are blocked from uploads. \n * A server-side configuration option is introduced, which allows you to specify an optional black-list of MIME type mappings. Each MIME type mapping allows for a conversion to be made from a specific MIME type to a specific MIME type upon download.\n\n\nThe following example is a sample configuration of new options, which you can configure in the 100Custom.xml file: \n\n<server> \n<!-- mime type white list which specifies mime types accepted for --> \n<!-- upload to document list or document attachment --> \n<document-attachment-accepted-mime-types> \n<!-- specifies whether to allow a null mime type for upload --> \n<allow-null-mime-type>false</allow-null-mime-type> \n<!-- lists the mime types allowed for upload --> \n<mime-type>text/plain</mime-type> \n<mime-type>img/png</mime-type> \n</document-attachment-accepted-mime-types> \n\n<!-- mime type black list which specifies mappings from unacceptable --> \n<!-- mime types to acceptable mime types for download from --> \n<!-- document list or document attachment --> \n<document-attachment-download-mime-types> \n<!-- will map text/html mime type to text/plain mime type --> \n<mime-type-map> \n<from>text/html</from> \n<to>text/plain</to> \n</mime-type-map> \n<!-- missing <to> element implies mapping to content/octet-stream --> \n<mime-type-map> \n<from>application/pdf</from> \n</mime-type-map> \n</document-attachment-download-mime-types> \n</server> \n\nNote: The default configuration, which does not include the configuration information that is provided in the 100Custom.xml file, acts as a blacklist for the text/html MIME type and maps it to the text/plain MIME type. Providing a configuration in the 100Custom.xml file overrides the default configuration. As a result, for text/html to remain on the blacklist, it should be explicitly added to the 100Custom.xml file.

Eclipse changed the window system requirement from motif to gtk on UNIX operating systems. For AIX, this Eclipse window system change requires the gtk libraries to be installed to support the GUI. For Installation Manager, the GUI is the wizard mode of operation. \n\nYou can use Installation Manager without the gtk libraries. For information on console mode, command-line mode, or silent mode; see the Installation Manager Information Center [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1r6/topic/com.ibm.cic.agent.ui.doc/topics/c_modes.html]. Silent mode uses a response file and command-line mode is supported by all packages. For console mode, check your product documentation to verify that the product supports console mode.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nTo use the GUI, the gtk+ RPM and dependencies must be available on AIX. \n\n\nInstall this set of RPMs on AIX:\n\n\natk-1.12.3-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\ncairo-1.8.8-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nexpat-2.0.1-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nfontconfig-2.4.2-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nfreetype2-2.3.9-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\ngettext-0.10.40-6.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\nglib2-2.12.4-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\ngtk2-2.10.6-4.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nlibjpeg-6b-6.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\nlibpng-1.2.32-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nlibtiff-3.8.2-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\npango-1.14.5-4.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\npixman-0.12.0-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nxcursor-1.1.7-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nxft-2.1.6-5.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\nxrender-0.9.1-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nzlib-1.2.3-3.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\n\nThe installed RPMs must be of the minimum versions listed above.\n\nTo install the RPM versions specified above take the following steps: \n\n\n 1. Download the gtk2_bundle_v2.tar package [ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/aix/freeSoftware/aixtoolbox/ezinstall/ppc/] (version 'v2') containing all the RPMs and the install script to a new directory. \n    \n    \n 2. Decompress the tar file. \n    You can use the command tar -xvf gtk2_bundle_<version>.tar to decompress the file.\n    \n    \n 3. Open the decompressed directory gtk2_bundle_<version> and run the install.sh script.\n    \n    The script will check if the required RPMs are installed at the compatible level. If they are not, the script will prompt to install the compatible versions.\n    \n    \n 4. Verify the environment variable LIBPATH contains a path to the installed libraries. \n    For example LIBPATH=/opt/freeware/lib/\n\n\nNote that if you download and install RPMs individually, we have found that the following libraries are incompatible:  * glib2-2.14.6-2 and gtk2-2.10.6-5 \n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n#Unreadable characters in the GUI when using X11 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21661861]", "document_id": "swg21631478", "all_doc_ids": ["swg24038054", "swg27043142", "swg21661861", "swg21469762", "swg21599089", "swg21498661", "swg1IC99197", "swg1IC95881", "swg21455149", "swg1IZ70296", "swg1PM69663", "swg1IT11617", "swg21683244", "swg1PI29110", "swg21631478", "swg21967264", "swg21469033", "swg27027178", "swg21622513", "swg27036212", "swg21957879", "swg21438776", "nas8N1012223", "swg22010179", "swg21375571", "swg21389888", "swg24042656", "swg22004059", "swg24041283", "swg1IV97558", "swg27042323", "swg21380745", "swg21366385", "swg24043360", "swg24043836", "swg24039346", "swg21985946", "swg1IV98062", "swg21694105", "swg27018338", "swg24039838", "swg21681385", "swg21428366", "swg21883385", "swg1IT17288", "swg21574804", "swg27018339", "swg27018353", "swg21446020", "swg24041385"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Why WebSphere Application Server transactions are rolled back with these StaleConnectionExceptions?\nMy transactions are rolled back and the following errors are seen in the WebSphere Application Server logs:\n\nConnectionEve A J2CA0056I: ........ ........

IBM ODM for z/OS V8.5.1 planned availability date will be on 13 December 2013. This document contains a brief overview of IBM ODM for z/OS V8.5.1 and a link to the announcement letter.\n\n\nCONTENT\nOverview:\n\n\nThe offering provides end-to-end, lifecycle support for business decisions invoked from Java , COBOL, and PL/I applications. This includes capabilities for decision testing and simulation within either the Rule Execution Server (RES) in the WebSphere\u00ae Application Server for z/OS or the zRule Execution Server (zRES) for z/OS environments, as well as the ability to trace the execution of how a business decision is made in the zRule Execution Server using the Decision Warehouse feature. \n\nIBM ODM for z/OS provides multiple, business-rule execution choices for z/OS customers who have Java , Enterprise COBOL, and PL/I applications, running as Batch, IMS\u2122 Batch, IMS Message Processing Programs or hosted within CICS\u00ae V4.2 or CICS V5.1 regions. \n\nIBM ODM for z/OS , V8.5.1 is designed to provide a smoother transition than the tool used in previous releases, whether it is reusing rules across applications, operating in different language environments, expanding decision management into PL/I applications, or even moving from version to version. Also new with Version 8.5.1 is the ability to keep track of how the software is being used, on a decision basis. \n\nIBM ODM for z/OS and IBM Business Rules for z/OS , available as a separate product, help enable organizations in virtually every industry to improve the quality of transaction, batch, and process-related decisions that are made repeatedly within mainframe applications and to determine the appropriate courses of action for customers, partners, and internal interactions by: \n\n * Automating and governing operational decision making across business processes and applications to help improve business outcomes. \n * Helping detect opportunities and risks in real time \n * Easily and consistently implementing changes to help meet new market demands or policy requirements. \n * Supporting incremental modernization of existing CICS , IMS , and batch applications written in Java , COBOL, or PL/I without a complete re-write. \n * Facilitating consistent decision evaluation across platforms, projects, and processes by allowing the reuse of business models between rule projects in z/OS and distributed applications. \n * Detecting events and event patterns in real time to enable situational awareness and response of actionable situations. \n * Automating the response of highly variable decisions based on the specific context of a process, transaction, or interaction. \n * Managing and governing rules-based decision logic separately from application code in order to provide better visibility, understanding, and maintainability compared to traditional application development. \n * Providing visibility to business users on how business decisions are made. \n * Integrating with a number of other z/OS technologies to create comprehensive decision management solutions written in Java , COBOL, or PL/I, using CICS , IMS , or z/OS batch execution environments. \n   \n\n\nFor more details, see the US Announcement Letter for IBM Operational Decision Manager for z/OS V8.5.1 [http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/8/897/ENUS213-408/index.html&lang=en&request_locale=en] \nInformation for other country announcement letters is located here [http://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/index.wss]. \n\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration WebSphere ILOG Decision Validation Services General AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, Windows, z/OS Enterprise Business Integration WebSphere ILOG Rule Solutions for Office General Windows All Editions Business Integration WebSphere ILOG Rule Team Server AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, Windows, z/OS Enterprise Business Integration WebSphere Business Events AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, Windows All Editions Business Integration WebSphere ILOG JRules Platform Independent Enterprise \nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n ODM", "document_id": "swg21651648", "all_doc_ids": ["swg27023725", "swg21588859", "swg21589902", "swg21441394", "swg21440249", "swg21590333", "swg21627010", "swg21587817", "swg21586717", "swg21589514", "swg21584855", "swg21426871", "swg21495819", "swg21425487", "swg24029716", "swg21677736", "swg24033604", "swg24030832", "swg21427125", "swg21578192", "swg21678239", "swg21635533", "swg21430461", "swg21589513", "swg1RS00212", "swg1PI98282", "swg21652005", "swg21651648", "swg21615508", "swg21579231", "swg21679679", "swg1RS02323", "swg1RS02562", "swg21642741", "swg21420910", "swg21452630", "swg21587674", "swg21495979", "swg21449660", "swg24029802", "swg24026623", "swg24030829", "swg24043197", "swg21585677", "swg1RS01803", "swg21400593", "swg24043046", "swg24042898", "swg21502095", "swg24043308"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "While attempting to upgrade Portal to CF14 the upgrade fails during the import-nodes sub-task.\n\nThe ConfigTrace.log shows the following...\n\nimport-nodes:\n\n--- Exception Thrown --- C:\\Portal8\\PortalServer\\jcr\\wp.content.repository.install\\config\\include s\\jcr.install_cfg.xml:826: com.ibm.icm.jcr.task.TaskException: TASK001X: Remote task execution failed with response code 404 due to exception : Not Found .

Unix error code 24.\n\nNew sockets/file descriptors can not be opened after the limit has been reached. \n\n\nCAUSE\nSystem configuration limitation.\n\nWhen the \"Too Many Open Files\" error message is written to the logs, it indicates that all available file handles for the process have been used (this includes sockets as well). In a majority of cases, this is the result of file handles being leaked by some part of the application. This technote explains how to collect output that identifies what file handles are in use at the time of the error condition.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n\n\n\n\nDetermine Ulimits\n\nOn UNIX and Linux operating systems, the ulimit for the number of file handles can be configured, and it is usually set too low by default. Increasing this ulimit to 8000 is usually sufficient for normal runtime, but this depends on your applications and your file/socket usage. Additionally, file descriptor leaks can still occur even with a high value. \n\nDisplay the current soft limit:\nulimit -Sn\n\nDisplay the current hard limit:\nulimit -Hn\n\nOr capture a Javacore, the limit will be listed in that file under the name NOFILE:\nkill -3 PID\n\n\nPlease see the following document if you would like more information on where you can edit ulimits:\nGuidelines for setting ulimits (WebSphere Application Server)\nhttp://www.IBM.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21469413 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21469413]\n\n\nOperating Systems \n\nWindows By default, Windows does not ship with a tool to debug this type of problem. Instead Microsoft provides a tool that you can download called Process Explorer [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653]. This tool identifies the open handles/files associated with the Java\u2122 process (but usually not sockets opened by the Winsock component) and determines which handles are still opened. These handles result in the \"Too many open files\" error message. \n\nTo display the handles, click on the Gear Icon [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&amp;aid=1] in the toolbar (or press CTRL+ H to toggle the handles view). The icon will change to the icon for DLL files (so you can toggle it back to the DLL view). \n\nIt is important that you change the Refresh Rate. Select View > Update Speed, and change it to 5 seconds. \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&aid=2] \n\nThere is also another Microsoft utility called Handle that you can download from the following URL: \nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896655.aspx [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896655.aspx] \n\nThis tool is a command line version of Process Explorer. The URL above contains the usage instructions. \n\n\nAIX \nThe commands lsof and procfiles are usually the best commands to determine what files and sockets are opened.. \n\nlsof \nTo determine if the number of open files is growing over a period of time, issue lsof to report the open files against a PID on a periodic basis. For example: \n\nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nThis output does not give the actual file names to which the handles are open. It provides only the name of the file system (directory) in which they are contained. The lsof command indicates if the open file is associated with an open socket or a file. When it references a file, it identifies the file system and the inode, not the file name. \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\nprocfiles \nThe procfiles command does provide similar information, and also displays the full filenames loaded. It may not show sockets in use. \n\nprocfiles -n [PID] > procfiles.out \n\n\nOther commands (to display filenames that are opened) \n\nINODES and DF \ndf -kP filesystem_from_lsof | awk '{print $6}' | tail -1 \n>> Note the filesystem name \nfind filesystem_name -inum inode_from_lsof -print > filelist.out \n>> Shows the actual file name \n\nsvmon \nsvmon -P PID -m | grep pers (for JFS) \nsvmon -P PID -m | grep clnt (for JFS2, NFS) \n(this opens files in the format: filesystem_device:inode) \n\nUse the same procedure as above for finding the actual file name. \n\n\nLinux To determine if the number of open files is growing over a period of time, issue lsof to report the open files against a PID on a periodic basis. For example: \n\nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nThe output will provide you with all of the open files for the specified PID. You will be able to determine which files are opened and which files are growing over time. \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\n\nAlternately you can list the contents of the file descriptors as a list of symbolic links in the following directory, where you replace PID with the process ID. This is especially useful if you don't have access to the lsof command: \n\nls -al /proc/PID/fd \n\n\nSolaris Run the following commands to monitor open file (socket) descriptors on Solaris: \n\npfiles \n/usr/proc/bin/pfiles [ PID ] > pfiles.out \n\nlsof \nlsof -p [ PID ] > lsof.ou t \n\nThis will get one round of lsof output. If you want to determine if the number of open files is growing over time, you can issue the command with the -r option to capture multiple intervals: \nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\nHP-UX \nlsof \nlsof -p [ PID ] > lsof.out \n\nThis will get one round of lsof output. If you want to determine if the number of open files is growing over time, you can issue the command with the -r option to capture multiple intervals: \nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version

"answer_category": null}], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "port porting migrating migration migrate TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How to migrate a non-RRS (non-Datacap Studio) Datacap Taskmaster application. \n\nCAUSE\nDatacap Taskmaster applications typically reference a number of files using either drive-letter or UNC based paths. They access several databases using either system DSN's or ODBC Provider specifications. Finally, they typically access the Taskmaster Server via an IP address or machine name. This document identifies where these file paths, database, and server specifications are stored and how to change them when the application must be moved.\n\nANSWER\nThe three main shared folders used by Datacap Taskmaster applications: \n\nDatacap Taskmaster software is typically installed on a shared network drive, although it can also be installed locally on each station. In a network installation, the software folder is usually named \\Datacap.\n\nApplication-specific files usually reside in a folder inside the Datacap folder. By convention the Application Process folder (and sub-folders) contains all application-specific files such as Access databases (*.mdb), Batch Pilot projects (*.bpp), custom forms and scripts (*.dcf. *.dcs, *.rra), etc.\nBatches of documents, containing images and data, are usually stored in a shared folder on the network. Sometimes the Batch folder is within the Application folder, but typically it is separate.\n\nWhere file paths, database identifiers, and server IP addresses are stored: \n\n * The Windows registry contains paths to the Datacap folder for registered software components, and may also contain non-critical paths such as recently used files, etc. \n * Desktop, Start Menu, and Windows Scheduler shortcuts to Taskmaster Client, Rule Manager, AutoDelete, ENU, etc. frequently contain paths to the software, configuration settings (.ini) files, and either DSN's or ODBC Provider strings to databases. Services may also contain paths (e.g. to TMSub, the Taskmaster Client Service). \n * The Taskmaster Admin database contains paths in dco table, dco_setup field and taskmod table, md_params field (Document Hierarchy file and task-specific setup parameters, respectively). \n * The Taskmaster Engine database contains paths in the tmbatch table, pb_batchdir field (Batch Directory). \n * Taskmaster Rules databases may contain paths in the action table, ac_Params field (Action parameters); paths are also stored in the Template table, tp_CCOPath and tp_ImagePath fields (fingerprint files and associated CCO's). \n * Report Viewer databases contain paths in the Reports table, Crystal and DB fields (report file locations and databases). \n * Batch Pilot and Taskmaster Web project files (*.bpp and *.icp) contain paths to forms, scripts, and possibly other files. \n * Taskmaster Web configuration file Apps.ini contains the IP address of Taskmaster Server, as well as the DSN or ODBC connection string for the Admin and Engine databases for each Taskmaster Web application. \n * Rule Manager settings files (e.g. ruleman.ini) contain paths to the Document Hierarchy (setup dco), Batch Folder, Actions Folder, Rule Runner software, and Fingerprint Folder. \n * AutoDelete\u2019s settings file (e.g. tmbatdel.ini)\n\n\nChanging paths to the application and/or software: \nWhen changing drive letters, UNC paths, or switching between drive letters and UNC, the following procedures are recommended. These actions should be performed when the Datacap Taskmaster system is shut down \u2013 Taskmaster Clients, Web Clients, Web Server, and Taskmaster Server should all be logged out or stopped. The entire Application folder, the Admin and Engine databases should be fully backed up before making these changes. \n\nChanging the shared folder where Datacap Taskmaster software is located:  1. After installing the software in the new location, run the register install from all client stations. \n 2. Make an inventory of Datacap Taskmaster application shortcuts on client desktops, Start menus, and Windows Scheduler. Each one containing a path needs to be updated. (The install\\clfolder.ini can be modified to install new or updated shortcuts automatically when the register install is performed) \n 3. If the application folder is located in the shared Datacap folder, follow the steps below for changing the shared Application folder. \n 4. If Taskmaster Server or Client is installed as a Service, select the Service, choose properties, and update the Path to Executable. \n 5. Report Viewer databases typically need to be updated \u2013 open the Reports table in the rptview.mdb database, and update paths in the Crystal and DB tables. \n 6. Batch Pilot projects (*.bpp) for standard tasks contain paths to the shared Datacap folder. Edit all *.bpp and *.icp files in the Application folder using a text editor. Change all paths as required.\n\n\nChanging the shared folder where Batches are stored:  1. Identify the Batch Creation tasks in the workflows (typically scan, vscan, or fax input tasks). \n 2. For each Batch Creation task, go into Task Setup and change the Batch Directory. For Batch Pilot tasks select File/Task Settings and update the setting titled Create Batch Dir under. \n 3. If in process batches were moved, edit the Engine Database table tmbatch and make replacements to the value in field pb_batchdir for all affected batches. \n 4. If any application-custom tasks or actions contain the path to the batch folder, they should be modified. Application-custom action parameters can be scanned in the Rules database.\n\n\nChanging the shared Application and Application Process folders:  1. Make an inventory of Datacap Taskmaster application shortcuts on client desktops, Start menus, and Windows Scheduler. Each one containing a path needs to be updated. (The install\\clfolder.ini can be modified to install new or updated shortcuts automatically when the register install is performed) \n 2. Most Batch Pilot and Taskmaster Web projects (*.bpp and *.icp) contain paths to the Application and/or Process folder. Edit all *.bpp and *.icp files in the Application folder using a text editor. Change all paths as required. \n 3. Workflow Document Hierarchy files (XML files, also called setup DCO) need to be reset in Taskmaster Administrator for each workflow, and also reselected in each Batch Pilot Task Project that the application uses. \n 4. Some tasks refer to settings files in the Process folder. Go through the settings for each task, checking each option in each tab for paths, and update as needed. \n 5. If the Admin or Engine databases are MS-Access *.mdb files, the DSN will need to be updated in Taskmaster Server. \n 6. If the Rules or Lookup databases are MS-Access *.mdb files, update the DSN's on each server and client that runs rules or performs lookups. \n 7. If the application uses Rules:  1. Edit ruleman.ini (or whatever rules setting file is specified in the Rule Manager shortcut) and change paths as needed. \n     2. Edit the Taskmaster Rules database table action, and change any paths in the ac_Params field as needed. \n     3. In the Taskmaster Rules database table Template, change paths as needed in fields tp_CCOPath and tp_ImagePath.\n    \n    \n 8. If the application uses FormSpecs, edit them in a text editor and search for references to the Process folder. Update the paths as required.\n\n\nChanging Databases: \nUsing DSNs \u2013 inventory the chosen DSN names and then use ODBC manager to: \n1. Update the Datacap Taskmaster application Admin and Engine DSN's on Taskmaster Server. \n2. If the application uses lookups, update the Lookup DSN on all client stations that require it. If TMWeb is used, this includes the Taskmaster Server station. \n3. If the application uses Rules, update the Rules DSN on all client stations that require it. If TMWeb is used, this includes the Taskmaster Server station.", "document_id": "swg21507391", "all_doc_ids": ["swg21996187", "swg21599801", "swg21500328", "swg21973739", "swg1IO24746", "swg21959318", "swg21664386", "swg21996717", "swg21507391", "swg21647109", "swg21507030", "swg1IO24509", "swg21503322", "swg21974023", "swg21968904", "swg27041951", "swg1IO24875", "swg1IO24666", "swg27039743", "swg1IO24447", "swg27049420", "swg1IO24540", "swg21504200", "swg21675631", "swg21665610", "swg21635504", "swg1IO24703", "swg22005513", "swg21968951", "swg1IO24597", "swg1IV34552", "swg21991398", "swg1IO24442", "swg21666402", "swg27047298", "swg1IV99503", "swg21968549", "swg21566941", "swg22015844", "swg27050031", "swg21567483", "swg1IO24495", "swg21636776", "swg1IO23927", "swg1IO24471", "swg1IO24168", "swg1HD68705", "swg1IO24682", "swg21976161", "swg21606570"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "When migrating from Workplace XT to Content Navigator, can I covert or migrate XT created search templates to the ICN version of managed search templates?", "id": "DEV_Q213", "answers": [{"answer_id": 53817697, "document_id": "swg21648471", "question_id": "DEV_Q213", "text": "Workplace XT created search templates are also supported in ICN with the restriction that the search template cannot be edited in ICN.", "answer_start": 510, "answer_end": 644, "answer_category": null}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "stored search; search template; WPXT; Workplace XT; ICN; navigator; IBM Content Navigator TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n Does IBM Content Navigator support Workplace XT created stored searches and search templates? \n\nANSWER\nWorkplace XT created stored searches are supported in IBM Content Navigator (ICN). \nICN can be used to only run these stored searches with the following restriction: \n- stored searches that return both documents and folders are not supported.\nThese stored searches cannot be edited in ICN.\n\nWorkplace XT created search templates are also supported in ICN with the restriction that the search template cannot be edited in ICN.\n\nPlease also note that ICN can only create native search templates, but not stored searches.", "document_id": "swg21648471", "all_doc_ids": ["swg21648471", "swg21631559", "swg21974687", "swg27039472", "swg21964458", "swg27042668", "swg21981174", "swg1PJ37195", "swg27044022", "swg21504453", "swg1PJ39264", "swg1IO18580", "swg1IO19036", "swg1PJ36608", "swg1IO26244", "swg27038765", "swg1PJ36863", "swg21698998", "swg1IO22664", "swg21622439", "swg1IO23939", "swg1PJ36511", "swg27042495", "swg1PJ39345", "swg1PJ39344", "swg27047576", "swg21600778", "swg21884022", "swg1PJ38317", "swg21977898", "swg1IO19783", "swg1IO22899", "swg1IO22362", "swg1PJ38766", "swg1PJ33526", "swg21662803", "swg1PJ37002", "swg21959041", "swg1IO25469", "swg1IO22388", "swg27022200", "swg21579910", "swg22005838", "swg1PJ40540", "swg21654981", "swg1IO17916", "swg21990584", "swg21390471", "swg21627609", "swg1PJ37186"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "My PDWDB does show a huge amount of data residing on the PDWDB table/view for TASKS.

As a starting point, customers should consider looking at the following separate Technotes as starting points: \n\nHow to improve Excel link report speed - Technote 1347497 How to improve consolidation speed - Technote 1371240 \nThis Technote shall concentrate only on the topic of 'Controller Performance vs Database Size'.\n\nGeneral Discussion:\nIn general terms:  * The more complex a financial structure (financial configuration) that the customer uses, the larger their database will be  * For example, the more (optional) dimensions that the customer uses, the larger the database will be \n    * In other words, a system used by a relatively small ($ turnover) company, with only 10 users, could potentially have a much larger database compared to a large ($ turnover) corporation with 100 users. This could be true if the small company had a complex financial structure and wanted to report in minute detail all of its financial details.\n   \n   \n * Naturally, over time the database will grow.  * Specifically, each period (typically a month) will have data stored inside it. Each month the database will grow because that month's financial records will have been stored inside the Controller database. \n    * Specifically, there is an XDB table that corresponds with each year (e.g. XDB14 = 2014). As data is added into the system that year, these tables grow in size.\n   \n   \n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nFAQ: \n\n\nQ1 - How large is my database currently?\n\nAsk your I.T. department's DBA. \n\n * For example, if using Microsoft SQL then inside \"SQL Server Management Studio\" right-click on the database, and choose 'properties':\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21681197&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21681197&aid=1] \n * The 'data' is stored inside the MDF file. This is the amount of space allocated to the Controller data (253Mb in the above example). \n * The SQL 'log' is stored inside the LDF file (1Mb in the above picture). This is used by Microsoft SQL for its backup/recovery functionality. It is not used by Controller.\n\n\nQ2 - What is currently using the biggest amount of space in my database? \n\nBy looking at the sizes of the individual tables (inside the database), it is easy to see where most of the space is being used.  * For instructions, see separate IBM Technote #1345780\n\n\nQ3 - Is there anything 'useless' that I can delete to immediately free up space? \n\nIn many customer's cases, the answer is YES.  * Old/redundant TM1 trickle data can often easily be deleted from XDBTRICKLE. See separate IBM Technote #1624409 for more details. \n * Old Audit log can often easily be deleted from XDBAUDIT. See separate IBM Technote #1696796 for more details. \n * Old/redundant account locking information can often be deleted from XACCLOCK. Please contact IBM Support for more details.\n\n\nQ4 - Can I use SQL tools to shrink the MDF and LDF files (to reduce the hard drive space used) \n\nYes, but be aware that shrinking the database (specifically the MDF) can lead to database fragmentation, which can reduce performance. \n\nIn general terms:  * Shrinking the MDF should only be done after you have made large changes to the system (e.g. reduced XACCLOCK). \n * Shrinking the LDF can safely be done regularly (e.g. after every database full backup). \n * For more details on this topic, see separate IBM Technote #1367388.\n\n\nQ5 - Can I delete some old financial information (e.g. old years that we no longer use) from my Controller database? \n\nYes, it is possible to delete old data (for example all information older than 5 years old) from inside the database.  * Naturally you should create a backup of the database (before the deletion) and retain this (archive it somewhere safe) in case of future need.\n\n\nContact IBM Support for more information on this topic. \nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nQ6 - Will making my Controller database smaller speed up Controller? \n\n\nThere is not a simple answer to this question:\n\nGeneral SQL operations: \n\n * Database backups \n * Database optimisations (especially re-indexes)\n\nIn general, the smaller the database the quicker the SQL server will be able to perform backup and optimisation tasks. For example, when a superuser performs a 'database optimisation' (inside Controller) this will run quicker on a smaller Controller database. \n\nExcel link reports: \nThere is no direct link between a smaller database and faster Excel link performance. Instead, the speed of the Excel link report depends on a huge number of factors.  * Perhaps the most important factor is the spreadsheet/report design. \n * See separate Technote 1347497 for more details.\n\n\nConsolidations: \nThere is no direct link between a smaller database and faster consolidation performance. Instead, the speed of the consolidation depends on a huge number of factors.  * Perhaps the most important factors are the financial complexity and the version of Controller used. \n * See separate Technote 1371240 for more details.\n\n\nOther Controller functions: \nThere is no direct link between a smaller database and the speed of other individual Controller functions (for example the speed of opening/changing the account structure). Instead, the speed of other individual Controller functions depend on a huge number of factors.  * Perhaps the most important factors are the financial complexity and the version of Controller used.\n\n\nAs an overall comment, it is recommended that a customer:  * Creates a copy of their production database \n * Connects Controller to this new copy, and takes measurements for the speed/performance of their current database \n * Makes changes (for example deletes old data, and/or reduces the dimensions/complexity of their financial configuration). \n * Afterwards, re-take measurements for the speed/performance of their changes/reduced database.\n\nBy doing this, the customer can find the direct effect of these changes to their system (before they perform those changes in the real 'production' database).

SLM is not CPU intensive and does not require large amounts of data transfer. It simply needs to be available all the time for license verification. \n\nHistorically the scenario has gone something like:\n\nYou have deployed Modeler 16.0 FP1 with Concurrent user\nlicensing. You have internal and external clients trying to\naccess a license token from this license manager. The external\nclients consistently cannot receive a license, though it seems\nclear their initial communication has succeeded and a license\ntoken actually has been checked out.\n\nThe problem may be the MTU setting on your VPN. Safenet\nSentinel RMS License Manager does two things with the client/LM\ncommunication:\n1) It pads the packets of its response to the client to 1460 bytes\n2) It sets a \"Do not Fragment\" bit.\n\nSo if your MTU setting is less than 1460 bytes, your VPN will\nwant to fragment the packet, but the \"Do not fragment\" bit is\nset and so it can't. The net effect is that the request for a\ntoken comes in, the LM responds, but neither the LM response to\nclient nor the client acknowledgement it has the token gets back\nto the involved parties. After 300 seconds, both give up -- the\nLM thinking the client is no longer on the network, and the\nclient thinking the LM doesn't exist.\n\nAn Enhancement Request has been submitted to SafeNet to address\nthis issue (our ECM00206067).\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Need more help?

Such attribute is used by JCR when querying for theme policy information.\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nCollect the following: \n\n * LDIF export of a sample user that hits this problem (if the backend user registry is LDAP)  * If you cannot determine a specific user causing the error, you can use the following tracestring to confirm:\n   \n   *=info:com.ibm.wps.policy.services.*=finest:com.ibm.wps.policy.commands.*=finest\n   \n   Then look for the following line in trace.log: com.ibm.wps.policy.services.PolicyService PolicyService() ENTRY userid contructor: {DN of user} \n   \n   \n * Resources.xml - can be found under  * <wp_profile>/config/cells/<cellname>/clusters/<clustername>/ for cluster \n    * <wp_profile>/config/cells/<cellname>/nodes/<nodename>/servers/<portalservername>/ for standalone\n   \n   \n\nLocate the WP PumaStoreService Resource Environment Provider in resources.xml and confirm if there is a defined property name for store.puma_default.user.fbadefault.filter. If not, then the default and active value for such property is \"uid\". If it does exist, then verify the attribute defined for the value. Then check the LDIF export for the user to confirm if such attribute is defined. \nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nCreate/update the store.puma_default.user.fbadefault.filter custom property for the WP PumaStoreService Resource Environment Provider via the Integrated Solutions Console to an attribute that exists for all Portal users in the backend user registry (for example, \"cn\").\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n#Puma Store Service [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Puma_Store_Service_wp8]\nSetting service configuration properties [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Setting_service_configuration_properties_wp8?OpenDocument&sa=true]", "document_id": "swg21664629", "all_doc_ids": ["swg21691676", "swg21664629", "swg21605332", "swg1PK74589", "swg21698162", "swg21670791", "swg21614990", "swg21608902", "swg21676851", "swg1JR58837", "swg21590077", "swg1PM69487", "swg21616175", "swg1JR42387", "swg21378393", "swg21573746", "swg1PJ33201", "swg1PJ33194", "swg21606528", "swg1LO31720", "swg1PM09199", "swg1LO46238", "swg21624168", "swg21610720", "swg1PI30765", "swg1IV60077", "swg1PM98562", "swg1IC80753", "swg1PM26528", "swg22005356", "swg24039368", "swg21645066", "swg22002964", "swg21679878", "swg21993420", "swg21993737", "swg21460933", "swg21645251", "swg21638105", "swg1PK64061", "swg21693563", "swg1PI24506", "swg21307233", "swg21686773", "swg21672837", "swg1PI73425", "swg21293752", "swg21324111", "swg1PM01634", "swg27019083"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Just a simple question:How to check IBM Java ORB build version in WebSphere Application Server?", "id": "DEV_Q226", "answers": [{"answer_id": 64407938, "document_id": "swg1IV47424", "question_id": "DEV_Q226", "text": "", "answer_start": -1, "answer_end": 0, "answer_category": null}], "is_impossible": true}], "context": " SUBSCRIBE\nYou can track all active APARs for this component.\n\n\n\nAPAR STATUS\n * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.\n    \n   \n   \n\nERROR DESCRIPTION\n *  Error Message: N/A\n   .\n   Stack Trace: N/A\n   .\n   First seen from build  after Java 1.5 SR16\n   Build DATE - 20130521_01\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nLOCAL FIX\n\nPROBLEM SUMMARY\n *  Added System.getProperty in constructor call of\n   org.omg.CORBA_2_3.portable.OutputStream\n   The exorbitant call is causing this performance degradation.\n   WebSphere tests has found degradation of throughput by 9%.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\n *  This defect will be fixed in:\n   5.0.0 SR16 FP4\n   .\n   Call this property initially  and based on it set\n   a private static final boolean variable.\n   Use a check of that boolean variable on the constructor.\n   There are performance changes which is causing current ( fixed)\n   626SR6 orb performing better than 626SR5 ORB.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nTEMPORARY FIX\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nAPAR INFORMATION\n * APAR NUMBER\n   IV47424\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT NAME\n   JAVA 5 ORB\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT ID\n   620500123\n   \n   \n * REPORTED RELEASE\n   500\n   \n   \n * STATUS\n   CLOSED PER\n   \n   \n * PE\n   NoPE\n   \n   \n * HIPER\n   NoHIPER\n   \n   \n * SPECIAL ATTENTION\n   NoSpecatt\n   \n   \n * SUBMITTED DATE\n   2013-08-22\n   \n   \n * CLOSED DATE\n   2013-08-28\n   \n   \n * LAST MODIFIED DATE\n   2013-08-28\n   \n   \n\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED FROM ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n * APAR IS SYSROUTED TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n\nFIX INFORMATION\n * FIXED COMPONENT NAME\n   JAVA 5 ORB\n   \n   \n * FIXED COMPONENT ID\n   620500123\n   \n   \n\nAPPLICABLE COMPONENT LEVELS\n * R500 PSY\n   UP", "document_id": "swg1IV47424", "all_doc_ids": ["swg1PI76313", "swg1PK96640", "swg24013680", "swg24026894", "swg21138435", "swg21245077", "swg1PM48509", "swg21199556", "swg1JR41008", "swg1PI22134", "swg1PK20471", "swg1PK65397", "swg21052165", "swg21465919", "swg21255218", "swg21403873", "swg21174604", "swg21301369", "swg1PK32985", "swg1PK45120", "swg1PK37506", "swg1PK29674", "swg21457001", "swg1PM39777", "swg21224719", "swg1PM39629", "swg1IX90121", "swg1PK85674", "swg1PK32522", "swg1PK29675", "swg1PQ91038", "swg1IV47424", "swg24004407", "swg1PQ94171", "swg1PQ94172", "swg1PK47437", "swg1PM60005", "swg21168565", "swg1IY86556", "swg1PK58245", "swg1PM20587", "swg21696670", "swg27043836", "swg21456801", "swg1PK68853", "swg1PK83488", "swg21213921", "swg1PM60417", "swg21412622", "swg21330078"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What versions of BPM support Java 7?", "id": "DEV_Q227", "answers": [{"answer_id": 49179752, "document_id": "swg1JR58297", "question_id": "DEV_Q227", "text": "", "answer_start": -1, "answer_end": 0, "answer_category": null}], "is_impossible": true}], "context": " SUBSCRIBE TO THIS APAR\nBy subscribing, you receive periodic emails alerting you to the status of the APAR, along with a link to the fix after it becomes available.

from \"password\" to one that had an\n   ampersand (&), e.g. \"bad&pass\".  When they attempted to start\n   up the engine, they got\n   Startup did not succeed. Terminating:\n   com.sterlingcommerce.hadrian.common.xml.XmlParsingException:\n   Error on line 10: The reference to entity \"pass\" must end\n   with the ';' delimiter.\n   The Customer had to reinstall the engine and refrain from using\n   a keystore passphrase that included an ampersand.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nLOCAL FIX\n\nPROBLEM SUMMARY\n *  The SSP engine or CM may not start correctly after using\n   configureEngineSsl.bat/bin or configureCmSsl.bat/bin to change\n   the keystore password to a string containing special\n   characters. Depending on the location of the special character\n   in the string, the error message will be something like:\n   Startup did not succeed. Terminating:\n   com.sterlingcommerce.hadrian.common.xml.XmlParsingException:\n   Error on line 10: The reference to entity \"pass\" must end with\n   the ';' delimiter.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\n *  Code has been added to correctly encapsulate passwords so that\n   special characters are not processed as such.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nTEMPORARY FIX\n *  Sent Customer fix for RTC453348.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nCOMMENTS\n\nAPAR INFORMATION\n * APAR NUMBER\n   IT06749\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT NAME\n   STR SECURE PROX\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT ID\n   5725D0300\n   \n   \n * REPORTED RELEASE\n   342\n   \n   \n * STATUS\n   CLOSED PER\n   \n   \n * PE\n   NoPE\n   \n   \n * HIPER\n   NoHIPER\n   \n   \n * SPECIAL ATTENTION\n   NoSpecatt / Xsystem\n   \n   \n * SUBMITTED DATE\n   2015-01-26\n   \n   \n * CLOSED DATE\n   2015-03-18\n   \n   \n * LAST MODIFIED DATE\n   2015-03-18\n   \n   \n\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED FROM ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n * APAR IS SYSROUTED TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n\nFIX INFORMATION\n * FIXED COMPONENT NAME\n   STR SECURE PROX\n   \n   \n * FIXED COMPONENT ID\n   5725D0300\n   \n   \n\nAPPLICABLE COMPONENT LEVELS\n * R342 PSY\n   UP", "document_id": "swg1IT06749", "all_doc_ids": ["swg1RS02029", "swg21428835", "swg21672988", "swg21527397", "swg1PM48474", "swg1IV46355", "swg21987169", "swg21278789", "swg21438995", "swg1IT23780", "swg21575468", "swg1IZ76279", "swg21662832", "swg22002148", "swg1IZ16728", "swg21341811", "swg1IV33162", "swg1IZ07590", "swg1IT06749", "swg21685029", "swg21673608", "swg21441698", "swg22002587", "swg1PI84763", "swg1IC57900", "swg1PI27490", "swg1PM79930", "swg1JR56970", "swg1IZ30480", "swg1IC88364", "swg1PJ37518", "swg1IC93829", "swg1PM51992", "swg21637141", "swg21519130", "swg1PJ40744", "swg21529225", "swg1IV75109", "swg1IT02283", "swg1PI66809", "swg21677062", "swg1PM57496", "swg1JR36551", "swg1PI16352", "swg21662127", "swg1IT11159", "swg1IC74692", "swg21637708", "swg1PM57659", "swg1JR43049"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Is it possible to disable the left navigation pane menu for certain application?

In most instances, this object is the attribute that was put into the session object; however, sometimes this object is referenced by an attribute of the session object. \n\n To determine which attribute of the session object references this non-serializable object, access the SessionInspectServlet.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nImplement the Java.io.Serializable or Java.io.Externalizable interface\n\nWith persistent sessions enabled, any object that is put into the HTTPSession must implement the serializable interface in order for session manager to store the session data outside of JVM.\n\nWhen PMI is enabled, there is a counter for session data size. In order to evaluate this counter, the session data must be serialized into a byte array stream. Any object that is put into the HTTPSession must implement the serializable interface in order for session manager to convert the session data objects into byte array stream.\n\nFor example:\n\npublic classMyObject implementsSerializable{\n}//end of class MyObject\n\nCheck that all objects placed in the HTTPSession implement the java.io.Serializable or java.io.Externalizable interface.\n\n\n 1. Acess the SessionInspectServlet\n    \n    If the class name printed in the exception is not an object that is explicitly placed into the HTTPSession, use the SessionInspectServlet to determine the attribute in the HTTPSession that references a non-serializable object. \n\n\n\nSessionInspectServlet helps application writers to determine if application is written to support session persistence. SessionInspectServlet helps to: \n\n * Determine attributes present in the session\n   \n * Determine serializable and non-serializable attributes in the session\n   \n * Determine the size of each serializable attribute in session\n   \n * Determine if serializable attribute is implemented properly (if serializable attribute and all its internals are serializable)\n\n\nServlet serializes and deserializes attributes into memory to simulate session persistence; therefore, application writers need not turn on session persistence to run this servlet. However, you can run it with persistent sessions enabled. \n\nHow to Access the SessionInspectServlet: \n 1. com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.httpsession.SessionInspectServlet is shipped with WebSphere Application Server. It is already in the classpath and does not need to be added to the application. \n    \n    Define a servlet/uri entry for class SessionInspectServlet. If ServeServletsByClassnameEnabled is set to true (check the ibm-web-ext.xmi file in the WEB-INF directory of your webModule) in your webModule, servlet/uri definition is not needed. \n    \n 2. Restart your Web module.\n    \n 3. Open a browser and access your Web module from the browser, then navigate the application in the browser to populate the session.\n    \n 4. Press Crtl+N to open a new browser, then access the SessionInspectServlet in the new browser by calling the URI that you defined in step 2. If you are using ServeServletsbyClassname, the URI will be \"webapp_context_root\\servlet\\com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.httpsession.SessionInspectServlet\". This displays the session details at that moment. You can access the servlet as you navigate your application to determine the session contents as you go along. Note: The servlet does not support attributes in the session that are outside the WebSphere Application Server scope. That is, session contents need to be accessed by the server class loader scope.\n\n \n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers Runtimes for Java Technology Java SDK", "document_id": "swg21066791", "all_doc_ids": ["swg21304219", "swg1IC36553", "swg24013152", "swg1PK89149", "swg21082645", "swg21643671", "swg1JR59167", "swg1JR50096", "swg1IZ26787", "swg21394062", "swg1PK34875", "swg21988681", "swg1IY94052", "swg21268440", "swg1IZ20675", "swg21656692", "swg1PK48332", "swg1PM83888", "swg1PM82968", "swg1PM83889", "swg1PM45198", "swg1PK90216", "swg1IO20121", "swg1PK46425", "swg1PM90226", "swg1PI37165", "swg21066791", "swg1PK10507", "swg1PM35999", "swg21377774", "swg1IO20582", "swg1PI41248", "swg1JR25711", "swg21558800", "swg1PK29441", "swg1IX90140", "swg1PI17612", "swg1PI30673", "swg1IZ28677", "swg1PI08358", "swg1PK21372", "swg1JR47227", "swg1IO20596", "swg1JR40542", "swg1PM28575", "swg1IO18814", "swg1PM18202", "swg1PK46191", "swg21631634", "swg1IZ76968"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What IBM Business Process Manager version is affected by the Apache Commons FileUpload vulnerability CVE-2016-1000031?

An application server makes it possible for a server to generate a dynamic, customized response to a client request. The Application Server product provides multiple application servers that can be either separately configured processes or nearly identical clones.\n\n * Node Agent - Node agents are administrative agents that represent a node to your system and manage the servers on that node. Node agents monitor application servers on a host system and route administrative requests to servers. A node agent is created automatically when a node is added to a cell.\n\n * Deployment Manager - Deployment managers are administrative agents that provide a centralized management view for all nodes in a cell, as well as management of clusters and workload balancing of application servers across one or several nodes in some editions. A deployment manager hosts the administrative console. A deployment manager provides a single, central point of administrative control for all elements of the entire Application Server distributed cell.\n\n\nAll of the preceding processes represent a Java Virtual Machine (JVM\u2122). For all the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) hang issues, collect the following information. There is a list of links provided at the bottom of this document that routes you to the how-to documents for steps that require additional instructions. \n\nCollect the following information when the application server process (job) is experiencing the problem: \n\nNote: If you are running the Network Deployment (ND) edition of WebSphere Application Server, complete the following steps for the Deployment Manager AND the Federated Node experiencing the problem. \n 1. Run the following commands to collect system information to be sent to IBM:\n    WRKPTFGRP (use F6 to print or send a screen shot showing the installed status of PTFs)\n    \n    DSPPTF OUTPUT(*PRINT)\n    \n    WRKSYSSTS OUTPUT(*PRINT)\n    \n    WRKSBS OUTPUT(*PRINT)\n    \n    WRKSHRPOOL OUTPUT(*PRINT)\n    \n    WRKACTJOB OUTPUT(*PRINT)\n    \n 2.

[http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v5r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/info/welcome_base.html] NOTE: This should be gathered immediately after the problem is recreated.\n    \n 4. Follow instructions to send diagnostic information to IBM support. Appendix B: How to send diagnostic information to IBM support.\n\n\nFor a listing of all technotes, downloads, and educational materials specific to the component, search the WebSphere Application Server support site [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/was/support/]. \n\n\nAppendix A: How to collect a JVM thread dump for a server in a hung state \nMultiple JVMs are available on IBM i 5.4 and higher. The original JVM is known as the \"Classic JVM\" and is considered depricated. The new, preferred JVM is called \"IBM Technology for Java.\" The approach to gather data is different for each JVM, so you will need to figure out which JVM is in use before you proceed. The easiest way to find this is by displaying the job log for the job experiencing the problem. \n\nFor example, if the server is called 'server1', you would run the following from the CL command line: \n\nWRKJOB SERVER1 <enter>\nChoose option 1 to select the active job.\nChoose option 10 to display the job log.\nPress F10 to see all messages The joblog will show: \n\nJava Virtual Machine is IBM Technology for Java. PID(xxx) OR \n\nJava Virtual Machine is Classic. \nJava Virtual Machine is IBM Technology for Java \nGather 3-4 Java Thread Dumps about 1-2 minutes apart and 1 GcCycles Dump for the JVM when it is in the hung state. \n\nNOTE: The \"Classic\" JDK is no longer supported by IBM and thus is not covered in this document. \nThe GcCycles Dump should be taken after the Java Dumps have been gathered. \n\nJava Dump: WRKJVMJOB, Enter option 5 next to the job and press ENTER. Then, proceed to enter option 32 and press ENTER to request a Java dump. \n\nGcCycles Dump: WRKJVMJOB, Enter option 9 next to the job and press ENTER. Then, proceed to press F7 to print the GC tables. \n\n\nAppendix B: How to send diagnostic information to IBM support \nJava Virutal Machine is IBM Technology for Java \n 1. Collect the following:  * WRKPTFGRP \n     * DSPPTF \n     * WRKSYSSTS \n     * WRKSBS \n     * WRKSHRPOOL \n     * Java Dumps \n     * GcCycles Dump\n    \n    \n    To retrieve the file:  1. Open the System i Navigator.\n        \n     2. Expand your system, log in as the user profile who created the spool file.\n        \n     3. Expand Basic Operations, and then left-click on Printer Output to display the output files.\n        \n     4.

Learning more \n 2. Troubleshooting \n 3. Collecting data and contacting IBM \n\n\n1. Learning more\n\n\n * \n * WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliances Product support page\n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  Troubleshooting the IBM WebSphere DataPower appliance. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21515489] Review the following product publications for topics specific to the problem you are troubleshooting by looking at the table of contents and index for related topics.  * Installation \n    * Configuration \n    * CLI \n   \n   The following are additional references which you might find useful when troubleshooting:  * Search IBM Developerworks [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks] website using DATAPOWER as the search argument. \n    * Search IBM website [http://www.ibm.com] using DATAPOWER as the search argument. \n   \n   \n\n2. Troubleshooting  * \n\n 1. Check Object Status.  1. Check the object status in the appropriate domain. The Object Status display indicates the operational state of objects in the system. An object on which a service depends might go down, bringing down the service itself. Log into the domain containing the service to examine to use this feature. On the menu, select Status >Object Status to view this information. Object Status is under the is under the System category in the menu. \n    \n    \n 2. Check for messages in the appliance's system log.  1. Check the System Log in the default domain which contains messages generated by all objects in the system.  1. On the Control Panel, click on the Troubleshooting icon. \n         2. Look for the Logging section. \n         3. Click on View System Logs to review this information. \n        \n        \n     2. During development and troubleshooting, set the Log level to debug.  1. On the Control Panel, click on the Troubleshooting icon. \n         2. Look for the Logging section. \n         3. Select \"debug\" in the Log Level selection box. \n         4. Click on the Set Logging Level button to enable this change. \n         5. A confirmation pop-up window will appear, click Confirm. \n         6. Click on View System Logs to review this information. \n        \n        \n    \n    \n 3. Use the MultiStep Probe to view the data as it passes through the appliance.  1. The MultiStep Probe is very useful during troubleshooting and development. This trace displays the life cycle of the message as it passes through the appliance along with useful system variables. \n     2. The Probe must be enabled for a specific service within a domain. \n     3. Reference the WebGUI publication, Troubleshooting Appendix, MultiStep Probe topic for information on troubleshooting with this trace option. \n    \n    \n 4. Check for changes in the configuration or appliance setup.  1. Check the Audit Log in the default domain. The Audit Log records changes to the configuration of the appliance. On the menu on the left side of the WebGUI, select Status > Audit Log to access this information. Audit Log is under the Main category in the menu. \n     2. Check the running configuration in the default domain. The Running Configuration report could show configuration problems or an unexpected configuration running on the appliance. Confirmed your last saved configuration and the current running configuration are defined as you expect.  1. From the CLI, use the show running-config command\n        \n        \n    \n    \n 5. Check for errors posted by the stylesheet.  1. Check the Stylesheet Status in the appropriate domain. The Stylesheet status can contain error messages that are useful in identifying exceptions during compilation or execution of the stylesheet. This also might indicate that a cached stylesheet, rather than a newer version, was used. On the menu on the left side select Status > Stylesheet Status to view this information. Stylesheet Status is under the XML-Aware Network category in the menu. \n    \n    \n 6. Monitor the system resources on the appliance.  1. Check the Throttle settings. If the system has a Throttle in place, the high memory usage (load) might be causing the throttle to refuse connections. On the menu, select Administration >Throttle Settings to view any active throttles. Throttle Settings is under the Device category in the menu. \n     2. Monitor Filesystem Status in the default domain. The logging system utilize the available file storage space, which prevents the system from writing logs, thus preventing the system from processing messages. On the menu select Status > Filesystem Information to view the available file storage space. Filesystem Information is under the System category in the menu. \n    \n    \n 7. Use the Ping command to provide more information on the network connection.  1. Click on the Troubleshooting icon on the Control Panel. The Ping Remote option under Networking will allow you to ping the IP address or hostname. A pop-up window asks for confirmation when using Ping, then displays the results of the Ping command. \n     2. Ping using the IP address. If the ping command returns \"Action completed successfully! Successful ping to remote host \"testhostname/ip address\", the connection is active. If the command returns a time out or a failure message, one of the following conditions could help identify the problem:  1. The computer that you want to connect to has the ping command disabled, check with the system administrator for that computer. \n         2. The IP address is incorrect; verify the IP address that you are using. \n         3. The computer is not active, ask the system administrator to check the operational status of the computer. \n        \n        \n     3. If you were able to successfully ping the IP address, use the hostname, where hostname is the fully qualified host name of the computer that you want to connect to. If the command returns a time out or a failure message, one of the following could help identify the problem:  1. The host name is incorrect; verify the host name that you are using. \n         2. The Domain Name System (DNS) does not have the host name defined; check with your DNS administrator. \n        \n        \n    \n    \n 8. Run Packet Trace  1. In some instances, it is necessary to capture the full network-level exchange between a appliance and another resource on the network in order to understand what is happening. A Packet Trace contains a capture of network traffic in pcap format.  1. Switch to the default domain. \n         2. On the Control Panel, click on the Troubleshooting icon. \n         3. Look for the Networking section. \n         4. Set the packet capture options available based on your installed firmware level. \n         5.

This command-line tool can gather log file or configuration information and upload it to a Problem Management Record (PMR). This collector is also included in IBM Business Process Manager V8.0.1 Fix Pack 3. \n\nCONTENT\nThe script gathers various product information, compresses it into a .zip file, and can optionally send the compressed file to IBM for a PMR. You can also use this tool to compress the data without sending it to IBM. The command is profile_root/bin/bpmdc\nThe profile_root variable is the base profile directory for the profile from which you want to get data. \n\nCommon Examples \n\nTo gather the logs and upload them to ECURep: \nC:/MyProfileDirectory/bin/bpmdc -PMR=12345.678.901 -uploadToIBM=yes \n\nTo gather the logs and config directory: \n\nC:/MyProfileDirectory/bin/bpmdc -PMR=12345.678.901 -uploadToIBM=yes -config=yes \n\nTo gather logs for installation issues: \n\nC:/MyProfileDirectory/bin/bpmdc -PMR=12345.678.901 -uploadToIBM=yes -type=Install \n\nTo gather 3 java cores from MyAppServer at 60 second intervals: \n\nC:/MyProfileDirectory/bin/bpmdc -PMR=12345.678.901 -uploadToIBM=yes -type=Dump -server=MyAppServer -soapport=8881 -user=admin -password=admin -dumptype=Thread -count=3 -interval=60 \n\n\n\n\n\nCommand Line Parameter Default Value Description PMR None This parameter is the 11-digit PMR number to which the data is associated. Use one of the following forms for this value: 12345.678.901 or \"12345,678,901\"\nNote: Comma characters can be an issue on the Microsoft Windows command-line if you do not surround the value with the double quote characters. uploadToIBM no This parameter specifies whether to upload the data to the IBM ECURep site for a particular PMR. You can set this value to yes or no. outputDirectory install_root/BPM/isadc This parameter specifies the path to the directory where the output collection .zip file will be stored. type General This parameter specifies which type of collection to run. The valid values are General, Install, or Dump(8.5.5). config no With a general collection, when you set this parameter to yes, the config directory is included. You can set this value to yes or no. help No values When you include this parameter with the command, a description of the command options is displayed. Server Connection options added in 8.5.5 \nRequired for -type=Dump server No default This option specifies the server from which you wish to collect JVM dumps. soapport No default This option specifies the SOAP port for the server. user No default This option specifies the user with wsadmin access to the server to which you are connecting. password No default This option specifies the password for the user. Dump options added in 8.5.5 \nAvailable for -type=Dump dumptype Thread This option specifies the type of Java\u2122 virtual machine (JVM) dump to trigger: \nThread - Javacore or thread dump. \nHeap - A Heap dump is generated.\nSystem - System dump is also generated and has JExtract run on it. count 1 This option specifies the number of JVM dumps to trigger during the collection. interval 0 This option specifies the interval in seconds to wait between JVM dumps. \n\nYou can run the command without any parameters, which results in the general collection being run and the logs directory is compressed into a .zip file. \n\n\nThe output file name has the following format: PMRnumber . type _ timeStampValue .zip\nIn V8.5.5 the format is changed to: PMRnumber . ProfileName_type _ timeStampValue .zip \n\n\nThe data gathered is based on the profile where the command is run. If it is run from the installation directory, then the default profile is used. \n\n\nNote: Be sure to run the command from the profile from which you wish to gather data. \n\n\nGeneral collection \nThe \"General\" collection gathers the following information:  * Profile logs directory (profile_root/logs). The collected files include all of the server log files and trace under this profile directory. \n * The results of the versionInfo-maintenancePackages command. \n * (Optionally) The profile config directory (profile_root/config). This directory is only collected when the -config=yes option is used.\n\n\nNote: The limitation with this collection is that it does not gather log files and trace if it goes to a custom directory outside of the Profile logs directory. It is not recommended that you change the log file locations from the default as it makes it more difficult for other people to find them. \n\nInstall collection\nThe \"Install\" collection gathers the following information that is listed in the Collect troubleshooting data for installation or upgrade problems with IBM Business Process Manager products [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21506937] document: \n\n * Any temporary launchpad log files. \n * Installation Manager Data directory \n * The results of the versionInfo -maintenancePackages command \n * Installation logs directory \n * Profile logs directory \n * Database upgrade script log files \n * Various configuration files that are related to the installation process\n\n\n\n\nJVM Dump collection The \"Dump\" collection type triggers various JVM dumps on a target server within a profile prior to gathering the general collection and generated dumps. \n\nWith the provided server connection options, the command will connect to the server using the soapport to make a wsadmin connection with the user and password. Depending on the dump type, it will trigger various JVM dumps until the count amount is reached. The dumps are triggered a set number of seconds apart based on the interval that is set. \n\nThe collection will gather the general collection files like /logs and version information in addition to the dump files like Javacores, heap dumps and system dump .zip files. \n\n * Thread - This type will trigger Javacores or thread dumps to be produced for the JVM. \n * Heap - This type will trigger heap dumps to be generated. \n * System - This type will trigger system dumps to be generated. It will also run JExtract on the dump prior to the upload, which can take some time depending on the heap size. \n\n\n\nCommon usage The following list provides some common usage scenarios for this command: \n\n * After an issue occurs, use the basic bpmdc command to compress the log files for the profile into a .zip file. \n * Recreate your issue after setting a trace string using the administrative console [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/ttrb_entrrs.html] or wsadmin [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/info/ae/ae/txml_troubleshooting.html]. \n   Then, run the bpmdc command to collect the log files and send them to IBM. \n * After opening a PMR, use bpmdc-PMR=PMRnumber-uploadToIBM=yes with the most relevant type options to upload data. \n * IBM Support provides a specific command or set of commands to run for your environment that gets the needed data. \n * IBM Support provides a traces string that needs to be gathered with the commands. With trace enabled, you recreate the issue or wait for a reoccurrence before running the provided commands to gather and upload the data to IBM.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n A simplified Chinese translation is available [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21644209]\n\n\n \n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration IBM Business Process Manager Standard General AIX, Linux, Linux zSeries, Solaris, Windows 8.5 Business Integration IBM Business Process Manager Express General Linux, Linux zSeries, Windows 8.5 \nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n BPM", "document_id": "swg21641516", "all_doc_ids": ["swg21696908", "swg21593461", "swg1JR51672", "swg27036941", "swg1JR47706", "swg1JR53223", "swg1JR51707", "swg21268193", "swg1JR50262", "swg27048992", "swg1JR54678", "swg21402300", "swg21641516", "swg1JR56053", "swg21618716", "swg21321795", "swg1JR51812", "swg21970616", "swg22015932", "swg1JR52960", "swg1JR49076", "swg1JR56224", "swg1JR59057", "swg1JR50224", "swg22013411", "swg22014409", "swg21694924", "swg1JR57253", "swg24030121", "swg21666135", "swg21663802", "swg1JR57059", "swg1JR56456", "swg21611603", "swg1JR56997", "swg1JR56806", "swg21245236", "swg1JR45661", "swg21268903", "swg27037045", "swg1JR56185", "swg21329234", "swg21577551", "swg21972005", "swg21271000", "swg21407074", "swg1JR55899", "swg1JR54145", "swg1JR57127", "swg21680148"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Sometimes, there will be errors/fields missing in typetree, while importing cobol copybooks.

This category encapsulates the time for client-side\n   dedup processing/encryption as well as the network send.\n   - For FULL/IFFULL backups, the buffer is typically filled to 256\n   KB prior to send. With INCR/IFINCR backups, less data might be\n   in the buffer.\n   \n   VM Get Data\n   - Represents time taken to receive data from the Tivoli Storage\n   Manager server.\n   - This can involve fetching control files from the Tivoli\n   Storage Manager server during incremental backup.\n   - Can also involve buffer receives during VM guest restore which\n   will later be written out using \"VM I/O\" writes to VMware.\n   \n   VM Query\n   - Represents queries to the Tivoli Storage Manager server\n   regarding certain options.\n   - Queries conducted to determine if deduplication and/or\n   compression are used. Also node filespace queries (for virtual\n   machines).\n   \n   VM Query VE\n   - Represents query made to VMware to determine changed disk\n   areas (blocks) for VM guest disks. Uses the VMware VI SDK to\n   determine a set of changed blocks.\n   \n   VM Assign\n   - Represents Tivoli Storage Manager server group assignment\n   using the dsmGroupHandler.\n   \n   VM VCM Lock\n   - Represents semaphore locking which takes place during VCMLIB\n   (Volume Control Manager) API calls.\n   - Involves locking for volume control data reads/updates. Block\n   control data manipulation, finding megablocks in a volume, etc.\n   \n   VM Transaction\n   - Represents transaction processing conducted with the Tivoli\n   Storage Manager server (start/end).\n   \n   VM I/O\n   - Represents reading and writing activity done with VMware VM\n   guest disks using the Vix Disk Library for VDDK disks.\n   - This can involve any of the available transport paths (NBD,\n   NBDSSL, SAN, HOTADD) used by the client.\n   - Performance can vary depending on whether the disks being\n   interacted with were thin or thick provisioned - also: whether\n   they were/are lazy zeroed or not.\n   - Reading from VMware disks over SAN has proved somewhat slower\n   than direct reads from the disks using a raw volume I/O tool.\n   - During VM guest backup, reads from VMware (<=256 KB each) are\n   usually interleaved with sends to Tivoli Storage Manager from\n   the same thread (no double-buffering yet in the code).\n   - Represents time reading ctl file from local disk when sending\n   it to the Tivoli Storage Manager server during backup.\n   \n   VM Control File I/O\n   - Represents VM guest CTL file (\"control file\") I/O and\n   interaction.\n   - Writing control files during VM guest operations.\n   \n   Thread Wait\n   - For Tivoli Storage Manager for VE clients, this has been found\n   to represent the time it takes to open and close VDDK disks.\n   - When you see this category, this means that this thread is\n   waiting on the \"utility thread\" to open or close a VDDK (VM\n   guest) disk.\n   - With the Tivoli Storage Manager client during multi-session\n   backup, there can be multiple threads which are backing up VM\n   guests, but only 1 \"utility thread\" opening and closing guest\n   disks.\n   - This is a VMware limitation where the same thread that opens a\n   disk has to close it.\n   - In the General Availability code, disks are opened/closed one\n   at a time by the utility thread, increasing the possibility of\n   bottlenecks for a single client instance.\n   - The utility thread opens/closes the disks via API calls to the\n   VCenter/ESXi host.\n   - The open/close time can also include the time taken to mount\n   the disk on the client/proxy system.\n   \n   Tivoli Storage Manager Versions Affected:\n   Tivoli Storage Manager client 6.4.x. and 7.1.x on all supported\n   platforms\n   \n   Initial Impact:\n   Low\n   \n   Additional Keywords:\n   trace performances doc tuning vm vmware tdp tsm\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nLOCAL FIX\n\nPROBLEM SUMMARY\n *  ****************************************************************\n   * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *\n   * All Tivoli Storage Manager server users.                     *\n   ****************************************************************\n   * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *\n   * See error description.                                       *\n   ****************************************************************\n   * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *\n   * None                                                         *\n   ****************************************************************\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\n *  Information about the Tivoli Storage Manager virtual machine\n   instrumentation categories are available in Technote 1676872 at:\n   http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21676872 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21676872]\n   \n   The same information will be added to the Tivoli Storage Manager\n   Optimizing Performance Guide in the \"Virtual machine\n   instrumentation categories\" topic.\n   \n   Affected platforms: AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, Linux, and Windows.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nTEMPORARY FIX\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nAPAR INFORMATION\n * APAR NUMBER\n   IT02526\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT NAME\n   TSM CLIENT\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT ID\n   5698ISMCL\n   \n   \n * REPORTED RELEASE\n   71W\n   \n   \n * STATUS\n   CLOSED DOC\n   \n   \n * PE\n   NoPE\n   \n   \n * HIPER\n   NoHIPER\n   \n   \n * SPECIAL ATTENTION\n   NoSpecatt\n   \n   \n * SUBMITTED DATE\n   2014-06-13\n   \n   \n * CLOSED DATE\n   2014-07-16\n   \n   \n * LAST MODIFIED DATE\n   2014-07-16\n   \n   \n\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED FROM ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n * APAR IS SYSROUTED TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n\nFIX INFORMATION\n\nAPPLICABLE COMPONENT LEVELS", "document_id": "swg1IT02526", "all_doc_ids": ["swg1IV63361", "swg1IT04266", "swg1IT02526", "swg21995412", "swg1IT10369", "swg21960279", "swg1IT07592", "swg21696736", "swg21681725", "swg1VM17818", "swg21960843", "swg1IV59260", "swg21506568", "swg1IT15182", "swg21643349", "swg1IC89340", "isg3T1011035", "swg1IT04330", "swg1IT03221", "swg1IC76102", "swg1HD88448", "swg21496993", "swg1IC76101", "swg1IT18594", "swg21997590", "swg1IC79885", "swg21616165", "swg1IT15030", "swg1IC80120", "swg21968438", "swg1IC99000", "swg21600019", "swg21659826", "swg1IV52535", "swg22002971", "swg1IT13317", "swg1IV13286", "swg21676872", "swg1IC91073", "swg1IV20621", "swg21974404", "swg1IV37321", "swg21982465", "swg21997588", "swg21615651", "swg1IT06598", "swg1IT04713", "swg21983659", "swg1VM18480", "swg1JR48553"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I need to understand details regarding Security Bulletin: IBM WebSphere MQ Administration command could cause denial of service (CVE-2016-8971).

This is especially true after an abnormal system end. \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n \n\nAll access paths over physical files that were currently in use during an abnormal system end will need to be recovered. If the access path was journaled the system can recover from the journal. If it is not journaled then the access path will be marked invalid and must be completely rebuilt When this rebuild will happen is depended on the file attributes. \n\nIssue DSPFD command for your files, and look for Access Path Recovery. \n\nA value of *IPL will rebuild during the IPL.\nA value of *AFTIPL will rebuild after the IPL.\nA value of *NO will require a user to open the file directly to force the rebuild.\n\nWhen an access path is marked invalid users may experience slower performance than normal or errors with not being able to validate or use an access path.\n\nUsing the EDTRBDAP Command\n\nTo check for access paths that are invalid, run the EDTRBDAP command. The command has no parameters. Typing the command and pressing the Enter key will not start any work on the system. You will see a screen of all the access paths that are invalid on the system. If all access paths on the system are valid, you will see \"No Access Paths to Display.\" The access paths that have the sequence of *OPN means that the access path will be rebuilt when the file is next opened by a user. \n\nBased on what you know about your data, you may decide some files are more important than others and need to have their access paths rebuilt first. Number 1 is the highest priority, and number 99 is the lowest priority. Type the desired numeric value under Sequence (in place of where it might say *OPN). You can assign a numeric value to just one file or several files at a time. When you press the Enter key, the rebuild starts on the files that have a number. You can also give all files the same number which allows the system to start at the top of the list and rebuild to the bottom of the list. To do this, assign a number to one file and then press F13 (shift + F1) to assign that same number to all the files listed. \n\nThe number of access paths rebuilt is based on the number of QDBSRV jobs. The number of QDBSRV jobs is determined at the time of IPL or IASP vary on. If you have Symmetric Multi Processing installed and if you have extra CPU you wish to give to access path rebuilds, you can use the following command: CHGQRYA JOB(123456/QSYS/QDBSRV04) DEGREE(*MAX) \n\nThe above option is for use only when you want to give the highest priority to access path rebuild. Use the DEGREE(*MAX) parameter value only if you have plenty of CPU to spare and want the access path rebuild to take that CPU. \n\nFor more suggestions on speeding up access path refer to document - N1013641 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1013641].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Operating System IBM i 7.2 Operating System IBM i 7.1 Operating System IBM i 6.1 \nHISTORICAL NUMBER\n 463676089", "document_id": "nas8N1014114", "all_doc_ids": ["swg1SA96266", "swg1SE38523", "swg1SA96051", "swg21174095", "swg21318667", "swg1PM63493", "swg1SE25204", "swg21656085", "swg21622020", "swg1PM58956", "swg21106807", "swg1PM53107", "swg21625059", "swg21237907", "swg21441967", "swg21417618", "swg1IZ00609", "swg21286821", "swg21297570", "swg21299323", "isg3T1013618", "swg1SE19791", "nas8N1011025", "swg1IZ68805", "swg1PK86224", "swg21515197", "swg1PK85218", "swg21414283", "swg1PI20391", "swg21643097", "swg21472728", "swg1IY85806", "nas8N1021768", "nas8N1014585", "swg21574986", "swg1IZ59759", "swg1IV11260", "swg1IY92127", "swg1SE61237", "swg1PK98959", "nas8N1014114", "nas8N1014919", "swg21623407", "swg21424924", "swg21524027", "nas8N1017503", "swg1IZ96837", "nas8N1016329", "swg21607534", "swg21142296"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I see this exception in WebSphere Application Server J2c and RRA traces:\n\nWSRdbManagedC > preTestConnection Entry WSRdbManagedConnectionImpl@51a507f2 query: SELECT 1 FROM DUAL WSRdbManagedC 3 Exception java.sql.SQLException: ORA-02396: exceeded maximum idle time, please connect again DSRA0010E: SQL State = 61000, Error Code = 2,396 at oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CTTIoer.processError(T4CTTIoer.java:440) at \n...\nEntry java.sql.SQLException: ORA-01012: not logged on .....

The tool is used to convert time columns to columns that can support time values past 2038. It also converts byte-based string data columns to character-based columns for better support of multi-byte character sets. \n\nCONTENT\n1 Overview \n\nThe following information is intended for a database administrator who, in conjunction with the Process Engine administrator, is involved in planning a Process Engine upgrade to Content Platform Engine version 5.2.\n\nAfter you upgrade the Process Engine database to the Content Platform Engine 5.2 workflow system by using the peupgrade tool, you can run the pedbconvert tool. The tool makes database changes that enable support for dates beyond 2038 and for byte-based to character-based strings conversion, which includes support for GB18050 character sets. The pedbconvert tool applies only to DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server databases; it is not necessary for Oracle databases. Run the pedbconvert tool if the database was upgraded from Process Engine 4.5.x or if the advanced upgrade tool was not run for the previous Process Engine 5.0 upgrade. \n\nThe pedbconvert tool does not need to be run if your server isolated regions were created with the Process Engine 5.0 software.\n\nYou can run the pedbconvert tool any time after you complete the upgrade of the Process Engine database. You will want to schedule the run sooner after upgrade in the following cases: \n\n * You need support for dates beyond 2038. \n * You need support for GB18030 character sets with a SQL Server database. \n * You have had improperly truncated strings with multibyte characters, where a partial character is left at the end of a string. \n * During the upgrade, you could not accurately estimate how many bytes are in a character (called the expansion factor) for your database character set. \n * You are running on MS SQL Server. Performance issues could be experienced when indexes include keys that are string columns which have not been converted.\n\n\nThe workflow system isolated region is locked while the pedbconvert tool is running so the region along with its work items are not accessible during this time. To minimize disruptions, run the pedbconvert tool at a maintenance interval when users are not accessing the system. 2 Using the pedbconvert tool \n\nThe pedbconvert tool converts the database of the isolated region that is specified by the connection point parameter. If you run the tool without any parameters, all tables in the region are converted. Conversion of 32-bit to 64-bit time fields and the conversion of string field data types in user tables are completed for the isolated region. After the tool is run with the default settings, the database column size factor becomes obsolete and the tool does not need to be run again for the isolated region.\n\n\n\nDatabase String field data type New string field data type ORACLE* varchar(20) varchar(20 CHAR) DB2 9.7 and later Varchar Vargraphic MS SQL Varchar Nvarchar \nDatabase Time field data type New time field data type ORACLE* number(10) number(19) DB2 Integer Bigint MS SQL Integer Bigint \n* The Oracle conversion is done automatically during upgrade when you use the peupgrade tool. \n\nYou can use the pedbconvert tool to change the database column size factor if, during the upgrade, the size factor was not accurately estimated. Use the \u2013f option with a size 3 - 6. If you do not run the pedbconvert tool, the same conversion occurs on queues and rosters if a transfer operation is done, and that queue or roster is modified. The transfer does not, however, convert date or string fields on logs if logs are modified. The conversion that is done by the transfer does not take any additional time beyond what transfer would take if you already ran the pedbconvert tool.\n\nIMPORTANT In Process Engine 5.0 and Content Platform Engine 5.2, the required character set for DB2 is UTF-8. UTF-8 is required in DB2 to support the vargraphic data types that are used as the standard in Content Platform Engine 5.2. \n\n\n\n2.1 Setup \n\nBefore you run the pedbconvert tool, back up your workflow system database. \n\nConsider using a replica of the Process Engine database to perform the upgrade and optionally run the pedbconvert tool. By performing these steps with a replica database before you actually upgrade the database, you can determine if configuration changes, such as increasing page sizes, are required. You can also determine the time that is required to perform the database upgrade and run the pedbconvert tool. For more information about using replica systems and databases, see Migration upgrade overview and roadmap [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/p8docs/v5r2m0/topic/com.ibm.p8.planprepare.doc/p8ppu118.htm]. \n\nBased on the time that is required to complete the upgrade and optionally run the pedbconvert tool, you can determine whether both can be completed at the time of the Process Engine database upgrade for Content Platform Engine 5.2 or if only the upgrade can be completed and the pedbconvert must be scheduled for a later time. \n\n\nThe pedbconvert tool is installed as part of the Tools component when you install Content Platform Engine. \n\n2.2 Background \n\n\nString fields\nFor SQL Server and DB2 databases, moving to character-based string fields might require more database space. If the majority of the data consists of single-byte ASCII characters, the use of nvarchar and vargraphic data types approximately doubles the required space. But if the characters are from a Chinese character set, for example, where most characters are already double or triple byte, the amount of database space that is used might be reduced when the database uses nvarchar and vargraphic data types.\n\nIf, however, nvarchar or vargraphic are not used, you must choose an expansion factor, which indicates how many bytes are used per character. This expansion factor must be chosen based on the database character set and language that used at your site. Most character sets can be accommodated by an expansion factor of 3. Some character sets, however, have as many as 6 bytes per character, so a value up to 6 might be needed. \n\nIt is expected that DB2 has a 32K page size. The maximum declared sizes of all columns in a table cannot exceed the page size. Choosing too high an expansion factor for DB2 might result in an error: maximum page size exceeded. For details, see techdocs 7020392 and 7036552, which document DB2 table space page size and database requirements and how to determine Process Engine table space page size requirements.\n\nDate fields\nIf you choose not to convert to 64-bit date fields, you might experience the following issues: \n\n * If a work object is dispatched to a queue that exposes a 32-bit time field and the value is a 64-bit value, an error occurs and the work object is moved to the malfunction map. \n * If Process Engine attempts to add a record to a log table where the date value exceeds the exposed 32-bit field, the following data is given:  * In the log record, the value is truncated to a flag value to fit in the 32-bit column 1/18/2038 7FFFFFFE. Also, the F_Text field of the record contains information about the overflowed column name and its original value before truncation. \n    * In the system log, a message states that the log record that is specified by table name, eventtype, and timestamp is adjusted for 32-bit columns where the value exceeds the field size. This is a hint that the column size must be changed to accommodate the larger value in the event log.\n   \n   \n   \n\n2.3 Usage statement Usage: pedbconvert connection_point\n{-h }\n[-f size_factor ]\n[-Y user_name+password]\n\nDescription of parameters:\n\nconnection_point:The connection point name to the specific workflow system on which you want pedbconvert to run.\n\n-h: Displays the parameters and descriptions.\n\n-f size_factor: The database column size factor. If this option is specified, the queue, roster, and log tables are expanded for character column length. Valid size factors are 3 through 6.

The following Wiki page has been published on the topic:\nhttps://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/Tivoli+Composite+Application+Manager/page/Pruning+SDMS+Relationship+Metrics+Tables [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/Tivoli+Composite+Application+Manager/page/Pruning+SDMS+Relationship+Metrics+Tables]\n\nTo keep only the latest 24 hours every day (regular pruning), you can schedule a daily job to run the kd4TrimDB2db utility provided above. \n\nAs for the newer ITCAM for SOA 7.2, there is a cleanup task that runs on the TEPS host where SDMS database is installed. It deletes REQMETRICS and RESPMETRICS table rows where SRTTIME (start of period) is more than 24 hours ago.

During the SSL/TLS handshake, there is a certificate verification step where the client verifies the server certificate and optionally the server verifies the client's certificate. \nEndpoints (controllers and targets) do not need a certificate but brokers do need one. \nThe problem is, during the TLS/SSL handshake, the broker does not yet \nknow if the client is an endpoint or another broker, which means that it \ndoesn't know if it has to ask for a client certificate or not. Hence, \nthe broker always requests a client certificate and if the client sends \na certificate, the broker verifies it. Then, after the SSL/TLS handshake \nhas completed, the broker determines the type of client. Now that the \nbroker knows the type of client, it can check if a certificate is \nrequired and refuse the connection when the client did not provide a \ncertificate if one was required.", "document_id": "swg21621956", "all_doc_ids": ["swg21978580", "swg1ZZ00618", "swg1PK04494", "swg1ZZ00703", "swg1IV53276", "swg21395250", "swg21678284", "swg1PK60693", "swg21394300", "swg1IY49156", "swg21961972", "swg21979327", "swg21980784", "swg21981181", "swg21997147", "swg21419276", "swg21972158", "swg21970509", "swg1PK58426", "swg1PK52674", "swg21980674", "swg21544877", "swg21390809", "swg1PK86244", "swg21620814", "swg21586705", "swg21678895", "swg21972360", "swg21670474", "swg21681501", "swg1IY95029", "swg1PI96508", "swg1IZ67640", "swg1PM70080", "swg21982133", "swg1IC80763", "swg21616440", "swg1IZ64432", "swg1PK62726", "swg21985640", "swg1IT22689", "swg21962719", "swg1IC96648", "swg1IY66589", "swg21522432", "swg21621956", "ssg1S1009322", "swg22003801", "swg21649041", "swg21633649"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "How do I modify the JP sheet to include the JOBTASK Long description in the query.

When this limit is\n   reached or exceeded, the applications managed by the\n   operating system may become unstable and/or crash.\n   .\n   Depending on the machine configuration memory, other active\n   user objects, other memory intensive application etc opening\n   several CATDrawings containing large number of sheets in each\n   drawing file may raise the number of USER objects up to the\n   operating system limit or higher.\n   This can lead to instability and/or crash.\n   .\n   Reason:\n   The instability and/or crash reported in such scenario depend\n   on the machine configuration.\n   Stability of applications cannot be insured in case such a\n   limit is reached.\n   Depending on other running applications, machine\n   configuration etc, the limit for USER OBJECTS may increase or\n   decrease.\n   Hence, it is not possible to generically and concretely\n   specify what number of CATDrawing files or what exact number\n   of sheets per drawing file will lead to this behavior.\n   This depends on the machine / OS configuration and capability.\n   .\n   .\n   RECOMMENDATION:\n   User should not open multiple files having such large number\n   of sheets simultaneously.\n   Work on individual files as far as possible.\n   \n   \n    \n   \n   \n\nTEMPORARY FIX\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nAPAR INFORMATION\n * APAR NUMBER\n   HD90634\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT NAME\n   CATIA V5 NT>XP\n   \n   \n * REPORTED COMPONENT ID\n   569151000\n   \n   \n * REPORTED RELEASE\n   519\n   \n   \n * STATUS\n   CLOSED PRS\n   \n   \n * PE\n   NoPE\n   \n   \n * HIPER\n   NoHIPER\n   \n   \n * SPECIAL ATTENTION\n   NoSpecatt\n   \n   \n * SUBMITTED DATE\n   2009-11-10\n   \n   \n * CLOSED DATE\n   2009-12-15\n   \n   \n * LAST MODIFIED DATE\n   2009-12-15\n   \n   \n\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED FROM ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n * APAR IS SYSROUTED TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\n   \n   \n   \n\nFIX INFORMATION\n\nAPPLICABLE COMPONENT LEVELS", "document_id": "swg1HD90634", "all_doc_ids": ["swg1IC90334", "swg1IC47696", "swg1IC66611", "swg1PK01629", "swg21297518", "swg1IZ04919", "swg1IC60120", "swg1PM19968", "swg21638442", "swg1IC53570", "swg1IC92621", "swg1IT13614", "swg21605958", "swg21293884", "swg21972624", "swg1PI29753", "swg1RS03008", "swg1IT16348", "swg1PK48079", "swg1HD90634", "swg1PI92264", "swg1IC92219", "swg1PK97749", "swg1IT07784", "swg1IT09062", "swg21975955", "swg21676279", "swg1PM93839", "swg1PK06220", "swg1PM03023", "swg1PK14161", "swg1PK87048", "swg1HE05535", "swg1PK24480", "swg1IC62716", "swg21667478", "swg21427763", "swg1IZ75741", "swg1IC37785", "swg27017027", "swg1PQ83057", "swg21403353", "swg21458590", "swg1PI93175", "swg1PI32056", "swg27020867", "swg21367040", "swg21289019", "swg1PK21574", "swg21322528"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I am looking to leverage the SAML TAI provided by WebSphere Application Server for my WebSphere Portal 8.0 environment.

Portal then uses this value to query Virtual Member Manager (VMM) via findUserByIdentifier() and the failure occurs since the value is not formatted as a distinguished name.\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\n- Collect Portal Login troubleshooting data [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21592791] \n\n- Look for the following in security.xml:\n<interceptors xmi:id=\"TAInterceptor_<identifier>\" interceptorClassName=\"com.ibm.ws.security.web.saml.ACSTrustAssociationInterceptor\">\n...\n<trustProperties xmi:id=\"Property_<identifier>\" name=\"sso_1.sp.idMap\" value=\"idAssertion\"/> \n\nNote: There may be more than one sso_<n>.sp.idMap property (for example, sso_1.sp.idMap, sso_2.sp.idMap, etc). \n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n \n\nOption #1: \n\nThe idAssertion value means that no entry is necessary for the user in the user registry, which is not supported in WebSphere Portal by default. Update the sso_<n>.sp.idMap property via the Integrated Solutions Console to use the value \"localRealm\" instead of \"idAssertion.\" \n\nThe localRealm value ensures that WebSphere Application Server will complete the JAAS Subject with the full distinguished name for the user by querying the user registry and thus Portal will pass the correct format to VMM. \n\nOption #2: \n\nTransient user support [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHRKX_8.5.0/mp/overview/new_cf08.dita?lang=en] has been introduced for SAML TAI [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHRKX_8.5.0/mp/wcm/wcm_secure_int_tai_auth.dita?lang=en] starting with Cumulative Fix (CF) #8 for 8.5.

As a result, this document will no longer contain a quarterly summary of content. We would like to encourage you to engage with the IBM Business Process Manager Team in our social channels. \n\nCONTENT\nRecent industry surveys show a trend towards social content that allows clients to collaborate with companies like IBM. As part of becoming more social, IBM Business Process Manager Support will no longer be sending out emails for the quarterly Support Newsletters or updating the associated featured links that were previously in this on-line document. \n\nIn addition to blogging, tweeting, and posting to Facebook and YouTube, the IBM Business Process Manager support team is now posting questions and answers on developerWorks Answers (dW Answers ) [https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/] where anyone can contribute easily. You can \"Like\", \"Unlike\", or \"Comment\" on any question or answer. You can post questions and receive responses from the community of users and many of them are IBMers. You can also share your expertise by answering questions from others in the community.\n\ndW Answers makes it easy to view content in different ways. For example, you can view the Newest content tagged with BPM on dW Answers [https://developer.ibm.com/answers/topics/bpm/?sort=newest]or view theBPM content with the most Likes on dW Answers [https://developer.ibm.com/answers/topics/bpm/?sort=votes]. From any question with the BPM tag, you can click the tag then click \"+Follow\" to be notified by email of things like new questions asked or new answers accepted. You define the email notifications that you want and the frequency by setting up \"My preferences\" within dW Answers. You can also follow tags using the RSS feed. \n\nIf you would like to add and find content for WebSphere Lombardi Edition on dW Answers, use the Lombardi tag. For WebSphere Process Server, use the WPS tag.\n\nIf you would like to see IBM Business Process Manager content and other related content shortly after it is published to the various social channels including dW Answers, make sure that you followIBM_BPM on Twitter [https://twitter.com/IBM_BPM].\n\nAs a result of these changes, this document will be removed from the web in January of 2016 so please bookmark the new pages.\n\n\n\n\nORIGINAL PUBLICATION DATE\n 2013/9/17 \n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration WebSphere Process Server Documentation AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, Windows, z/OS 7.0, 6.2, 6.1.2, 6.1 Business Integration WebSphere Lombardi Edition Documentation AIX, Linux, Solaris, Windows 7.2, 7.1 Business Integration IBM Business Process Manager Advanced Documentation AIX, Linux, Linux zSeries, Solaris, Windows, z/OS 8.5, 8.0.1, 8.0, 7.5.1, 7.5 Business Integration IBM Business Process Manager Express Documentation Linux, Windows 8.5, 8.0.1, 8.0, 7.5.1, 7.5 PRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n WebSphere Process Server\nWPS\nWebSphere Lombardi Edition\nWLE\nIBM Business Process Manager\nBPM", "document_id": "swg27008332", "all_doc_ids": ["swg21615564", "swg1IC82062", "swg21615128", "swg27025165", "swg1JR42214", "swg21625270", "swg21643921", "swg1JR43539", "swg21883360", "swg21679714", "swg21620656", "swg27036139", "swg21620021", "swg21473894", "swg21613989", "swg21668180", "swg21508974", "swg27037045", "swg21660915", "swg1IC90192", "swg1JR56223", "swg1JR55110", "swg21439613", "swg21680795", "swg21470772", "swg27008332", "swg24031822", "swg1JR54070", "swg1JR54682", "swg1IT07386", "swg1JR49171", "swg21506999", "swg21611091", "swg21618580", "swg21700831", "swg1JR50211", "swg1JR51286", "swg21579275", "swg1JR53081", "swg1JR50221", "swg24027951", "swg24027952", "swg21633799", "swg21647104", "swg1JR48205", "swg1IT06812", "swg21998655", "swg24028645", "swg21439836", "swg24028665"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Why I am not able to login to StoredIQ Dataserver and Getway using ssh?

This typically is caused by a firewall or other network issues. However, transaction timeout values defined in the WebSphere Application Server Administration Console do not time out the socketRead0 operation. Therefore, threads that are hung in that condition would not time out as desired.\n\nANSWER\nThe cause of the dropped connection should be investigated and resolved. Investigating the cause can take time, requiring a need for immediate relief, particularly on a production environment.\n\n\nThe blockingReadConnectionTimeout custom property in the data source can time out the SocketInputStream.socketRead0 operation. \n\nTo add the blockingReadConnectionTimeout property: \n\n 1.  Open the WebSphere Application Server Administration Console. \n 2.  Expand Resources. \n 3.  Expand JDBC. \n 4.  Click Data sources. \n 5.  Click the \"WebSphere Commerce DB2 Datasource demo\" datasource in the main window. \n 6.  In the Additional Properties section, click Custom Properties. \n 7.  Click New. \n 8.  In the Name field, type blockingReadConnectionTimeout \n 9.  In the Value field, specify the time in seconds in which you want to time out after, for example: 900 \n 10. Click Apply then OK. \n 11. Save your changes \n 12. Restart the WebSphere Application Server.\n\n\nThe amount of time in seconds before a connection socket read times out. This property applies only to IBM Data Server Driver for JDBC and SQLJ type 4 connectivity, and affects all requests that are sent to the data source after a connection is successfully established. The default value is 0. A value of 0 means that there is no time out. When the blockingReadConnectionTimeout property is enabled and a hung thread condition occurs, the relevant lines in the logs would appear: \n\n[1/2/12 1:23:45:678 EDT] 0000001c ThreadMonitor W WSVR0605W: Thread \"WebContainer : 15\" (00000045) has been active for 722010 milliseconds and may be hung.

How do I correct this problem? \n\nCAUSE\nThere are multiple causes for this behavior.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThere are multiple causes for this behavior requiring different responses:\n\n\n(1) Using a license authorization code from an older version of a SPSS product on a newer version of the License Manager can result in this behavior. If the product version is supported, please contact IBM SPSS Support for assistance. If the product is no longer supported, IBM SPSS does not provide support with unsupported product versions. The recommendation of IBM SPSS Support would be to migrate to supported products. \n\n(2) Using a license authorization code of a newer product on an older version of the License Manager can result in this behavior. Please upgrade your License Manager to the current version. \n\n (3) Using an Authorized User (and not a Concurrent) license authorization code to license a License Manager can result in this behavior. Acquire and apply a Concurrent license authorization code for use with the License Manager. \n\n(4) Using the Sentinel RMS License Server Administrator (WlmAdmin) tool 'Add Feature' right-click menu option to add either as license authorization code or license code will result in this behavior. Use the 'licenseactivator' license authorization tool from the operating system command line. \n\nIf you have confirmed that 'Error 92' does not result from 1-4 above, the problem may corrected by manually adding the license code to the Sentinel RMS License Manager license file -- lservrc -- located in the installation directory of the Sentinel RMS License Manager. Confirmation of 1-3 can be performed in the License Key Center or by opening a service request with IBM SPSS Client Care and providing the authorization license code(s) to be analyzed.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Need more help?

This will be in the form of an empty black box (PDF) or will be a missing pictures icon (Excel).\n\n\nCAUSE\nThere are a few common causes for this issue: \n\n 1. The permissions of the folder which contains the image, have not been configured correctly \n 2. The image is not within the directory which is specified \n 3. The directory where the image is meant to be stored, does not exist in the specified location\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nTo find out the root cause of this problem, you will need to use tools that monitor and record all actions attempted against the Operating System Registry. \n\nIn THIS scenario the tool used was Process Monitor and the Web Server was IIS 7.5. \n\n \n\n 1.  Download Process Monitor tool (Make sure you run it from the same machine Cognos is installed on) \n 2.  Open up the report in Cognos Workspace \n 3.  Load up Process Monitor \n 4.  You will notice the current processes immediately being captured and displaying in the window. Press the Capture / Ctrl+E Icon (Magnifying Glass) to stop the capture of events. \n 5.  Press the Clear / Ctrl+X icon (Eraser) to remove all the recorded entries. \n 6.  Press the capture icon in process monitor \n 7.  Export the report to Excel 2007/PDF \n 8.  Save the file anywhere \n 9.  Press the Capture icon again in process monitor to stop the capturing of events. \n 10. Press the Find Icon / Ctrl+F and type \"[Image Name]\" to make sure the filter image event was captured. \n 11. You should be able to see the reason why the image could not be saved under the 'Result' column.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nIf the image is found but cannot be accessed due to permission configuration issue: \n\n \n\n 1. Open up IIS 7.5 \n 2. Click on the root folder of your Cognos installation (E.g. C1021GA) in the navigation pane on the left side \n 3. When the root folder is selected, double-click 'Authentication' \n 4. Ensure that anonymous access is enabled \n 5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the image folder and it's parent folder. \n 6. If the user is concerned about security, they may want to restrict the child-folders (E.g. cgi-bin) and change the authentication settings accordingly \n 7.

If this return nothing, then we get an error. If it does return something, then the File Import component will be able to remove anything which is not a file.\n\nIt explain why the file specification '*.*' never return an error as from a command prompt, if you type 'dir *.*', it will return something (at least directories '.' and '..').\nIt also explain why creating a directory called 'something.tif' allow us to avoid the error.\n\nMy Customer is happy with the workaround.\n\nI also created a product Suggestion so we can configure File Import to not generate an error message when there is no file to import.\n\n\n\nHISTORICAL NUMBER\n 10003742 \n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n CAPTURE PROFESSIONAL", "document_id": "swg21274685", "all_doc_ids": ["swg21613104", "swg21400677", "swg21283090", "swg21426569", "swg21274685", "swg21997639", "ibm10718857", "swg21167228", "swg27015256", "swg21400016", "swg21503607", "swg1IY47581", "swg21167118", "swg21450615", "swg22004739", "swg21181287", "swg1PM15197", "swg27023930", "swg21625441", "swg21625508", "swg1IV19890", "swg21480020", "swg21508883", "swg21600475", "swg27015668", "swg1LO92133", "swg21438944", "swg21480080", "swg22013721", "swg27021567", "isg3T1013139", "swg1LO60313", "swg21182247", "swg22001253", "swg21325537", "swg21511904", "swg1PK85746", "swg1LO44845", "swg21399949", "swg27021149", "nas8N1019016", "swg1IZ85449", "swg21400034", "swg21981743", "swg21512391", "swg27024145", "swg1IZ53960", "isg3T7000093", "swg21439774", "swg21477023"]}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I need to understand details regarding Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in Diffie-Hellman ciphers known as Logjam affects IBM WebSphere Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus (CVE-2015-4000).
