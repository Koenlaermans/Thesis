APPOINTMENT AND SCOPE OF AUTHORITY\n\n1.1 The parties hereby agree that the Terminated Agreement shall terminate and cease to have effect for all purposes, and shall simultaneously be replaced by this Agreement, with effect from 25 September 2018 (the \"Effective Date\").

The Service Fee shall also be reduced by any amounts earned on cash and cash-equivalents held by the Sub-Advisor pursuant to this Agreement.\n\n3.3 The Service Fee shall be reviewed by Oaktree US and the Sub-Advisor once annually (or as the parties agree) for continued appropriateness and in particular, to account for any changes in the Sub-Advisor's business.\n\n4. ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS\n\nOaktree US and its affiliates will provide all fund and investor accounting, fund investor reporting, custodial services and similar administrative functions required in respect of the Funds. Oaktree US will provide such services in a manner and quality consistent with past practices in connection with the management of the Funds.\n\n5. CUSTODY\n\n5.1 All documents of or evidencing title to the Funds' investments shall be held in safe custody facilities by a custodian to be selected by Oaktree US (the \"Custodian\") subject to the terms of a custody agreement made between Oaktree US and the Custodian and subject to such other arrangements and procedures as may be agreed between Oaktree US and the Custodian from time to time. The Sub-Advisor shall at no time have custody or physical control of the invested assets of the Funds nor shall it be liable for any act or omission of the Custodian.\n\n5.2 Oaktree US shall take such additional steps (in addition to the authorities and powers hereby conferred) as are necessary to procure that the Sub- Advisor is able, on behalf of Oaktree US, to operate the bank accounts of the Funds so far as necessary for the Sub-Advisor to exercise all of its powers and discretions and perform all of its duties under this Agreement.\n\n6. RECORDS AND REPORTS\n\n6.1 The Sub-Advisor shall maintain proper and complete records relating to the services to be provided under this Agreement for such period of time as may be required under Applicable Law, including (as applicable, in respect of the relevant Discretionary Funds) records with respect to the acquisition, holding and disposal of securities on behalf of the Funds, details of all brokers used and the aggregate dollar amount of brokerage commission paid in that regard to each broker.\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2 Except as expressly authorised in this Agreement or as required by Applicable Law, regulation or court order, or as directed by Oaktree US in writing, the Sub-Advisor shall keep confidential the records and other information pertaining to Oaktree US and the Funds or the investment assets the subject of this Agreement (save for any records or information pertaining to the Sub-Advisor's own employees and affiliates, which shall be excluded from the obligations contained in this clause).

LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION\n\n7.1 In providing its services under this Agreement, the Sub-Advisor will discharge its duties in accordance with the same standard of care established for Oaktree US in the relevant Fund Agreements, and will be indemnified by each of the Funds as an agent of Oaktree US in accordance with such Fund Agreements. To the extent Oaktree US and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, shareholders, assigns, representatives or agents (apart from the Sub-Advisor) (collectively, \"Oaktree US Indemnities\") suffer any liability, loss (including amounts paid in settlement), damages or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) (collectively \"Losses\") in connection with the Funds, and:-\n\n(a) Oaktree US Indemnities are not indemnified by the Funds for such Losses under the indemnification provisions of the applicable Fund Agreements;\n\n(b) such Losses were suffered by virtue of the Sub-Advisor's or its employees' acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions under this Agreement; and\n\n(c) the Sub-Advisor (including its employees) is guilty of negligence or wilful misconduct,\n\nthen the Sub-Advisor will hold Oaktree US Indemnities harmless and indemnify it for such Losses; provided that the Sub-Advisor shall not be liable for actions or omissions to act ordered by Oaktree US to which the Sub-Advisor objected in writing at the time of such order.\n\n7.2 The provisions of this Clause 7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\n\n8.

The alternative investment fund manager of each Fund and New Fund which is an alternative investment fund shall be Oaktree US, unless otherwise agreed.\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n10.

If Agency enters into a subagency agreement under which the                   subagency has the right to retain ownership of expirations on                   business produced by the subagency, then the purchase of                   expirations under subparagraph 1 above will not include the                   purchase of those subagency expirations, and the purchase                   price paid to Agency will not include the commissions paid for                   such business produced by the subagency.\n\n                                      -3-\n\nE.       AGENCY'S ERRORS AND OMISSION, AND FIDELITY & ELECTRONIC CRIME INSURANCE\n\n         The Agency will maintain valid errors and omissions insurance, with          minimum limits of $1,000,000 per incident, and a fidelity and          electronic crime policy through an insurer, both of which shall contain          terms and limits of coverage acceptable to MICOA covering the Agency's          solicitors and each of its employees. The Agency shall provide MICOA a          copy of each policy; doing so on a regular and current basis shall be a          precondition to all of Agency's rights under this Agreement, including          but not limited to the payment of all earned commissions.\n\nF.       TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT\n\n         1.       This agreement shall terminate:\n\n                  a.       Automatically if any public authority cancels or                            declines to renew the Agency's license or Certificate                            of Authority.\n\n                  b.       Immediately if either party gives detailed written                            notice to the other of alleged gross and willful                            misconduct, fraud or material misrepresentation.\n\n         2.       This Agreement shall terminate, subject to any automatic                   renewal or extension for one year as required by law, upon                   either party giving at least one hundred twenty (120) days                   advance written notice to the other, if not otherwise contrary                   to applicable law or this Agreement.\n\n         3.       If the Agency is delinquent in either accounting or payment of\n\n\n\n\n\n                  monies due MICOA, MICOA may by written notice to the Agency                   immediately terminate, suspend or modify any of the provisions                   of this agreement. Such action shall not be taken by MICOA                   over minor differences between the records of the Agency and                   MICOA.\n\n         4.       All supplies, including forms and policies furnished by MICOA                   and any copies or other reproductions of them, shall remain                   the property of MICOA and shall be returned to MICOA or its                   representative upon demand.\n\nG.       INDEMNIFICATION\n\n         The respective parties shall indemnify and hold one another harmless as          follows:\n\n                                      -4-\n\n         1.       MICOA shall indemnify and hold Agency harmless against any                   MICOA act or omission, except to the extent the Agency has                   caused, compounded, or contributed to such error.\n\n         2.       Agency shall indemnify and hold Agency harmless against any                   act or omission of the Agency, except to the extent MICOA has                   caused, compounded, or contributed to such error.\n\n         3.       The Agency and MICOA shall properly notify one another upon                   receiving notice of the commencement of any action related to                   such liabilities. MICOA shall be entitled to participate in                   any such action or in consultation with Agency and its carrier                   to assume the defense of any such action. If MICOA assumes the                   defense of any such action, it shall not be liable to the                   Agency for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred                   on the Agency's behalf absent MICOA's advance approval of such                   expenses.\n\n         4.       Neither party shall, except at its own risk and expense,                   voluntarily assume any liability, make any payment or incur                   any expense without the prior written consent of the other.\n\nH.       POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES\n\n         1.       Other Programs. Agency and MICOA agree that Agency may be                   offered the opportunity to support MICOA's workers'                   compensation, and its other nonphysician professional                   liability or product programs in Nevada when MICOA proceeds                   with related marketing plans. Such plans may also include                   Agency's involvement in sales of MICOA commercial and personal                   products. Appropriate agreements must be negotiated separately                   from this agreement for each such product, and for each such                   territory, including but not limited to Nevada.\n\n         2.       Territory. Agency and MICOA further agree to consider, subject                   to successful negotiation of appropriate agreements separate                   from this agreement, expansion of Agencies' sales territories                   for MICOA beyond Nevada.\n\nI.       MISCELLANEOUS\n\n         1.       Amendment. This agreement may be amended only in writing by                   mutual agreement of the Agency and MICOA, except that MICOA's                   name herein shall be deemed changed automatically for purposes                   of this agreement without written amendment upon approval of                   any such change by MICOA's domiciliary regulator.\n\n         2.       Non Waiver. Any failure by MICOA to insist upon compliance                   with any provisions of this Agreement or of the rules and                   regulations of MICOA shall not be construed as or constitute a                   waiver of them by MICOA.\n\n                                      -5-\n\n         3.       Integrated Agreement. This Agreement and its attachments as                   modified from time to time supersedes and replaces as of its                   effective date, all previous agreements, if any, between MICOA                   and the Agency. There are other agreements between MICOA and                   the Agency's parent corporation, SC&W, which are not                   superceded.\n\n         4. &bbsp;     Independent Contractor. The Agency is an independent insurance                   Agency and independent contractor, and not an employee,                   manager, officer or owner of MICOA.\n\n         5.       Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be interpreted under the                   laws of the State of Nevada. Any provisions of this Agreement                   or any amendments to the Agreement that are or become in                   conflict with any applicable statutes or regulations shall be                   deemed to be amended to conform to those statutes or                   regulations.\n\n         6.       Counterparts. This Agreement and any Exhibits which require                   signatures may be executed in counterparts which shall\n\n\n\n\n\n                  together be regarded as binding upon the Parties.\n\n         7.       Authority. The persons signing below represent and warrant                   that they are duly authorized representatives of the                   respective Parties, fully willing and able to execute this                   Agreement.\n\n         8.       Assignment. MICOA may assign this Agreement to its parent,                   affiliate, or subsidiary corporations who are licensed                   insurers upon written notice to Agency. Agency may not assign                   this Agreement without the written permission of MICOA or its                   successors or assigns.\n\n         9.       Resolution of Disputes. In the event of any dispute arising                   out of this Agreement, MICOA and Agency agree to submit such                   dispute to arbitration as follows:\n\n                  a.       There shall be three arbitrators; one shall be                            selected by the Agency, one shall be selected by                            MICOA, and a third shall be selected by those two                            arbitrators. If the two arbitrators cannot agree on                            the selection of a third, American Arbitration                            Association's regional office closest to Agency's                            main office shall be requested to appoint the third                            arbitrator.\n\n                  b.       The determination of the arbitrators shall be final                            and binding upon the Agency and MICOA.\n\n                  c.       Neither MICOA nor the Agency shall be entitled to                            punitive and/or exemplary damages.\n\n                                      -6-\n\n                  d.       The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with                            the procedures of the above referenced regional                            office of the American Arbitration Association. The                            Agency and MICOA shall pay the cost of their                            arbitrator and share equally in the expense of the                            third arbitrator.\n\n                  e.       Either Party, may where permitted by the law of                            Nevada, enter judgment upon the arbitrators' award.\n\n         10.      Year 2000 Compliance. Agency must at times assure that any of                   its computers, data processing systems, software components,                   and network arrangements use for MICOA business completely and                   accurately, present, produce, store and calculate all dates                   after December 31, 1999; and that they will not produce                   abnormally ending or incorrect results involving such dates as                   used in any forward or regression data based functions. All                   such items must yield date-related functionalities and date                   fields which accurately indicate the century and millennium                   and correctly perform all calculations involving a four digit                   year field.\n\nSigned and effective this 25th day of May, 1999.\n\n                                         AGENCY\n\n                                         By:  /s/ Terrence L.

Hagadorn East Lansing, MI 48823\n\nRE:      NEVADA DEPARTMENT          PROJECT MEMORANDUM\n\nDear Terry:\n\nIn response to MICOA's request to develop a complete insurance distribution system for Nevada, including physicians professional liability and personal and commercial insurance by July 1999, Stratton, Cheeseman & Walsh, Inc. (SC&W) has spent and will continue to spend a substantial amount of time and money. In recognition that these expenditures will directly benefit MICOA, SC&W and MICOA agree to the following:\n\n-    During the first two years of developing the Nevada distribution system, a      portion of the start up costs will be shared. Subject to compliance with a      detailed budget developed by SC&W and MICOA, these reimbursable costs shall      include:\n\n     -    Salaries and benefits for SCW-Nevada, Inc. employees and agents.\n\n     -    20% of your total personal benefits and salary, and 100% of your           personal travel expenses incurred with respect to the Nevada office,           which respective percentages are intended to recognize your personal           support of MICOA's Nevada initiative.\n\n     -    Legal expenses directly attributable to the Nevada initiative.\n\n     -    Nevada office set up.\n\n     -    Consultant's expenses paid by SC&W in direct support of the           initiative.\n\n     -    The above costs are to be designated and itemized in the preapproved           budget and reimbursed by MICOA at 100% for the first full year of           development and 50% for the second year. It is agreed that the first           year began effective October 1, 1997.\n\n-    All other costs attributable to the normal operation of the Nevada      insurance agency site are the sole responsibility of SC&W.\n\n-    After the first two years (i.e. after October 1, 1999) all expenses will      be borne by SC&W and those amounts paid to SC&W during the first two years      shall be repaid. Repayment shall be through reduction of commissions due      SC&W by 0.5% or if\n\n                                      -7-\n\n     SC&W exceeds $10.0 million in premium revenues by offset in the event any      money is owed the Agency by MICOA. Such reduction or offset shall occur for      so long as necessary to repay amounts reimbursed by MICOA during the      two-year period of development; but in no event will repayment be collected      for a period of greater than ten years. Any unpaid amounts at the end of      ten years shall be forgiven by MICOA.\n\n-    Nevada rent expenses will be shared on a 50/50 basis between MICOA and      SC&W.\n\n-    In order to allow SC&W to expand the distribution system in Nevada with      select and controlled subagents, an exclusive agency agreement will be      negotiated which will spell out the terms and conditions of the      relationship. A commission rate of 12% will be paid for both new and      renewal physicians liability business. Other commission rates will be      determined as products become available. This Agency Agreement should be      finalized by April 30, 1999.\n\n-    MICOA may pay future payments advanced pursuant to this letter on a monthly      basis, unless doing so would be impractical, in which case another periodic      form of&bbsp;payment will be arranged. Amounts owed for past time periods will      be paid as follows: one-third by March 25, 1999; one-third by May 1, 1999;      and one-third by June 1, 1999. All other amounts owed under this Project      Memorandum to be paid by October 1, 1999.\n\nSC&W's responsibilities, under this Project Memorandum, will include assisting MICOA with market assessment, distribution, and sales integration into Nevada. SC&W agrees not to serve in a strategic marketing capacity for another insurer\n\n\n\n\n\nin Nevada while it is providing such services for MICOA or for a period of one year thereafter.\n\nTerry, please countersign and return this letter to indicate your acceptance.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMUTUAL INSURANCE CORPORATION OF AMERICA\n\n/s/ Thomas C.

Kelly             David A. Smith\n\nGentlemen:\n\n     The undersigned is a shareholder of Gulf South Medical Supply, Inc. (\"GSMS\"), a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and will become a shareholder of Physician Sales & Service, Inc. (\"PSS\"), a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Florida, pursuant to the transactions described in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 14, 1997 (the \"Agreement\"), by and among PSS, PSS Merger Corp. (\"Merger Corp.\") and GSMS.  Under the terms of the Agreement, Merger Corp. will be merged into and with GSMS (the \"Merger\"), and the shares of the $.01 par value common stock of GSMS (\"GSMS Common Stock\") will be converted into and exchanged for shares of the $.01 par value common stock of PSS (\"PSS Common Stock\").  This Affiliate Agreement represents an agreement between the undersigned and PSS regarding certain rights and obligations of the undersigned in connection with the shares of PSS to be received by the undersigned as a result of the Merger.\n\n     In consideration of the Merger and the mutual covenants contained herein, the undersigned and PSS hereby agree as follows:\n\n     1.  Affiliate Status.  The undersigned understands and agrees that as to          ----------------                                                     GSMS he is an \"affiliate\" under Rule 145(c) as defined in Rule 405 of the Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\"1933 Act\"), and the undersigned anticipates that he will be such an \"affiliate\" at the time of the Merger.\n\n     2.  Initial Restriction on Disposition.  The undersigned agrees that he          ----------------------------------                                  will not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of his interests in, or reduce his risk relative to, any of the shares of PSS Common Stock into which his shares of GSMS Common Stock are converted upon consummation of the Merger until such time as PSS notifies the undersigned that the requirements of SEC Accounting Series Release Nos. 130 and 135 (\"ASR 130 and 135\") have been met. The undersigned understands that ASR 130 and 135 relate to publication of financial results of post-Merger combined operations of PSS and GSMS. PSS agrees that it will publish such results as promptly as practicable following the Merger in the sole discretion of PSS, but in any event within 45 days after the end of the first fiscal quarter of PSS containing the required period of post-Merger combined operations and that it will notify the undersigned promptly following such publication.\n\n     3.  Covenants and Warranties of Undersigned.  The undersigned represents,          ---------------------------------------                               warrants and agrees that:\n\n     (a) The PSS Common Stock received by the undersigned as a result of the    Merger will be taken for his own account and not for others, directly or    indirectly, in whole or in part.\n\n     (b) PSS has informed the undersigned that any distribution by the    undersigned of PSS Common Stock has not been registered under the 1933 Act    and that shares of PSS Common Stock received pursuant to the Merger can only    be sold by the undersigned (1) following registration under the 1933 Act, or    (2) in conformity with the volume and other requirements of Rule 145(d)    promulgated by the SEC as the same now exist or may hereafter be amended, or    (3) to the extent some other exemption from registration under the 1933 Act    might be available.  The undersigned understands that PSS is under no                         ------------------------------------------------    obligation to file a registration statement with the SEC covering the    ---------------------------------------------------------------------    disposition of the undersigned's shares of PSS Common    -----------------------------------------------------\n\n     Stock or to take any other action necessary to make compliance with an    ----------------------------------------------------------------------    exemption from such registration available.    ------------------------------------------\n\n     (c) During the 30 days immediately preceding the Effective Time of the    Merger, the undersigned has not sold, transfered, or otherwise disposed of    his interests in, or reduced his risk relative to, any of the shares of GSMS    Common Stock beneficially owned by the undersigned as of the record date for    determination of shareholders entitled to vote at the Shareholders' Meeting    of GSMS held to approve the Merger.\n\n     (d) The undersigned is aware that PSS intends to treat the Merger as a tax-    free reorganization under Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code (\"Code\")\n\n\n\n\n\n   for federal income tax purposes.  The undersigned agrees to treat the    transaction in the same manner as PSS for federal income tax purposes.  The    undersigned acknowledges that Section 1.368-1(b) of the Income Tax    Regulations requires \"continuity of interest\" in order for the Merger to be    treated as tax-free under Section 368 of the Code. This requirement is    satisfied if, taking into account those GSMS shareholders who receive cash in    exchange for their stock, who receive cash in lieu of fractional shares, or    who dissent from the Merger, there is no plan or intention on the part of the    GSMS shareholders to sell or otherwise dispose of the PSS Common Stock to be    received in the Merger that will reduce such shareholders' ownership to a    number of shares having, in the aggregate, a value at the time of the Merger    of less than 50% of the total fair market value of the GSMS Common Stock    outstanding immediately prior to the Merger. The undersigned has no    prearrangement, plan or intention to sell or otherwise dispose of an amount    of his PSS Common Stock to be received in the Merger which would cause the    foregoing requirement not to be satisfied.\n\n     4.  Restrictions on Transfer.  The undersigned understands and agrees that          ------------------------                                               stop transfer instructions with respect to the shares of PSS Common Stock received by the undersigned pursuant to the Merger will be given to PSS's transfer agent and that there will be placed on the certificates for such shares, or shares issued in substitution thereof, a legend stating in substance:\n\n   \"The shares represented by this certificate were issued pursuant to a    business combination which is accounted for as a \"pooling of interests\" and    may not be sold, nor may the owner thereof reduce his risks relative thereto    in any way, until such time as PSS, Inc. (\"PSS\") has published the financial    results covering at least 30 days of combined operations after the effective    date of the merger through which the business combination was effected.  In    addition, the shares represented by this certificate may not be sold,    transferred or otherwise disposed of except or unless (1) covered by an    effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as    amended, (2) in accordance with (i) Rule 145(d) (in the case of shares issued    to an individual who is not an affiliate of PSS) or (ii) Rule 144 (in the                            ---                                                  case of shares issued to an individual who is an affiliate of PSS) of the    Rules and Regulations of such Act, or (3) in accordance with a legal opinion    satisfactory to counsel for PSS that such sale or transfer is otherwise    exempt from the registration requirements of such Act.\"\n\nSuch legend will also be placed on any certificate representing PSS securities issued subsequent to the original issuance of the PSS Common Stock pursuant to the Merger as a result of any transfer of such shares or any stock dividend, stock split, or other recapitalization as long as the PSS Common Stock issued to the undersigned pursuant to the Merger has not been transferred in such manner to justify the removal of the legend therefrom.  Upon the request of the undersigned, PSS shall cause the certificates representing the shares of PSS Common Stock issued to the undersigned in connection with the Merger to be reissued free of any legend relating to restrictions on transfer by virtue of ASR 130 and 135 as soon as practicable after the requirements of ASR 130 and 135 have been met.  In addition, if the provisions of Rules 144 and 145 are amended to eliminate restrictions applicable to the PSS Common Stock received by the undersigned pursuant to the Merger, or at the expiration of the restrictive period set forth in Rule 145(d), PSS, upon the request of the undersigned, will cause the certificates representing the shares of PSS Common Stock issued to the undersigned in connection with the Merger to be reissued free of any legend relating to the restrictions set forth in Rules 144 and 145(d) upon receipt by PSS of an opinion of its counsel to the effect that such legend may be removed.\n\n                                     - 2 -\n\n       5.  Understanding of Restrictions on Dispositions.  The undersigned has          ---------------------------------------------                       carefully read the Agreement and this Affiliate Agreement and discussed their requirements and impact upon his ability to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of the shares of PSS Common Stock received by the undersigned, to the extent he believes necessary, with his counsel or counsel for GSMS.\n\n     6.  Filing of Reports by PSS.  PSS agrees, for a period of three years          ------------------------                                           after the effective date of the Merger, to file on a timely basis all reports required to be filed by it pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, so that the public information provisions of Rule 145(d) promulgated by the SEC as the same are presently in effect will be available to the undersigned in the event the undersigned desires to transfer any shares of PSS Common Stock issued to the undersigned pursuant to the Merger.\n\n     7.  Transfer Under Rule 145(d).  If the undersigned desires to sell or          --------------------------                                         otherwise transfer the shares of PSS Common Stock received by him in connection with the Merger at any time during the restrictive period set forth in Rule 145(d), the undersigned will provide the necessary representation letter to the transfer agent for PSS Common Stock together with such additional information as the transfer agent may reasonably request.  If PSS's counsel concludes that such proposed sale or transfer complies with the requirements of Rule 145(d), PSS shall cause such counsel to provide such opinions as may be necessary to PSS's Transfer Agent so that the undersigned may complete the proposed sale or transfer.\n\n     8.  Acknowledgments.  The undersigned recognizes and agrees that the          ---------------                                                  foregoing provisions also apply to all shares of the capital stock of GSMS and PSS that are deemed to be beneficially owned by the undersigned pursuant to applicable federal securities laws, which the undersigned agrees may include,\n\n\n\n\n\nwithout limitation, shares owned or held in the name of (i) the undersigned's spouse, (ii) any relative of the undersigned or of the undersigned's spouse who has the same home as the undersigned, (iii) any trust or estate in which the undersigned, the undersigned's spouse, and any such relative collectively own at least a 10% beneficial interest or of which any of the foregoing serves as trustee, executor, or in any similar capacity, and (iv) any corporation or other organization in which the undersigned, the undersigned's spouse and any such relative collectively own at least 10% of any class of equity securities or of the equity interest.  The undersigned further recognizes that, in the event that the undersigned is a director or officer of PSS or becomes a director or officer of PSS upon consummation of the Merger, among other things, any sale of PSS Common Stock by the undersigned within a period of less than six months following the effective time of the Merger may subject the undersigned to liability pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\n     9.  Miscellaneous.  This Affiliate Agreement is the complete agreement          -------------                                                      between PSS and the undersigned concerning the subject matter hereof.  Any notice required to be sent to any party hereunder shall be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, using the addresses set forth herein or such other address as shall be furnished in writing by the parties.

Bryn Mawr Avenue, Suite 500N, Chicago, IL 60631 (\"Supplier\" or \"Fonterra\") (each a \"Party\", collectively \"Parties\").\n\nWHEREAS PNC produces, distributes, markets and sells products including ready to drink protein shakes and beverages, powdered protein shakes, nutrition bars, and dietary supplements (the \"Finished Products\"); and\n\nWHEREAS Supplier produces raw materials including protein powders used by PNC to produce at least some of the Finished Products;\n\nNOW THEREFORE in consideration of their respective rights and obligations as set forth in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the adequacy and receipt of which are acknowledged, PNC and Supplier agree as follows:\n\n1 Supply of Ingredients\n\n1.1 Supplier will provide such materials to PNC or its Third Party Manufacturers (\"TPMs\") as are specified in any Master Purchase Commitment or any other purchase orders that the Parties may execute from time to time during the term of this Agreement (\"Ingredients\"). Ingredients will be produced at Supplier's facilities listed in a Master Purchase Commitment, or any other of Supplier's facilities approved in advance, in writing by PNC.\n\n1.2 PNC or its TPMs will place specific orders for Ingredients from Supplier by issuing a purchase order that specifies, at minimum, the item, quantities, price, delivery dates, and delivery and payment terms (each a \"Purchase Order\").\n\n1.3 PNC and Supplier may enter certain Master Purchase Commitments from time to time during the Term of this Master Supply Agreement. Such Master Purchase Commitments and any Purchase Orders issued against such Commitments shall be subject exclusively to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In the event the terms of any Master Purchase Commitment conflicts with the terms of this Agreement, the terms of the Master Purchase Commitment shall control.\n\n1.4 Supplier will receive Purchase Orders by telephone, USPS, overnight courier, email, and fax transmission, Monday through Friday except on state or nationally recognized bank holidays. Purchase Orders not received by 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time are considered to be received on the following\n\nPage 1\n\n\n\n\n\nbusiness day. Supplier will confirm or reject Purchase Orders within [***] of receipt of the Purchase Order. Orders not rejected in writing within such time will be deemed confirmed and accepted by Supplier. Each Purchase Order issued by PNC or its TPMs and accepted by Supplier shall be governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Additional terms included in acknowledgments, standard terms and conditions, or any other documents or communications exchanged by the Parties in connection with the sale or purchase of any Ingredients shall be void and of no force or effect. The Parties may only modify, add to or amend any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement by a writing signed by authorized representatives of both Parties.\n\n1.5 Supplier represents and warrants that at the time and date of delivery, the Ingredients will comply with all specifications (\"Specifications\"), a copy of which will be attached to the relevant Master Purchase Commitment or Purchase Order accordingly. A Specification may be updated from time to time by PNC in its sole discretion, provided PNC provides Supplier with reasonable prior notice on any updates (\"Change Notification\"). Within [***] from receipt of the Change Notification, Supplier will either: (1) accept the Specification change at the current price and terms; or (2) submit to PNC a proposal (\"Proposal\") setting forth the conditions of acceptance that may include a change in price and/or other terms, including documentation to support same. Within [***] the Parties will discuss the Proposal in good faith and exercise their best efforts to agree on the appropriate adjustment if any. PNC will not issue any Purchase Orders, nor be required to issue any Purchase Orders to Supplier until PNC and Supplier have agreed on required Ingredient Specifications and any associated price and/or term adjustment. In the event the Parties fail to agree on required Ingredient Specifications or price and/or term adjustments despite their best good faith efforts, neither Party will have any further obligation with regard to purchase or supply of those Ingredients under any Master Purchase Commitments except that PNC shall take and pay for [***] of Ingredient inventory manufactured according to the then-current Specification.\n\n1.6 Supplier will provide a Certificate of Analysis (\"COA\") completed in accordance with the Specifications with any shipment of Ingredients.\n\n1.7 INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\n1.8 This Agreement is nonexclusive and sets forth the terms and conditions under which the Parties will supply and purchase Ingredients from the other Party.

[***] Metric targets will be established by PNC and agreed by Fonterra and updated as needed. The ultimate goal is zero defects for quality and administrative compliance issues.\n\n1.10 Supplier agrees to make a good faith effort to provide Advance Ship Notices (\"ASN\") with bar-coded pallet labels; Invoices, Purchase Orders and other business transactions, as may be advised by PNC, for each Ingredient shipment. Supplier will provide, itself or through a third-party provider, the information via Electronic Data Interface (\"EDI\") if and as requested by PNC. The technical specifications for all required EDI transactions will be provided by PNC.\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Quality and Food Safety\n\n2.1 For the purposes set forth in Section 303(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the \"Act\"), Supplier guarantees to PNC that as of the time and date of delivery, all Ingredients will not be adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the Act, nor will any Ingredients constitute an article that may not, under the provisions of Sections 404 and 505 of the Act, be introduced into interstate commerce. The Supplier further guarantees that as of the time and date of delivery, all of the Ingredients will be in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, requirements and programs including those administered by the Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\"), the United States Department of Agriculture (the \"USDA\") and any state or local food or drug laws then in effect. This guarantee specifically includes Proposition 65 (California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act), and Supplier hereby certifies that the Ingredients will not contain any non-naturally occurring chemicals subject to Proposition 65 or that any such chemicals pose \"no significant risk\" or cause \"no observable effect\" as set forth in the California Health and Safety Code, 22 CCR \u00a7\u00a7 12701 et seq. and 22 CCR \u00a7\u00a7 12801 et seq., as amended. Supplier shall comply with all applicable regulatory requirements for determining and documenting that all Ingredients are at or below no significant risk levels and no observable effect levels, as applicable.\n\n2.2 Supplier shall develop and maintain a food safety/food defense program as required under the Food Safety Modernization Act 21 USC \u00a7301 et seq and shall submit a copy of such plan (and any changes thereto) to PNC upon PNC's request. Supplier will conduct [***] third-party food safety/food defense audits (the \"Audits\") in compliance with, and consistent with, relevant audit schemes approved by the Global Food Safety Initiatives, AIB International, Silliker, or GMA SAFE. Supplier will submit summaries of audit reports to PNC's Quality Manager at [***] upon request. Failure to comply with the requirements of this Section 2.2 will constitute a material breach of this Agreement.\n\n2.3 Supplier will notify PNC immediately, by person-to-person voice communication or equivalent means, if any of the Ingredients contain, or are reasonably suspected to contain, material hazardous to human health, including but not limited to, chemical, physical or biological hazards.\n\n2.4 PNC shall notify Supplier in writing if it determines any Ingredient fails to meet the Specifications.

All payments hereunder shall be payable in U.S. Dollars. All payments owed under this Agreement shall be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to a bank and account designated in writing by Xencor, unless otherwise specified in writing by Xencor.\n\n8.3 Taxes.\n\n8.3.1 The Parties acknowledge and agree that it is their mutual objective and intent to minimize, to the extent feasible, taxes payable with respect to their collaborative efforts under this Agreement to cooperate and coordinate with each other to achieve such objective.

Each Party shall cooperate with the other Party in any way reasonably requested by the other Party to minimize the withholding tax implications of any such assignment or delegation.\n\n8.3.3 Aimmune shall be responsible for all Value Added Taxes (\"VAT\"), if any, attributable to transactions contemplated by this Agreement without any offset or reimbursement from Xencor.

Within [***] ([***]) days after delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If a Party believes that a Claim presented to it for indemnification is one as to which the Party seeking indemnification is not entitled to indemnification under, as applicable, Section 11.1 or Section 11.2, it shall so notify the Party seeking indemnification.\n\n11.3.2 If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of such Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at its own expense; provided, that if the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, based on advice from counsel, that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests with respect to such Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party solely in connection therewith.\n\n11.3.3 The Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party advised of the status of such Claim and the defense thereof and shall consider recommendations made by the Indemnified Party with respect thereto. 35\n\nSource: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3.4 The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of such Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, OR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF ANY NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Aimmune shall provide Xencor with written notice at least [***] ([***]) days prior to the cancellation, nonrenewal or material change in such insurance or self-insurance which materially adversely affects the rights of Xencor hereunder.\n\nARTICLE 12 CONFIDENTIALITY\n\n12.1 Confidential Information.\n\n12.1.1 The Parties agree that during the Term, and for a period of [***] ([***]) years thereafter, a Party receiving Confidential Information of the other Party will (X) maintain in confidence such Confidential Information to the same extent such Party maintains its own proprietary information of similar kind and value, and, in any event, no less than a reasonable standard of care, (Y) not disclose such Confidential Information to any Third Party without the prior written consent of the other Party, except as otherwise expressly permitted below, and (Z) not use such Confidential Information for any purpose except those permitted by this Agreement. 36\n\nSource: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nAs used herein, \"Confidential Information\" means all Know-How and other information and materials received by either Party from the other Party or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement.

Where reasonably possible, the receiving Party shall notify the disclosing Party of the receiving Party's intent to make such disclosure of Confidential Information pursuant to the preceding sentence sufficiently prior to making such disclosure so as to allow the disclosing Party adequate time to take whatever action the disclosing Party may deem to be appropriate to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information.\n\n12.1.3 Except as set forth above, each Party agrees that it shall provide or permit access to Confidential Information of the other Party only to (i) the receiving Party's attorneys, independent accountants and financial advisors for the sole purpose of enabling such attorneys, independent accountants and financial advisors to provide advice to the receiving Party and (ii) the receiving Party's Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors, actual or potential acquirers and permitted subcontractors, sublicensees and subdistributors, and to the directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors and permitted subcontractors, actual or potential acquirers, sublicensees and subdistributors of such Affiliates, who have a need to know such Confidential Information to assist the receiving Party with the 37\n\nSource: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nactivities contemplated or required of it by this Agreement; provided that in each case the Person to whom Confidential Information is being disclosed is subject to obligations of confidentiality and non-use with respect to such Confidential Information substantially similar to the obligations of confidentiality and nonuse of the receiving Party pursuant to this Section 12.1; and provided further, that each Party shall remain responsible for any failure by its attorneys, independent accountants and financial advisors, Affiliates, and its and its Affiliates' respective directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors, actual or potential acquirers and permitted subcontractors, sublicensees and subdistributors, to treat such Confidential Information as required under this Section 12.1.\n\nFor clarity, either Party may disclose without any limitation such Party's U.S. federal income tax treatment and the U.S. federal income tax structure of the transactions relating to such Party that are based on or derived from this Agreement, as well as all materials of any kind (including opinions, other tax analyses, or a complete copy of this Agreement and any amendments thereto) relating to such tax treatment or tax structure, except to the extent that nondisclosure of such matters is reasonably necessary in order to comply with applicable securities laws.\n\n12.1.4 Each Party acknowledges that a Party in breach of any of its obligations under this Section 12.1 shall cause the non-breaching Party irreparable harm, for which monetary damages will be an inadequate remedy. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement in the event of any such breach, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy available to it under this Agreement, at law or in equity, to injunctive relief, including an accounting for profits, specific performance of the terms hereof and other equitable relief for such breach, without the posting of bond or other security.\n\n12.2 Publicity.

Subject to the foregoing, any press releases or other public statements or disclosures regarding the subject matter of this Agreement shall be subject to the express prior written consent of each of the Parties; provided that a disclosure shall be permitted without the other Party's consent to the extent that it does not contain information beyond that included in a prior disclosure approved in writing by both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing any disclosure which is required by Applicable Law or the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or any securities exchange, as reasonably advised by the disclosing Party's counsel, may be made without the prior consent of the other Party, although, prior to any such legally required disclosure by a Party, such Party shall use reasonable efforts where practicable to give the other Party reasonable notice and an opportunity to comment on the proposed disclosure.\n\n12.3 Securities Filings.

Except for disclosures permitted under this Agreement, if Xencor, its Affiliates, or its employee(s) or consultant(s) wishes to make a publication or presentation specific to the Product or which otherwise may reasonably contain Know-How, or other intellectual property, of Aimmune, Xencor must receive written approval, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, from Aimmune at least [***] ([***]) days prior to submission for publication or presentation.

Each Party shall have a response plan in place for any disclosure of Confidential Information that is not authorized or otherwise permitted under this Agreement. Such plan shall include considerations of, among other things, notification, remediation and retrieval. In the event that a Party becomes aware of an unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information, then such Party shall notify the other Party promptly in writing.\n\n12.7 Prior CDA. As of the Effective Date, the terms of this ARTICLE 12 shall supersede any prior non-disclosure, secrecy or confidentiality agreement between the Parties (or their Affiliates) dealing with the subject of this Agreement, including the Confidentiality Agreement between the Parties dated [***].

The Breaching Party shall have sixty (60) days (thirty (30) days in the event of non-payment) after written notice thereof was provided to the Breaching Party by the non-breaching Party to remedy such default. Unless the Breaching Party has cured any such breach or default prior to the expiration of such sixty (60) day period (thirty (30) day period for non-payment), such termination shall become effective upon receipt of the written notice of termination by the Breaching Party to be given within ten (10) days of the end of such sixty (60) day period (thirty (30) day period for non-payment).

(Nasdaq: AIMT), a biopharmaceutical company developing treatments for potentially life-threatening food allergies, today announced it has obtained an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize the investigational humanized monoclonal antibody XmAb\u00ae7195 from Xencor, Inc.\n\nXmAb7195, which has been renamed AIMab7195, was originally developed by Xencor for the treatment of allergic asthma. It uses three distinct mechanisms of action to reduce blood serum IgE and suppress IgE-producing cells. Aimmune initially plans to develop AIMab7195 as an adjunctive treatment with select Characterized Oral Desensitized ImmunoTherapy (CODIT\u2122) programs, including PALFORZIA\u2122 , to explore treatment outcomes in patients with food allergies.\n\n\"As we look to the future of food allergy treatments, we are excited to explore the potential of oral immunotherapy to achieve greater levels of desensitization - and perhaps even remission - when combined with adjunctive biologics that target immune pathways,\" said Jayson Dallas, M.D., President and CEO of Aimmune. \"In-licensing AIMab7195 demonstrates our commitment to enriching our pipeline and strengthening Aimmune's global leadership in the evolving therapeutic landscape of food allergy treatments.\"\n\n\"Aimmune's focus, clinical success and regulatory expertise in food allergy demonstrate their capability to advance AIMab7195 with highly complementary CODIT pipeline programs to create new options for people living with food allergy,\" said Bassil Dahiyat, Ph.D., President and CEO of Xencor. \"AIMab7195 is designed to reduce levels of IgE, a key mediator of allergic response, and there is strong scientific rationale that this reduction would synergize with the activity of desensitization therapies.\"\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Aimmune will make an upfront payment to Xencor of $5 million in cash and $5 million in equity, equivalent to 156,238 newly issued shares of Aimmune common stock at $32.0025/share. Xencor also is eligible to receive up to $385 million based on the achievement of certain clinical development, regulatory and commercialization milestones \u2014 beginning with the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial \u2014 and is eligible to receive a high single-digit to mid-teen percentage of royalties upon commercialization of AIMab7195. Aimmune will be solely responsible for costs related to the development of AIMab7195 and plans to provide a development plan in the coming months.\n\nAbout AIMab7195 (formerly XmAb\u00ae7195)\n\nAIMab7195 is an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody with enhanced binding to the Fc gamma receptor IIb (FcyRIIb). IgE recognizes and interacts with allergens and, as a result, can activate immune cells, such as mast cells and basophils, that drive an allergic response\n\nSource: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nin patients. AIMab7195 is designed to clear IgE rapidly from circulation, to prevent the production of IgE by preventing the activation of IgE-positive B cells, and to block IgE from interacting with its receptor on immune cells. AIMab7195 has been evaluated in two Phase 1 studies that enrolled more than 100 healthy volunteers and patients with allergy and atopic disease.\n\nAbout Aimmune\n\nAimmune Therapeutics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company that aspires to become the global leader in developing curative therapies and solutions for patients with food allergies. With a mission to improve the lives of people with food allergies, Aimmune is developing and commercializing oral treatments for potentially life-threatening food allergies. The Company's Characterized Oral Desensitization ImmunoTherapy (CODIT\u2122) approach is intended to provide meaningful levels of protection against allergic reactions resulting from accidental exposure to food allergens by desensitizing patients with defined, precise amounts of key allergens. Aimmune has one FDA-approved medicine for peanut allergy and other investigational therapies in development to treat other food allergies.

If any delay in meeting the System Completion Date is in any way due             to the Publishers' fault, HealthGate will nevertheless, if the             Publishers so requests, continue with the work on the Project with a             view to completing it as soon as reasonably possible in the             circumstances, and the Development Timetable will be adjusted             accordingly.\n\n6.    Project Management\n\n      6.1.  HealthGate and the Publishers shall each designate the name,             address, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address of a             Project Manager and a Deputy Project Manager. The Project Managers             shall be responsible for arranging all meetings, visits, and             consultations between the parties, and for the transmission and             receipt of technical information between the parties. The parties'             initial Project Manager and Deputy Project Manager is set forth on             the Third Schedule hereto.\n\n      6.2.  If HealthGate has reason to believe that any estimate of any time is             likely to be exceeded or that it is likely that the Development             Timetable will not be complied with, HealthGate will immediately             inform the Publishers' Project Manager by written notice.\n\n                                       5\n\n7.    Content\n\n      The Publishers, at their cost and expense, shall make available the       Content in loadable electronic format to HealthGate as specified in the       Specification. HealthGate shall remotely load the Content into a staging       area.\n\n8.    Procurement of Hardware\n\n      HealthGate shall maintain the Site on HealthGate's web server and/or other       servers through the term of this Agreement insofar as it relates to the       Services. HealthGate shall acquire and maintain all necessary equipment       and hardware (collectively the \"Hardware\") for Site. The Hardware shall be       capable of storing the Content, including future issues of the Journals       within the Content. HealthGate shall replace and upgrade such Hardware to       satisfy the requirements of the Specification. The Hardware for the Site       shall include redundancy so that the Site may remain operational despite       an equipment failure. The Hardware shall be located at HealthGate's       computer facilities in Malden, Massachusetts. The Hardware may be       relocated only with Publishers' written consent, which consent shall not       be unreasonably withheld. HealthGate, at its cost and expense, shall       maintain adequate access via telecommunications to the Site at service\n\n\n\n\n\n      levels that shall be maintained at the same extent as HealthGate provides       to its own users.\n\n9.    Testing, Acceptance and Delivery\n\n      9.1.  Upon completion of the Development Work HealthGate and the             Publishers shall run acceptance tests to assure compliance with the             Specification. Load testing will be conducted at HealthGate. Such             period of acceptance testing shall not exceed 2 weeks from date of             delivery for testing.\n\n      9.2.  Upon passing the acceptance tests, the System shall be deemed             Accepted\n\n      9.3.  Upon Acceptance as provided in Clause 9.2 HealthGate shall deliver             into escrow the source code, source listings and information for the             Proprietary Software included in the System in accordance with the             terms of the Escrow Agreement.\n\n      9.4.  In the event that the system fails to pass any of the prescribed             acceptance tests or fails to satisfy the Publishers' requirements,             the Publishers shall afford HealthGate the opportunity of             rectifying, replacing and retesting the System. In the event that             the System or any part thereof again fails to be accepted, such             acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld, or to satisfy the             Publishers' requirements of which the Publishers shall be the sole             judge, the Publishers shall (as time is of the essence of this             Agreement) be entitled, in addition to any other rights it may have             under this Agreement or in law, to have HealthGate remove the             Content from the System (in whole or in part as the Publishers so\n\n                                       6\n\n            instructs) and HealthGate shall be liable to refund forthwith any             moneys paid by the Publishers for such rejected System or part             thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon acceptance of System             launch, as noted in Clause 19.2.4, HealthGate shall be entitled to             retain all monies paid by Publishers to this point.\n\n            In such circumstances HealthGate shall be entitled to retain the             first $250,000 paid by the Publishers to develop the Specification.\n\n10.   Licence\n\n      10.1. Proprietary Software\n\n            HealthGate hereby grants to the Publishers a non-exclusive             non-transferable licence to use the Proprietary Software for the             purposes of this Agreement\n\n            Save in relation to the Publishers' logos, trademarks, and content,             HealthGate may use and/or licence the Proprietary Software for             itself or for others without any compensation or liability to the             Publishers.\n\n            All Proprietary Software and Source Code remain the property of             HealthGate. Publishers may not use either Proprietary Software or             Source Code held in escrow to develop a product that competes with             those services offered by HealthGate. HealthGate, in its sole             discretion, retains the right to determine if Publishers are             utilizing either the Proprietary Software or Source Code in             violation of this Agreement.\n\n      10.2. Option for Licence\n\n            10.2.1. On termination of the provision of the Services by                     HealthGate to the Publishers for whatever reason, HealthGate                     shall at the Publishers' option:\n\n                          (i) grant to the Publishers a non-exclusive                     non-transferable licence to use the Proprietary Software for                     the purposes of using, developing, enhancing and maintaining                     the Site and carrying out any or all of the activities                     previously carried out by HealthGate or on its behalf under                     this Agreement\n\n                          (ii) exercise best endeavours to grant to the                     Publishers a non-exclusive non-transferable licence to use                     the Third Party Software for the Site when and to the extent                     requested by the Publishers.\n\n            10.2.2. The annual fee for the licence in Clause 10.2.1 for the                     Software, to include the Proprietary Software and the Third                     Party Software, shall be $150,000 per annum, including                     standard upgrades and maintenance, provided that if                     HealthGate is not able to grant a licence of the Third Party                     Software, then the Publishers shall be at liberty to licence                     the Third Party Software from its owners and/or licensors                     direct, and/or to\n\n                                       7\n\n\n\n\n\n                    license alternative software, and shall deduct the fees for                     such licences from the $150,000 per annum for the Software.\n\n            10.2.3. The Publishers shall have the right to terminate the licence                     referred to in Clause 10.2.1 by giving three months' notice                     in writing to HealthGate.\n\n11.

The Service Levels will be subject to review at any time by             agreement between the Project Managers and in any event will be             formally reviewed every 12 months during the term of this Agreement.\n\n      12.3. HealthGate will provide usage statistics relating to the Services as             described in the specification on a monthly basis, or such other             reasonable intervals as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties             from time to time.\n\n      12.4. HealthGate will perform the Services and meet the Specifications and             Service Levels set forth and referred to in this Agreement.

Permitted Users, Pricing and Subscription Information\n\n      13.1. The Publishers shall have sole authority concerning determining             access to the Site. Except for the fees payable to HealthGate             described in Clause 14 hereof (document delivery), the Publishers             shall retain the sole and exclusive right to determine the prices             and fees payable and other terms and conditions applicable\n\n                                       8\n\n            to the Publishers' subscribers and other third party users for             access to the Publishers' Content on the Site. The Site shall be             designed to permit automated loading and maintenance of subscription             data from the Publishers' fulfilment systems. The Specification             details the procedures for loading such subscription information             (including both bulk entry and single entry information) and timing             for access to the Site for users included on such updated             subscription data.\n\n      13.2.

In relation to sales the Publishers make direct, the Publishers             shall establish copyright and other fees for such sales (\"Article             Fees\"). HealthGate shall collect the Article Fees established by             Publishers plus a service fee to be determined by HealthGate but in             any event the service fee may not exceed 30% of the Article Fee for             the particular article, or $US 4, whichever is the higher. Within 60             days of the end of each calendar month, HealthGate shall forward to             Publishers the net Article Fees actually collected (exclusive of             HealthGate's service fee).\n\n      14.3. The Publishers may also permit third party intermediaries to sell             individual articles and other items, on terms to be agreed between             the Publishers and such third party intermediaries. Neither the\n\n\n\n\n\n            Publishers nor the third party intermediaries shall be required to             pay a service fee or any other additional fee for this service, nor             shall HealthGate be permitted to collect a service fee, its             remuneration being as provided in Clause 19 and in Schedule 2 (Use             Fees).\n\n15.   Improvements\n\n      HealthGate shall replace and upgrade the Software to satisfy the       requirements of the Specification at no extra cost to the Publishers.\n\n                                       9\n\n16.

Assistance upon Termination\n\n      On termination of the provision of the Services by HealthGate to the       Publishers for any reason:\n\n                                       10\n\n      18.1.

The period of             liaison will commence as soon as notice has been given of             termination of this Agreement, and will continue for a maximum             period of 3 months after termination;\n\n      18.2. HealthGate agrees that at the time of termination of this Agreement,             it will render all assistance, provide all documentation and             undertake all actions to the extent necessary to effect an orderly             assumption of the Services by the Publishers or, at the Publishers'             option, by a replacement contractor;\n\n      18.3. If the Publishers so require, HealthGate will use its best             endeavours to procure the transfer at the Publishers' expense, to             the Publishers or to a third party nominated by the Publishers at             the Publishers' sole discretion, of any Third Party Software             licences HealthGate may have obtained in its own name in order to             provide the Services and used for that purpose exclusively; and\n\n      18.4. HealthGate will be obliged to satisfy the Publishers that it has             erased the Publishers Content and all copies, and that it has no             ability to reproduce the Publishers Content in any way.\n\n            The rights of the Publishers in this Clause 18 are in addition to             the rights in Clause 33.\n\n19.

Scenarios\n\n      This chapter contains the Blackwell/Munksgaard Journal Publishing system       user scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Registration - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGeneral Registration\n\n      Users who access Blackwell/Munksgaard publications will fall into one of       three categories:\n\n      a)    Non-registered users who are browsing Blackwell/Munksgaard content.             These users will have limited access to some free content, but will             not be able to access other areas or purchase products.\n\n      b)    Registered users who have provided name, email and postal mailing             address, but have not provided credit card data. Users in this             category include those who have visited the site before and have             been assigned a user name and password, as well as Society members             who have previously registered.\n\n      c)    Purchasing users who have registered, and provided credit card             information. These users may have bought subscriptions to             Blackwell/Munksgaard journals or other publications in the past.\n\n      For any but the most casual browser, general registration is encouraged,       and outlined below.\n\n      1.    Registration procedure: If a non-registered user would like to             access certain areas or services, there will be a link provided to             the registration area.\n\n            Once the user has entered the registration area, s/he will be asked             to provide full name, email address, and postal address. After this             information has been entered, the user will be provided with a             dialog box to enter a self-selected user name and password.\n\n      2.    Creating user name: The user name is checked for uniqueness against             all user names, then added to the database. If the name has already             been registered, the user will be provided with three suggested             names, or the option to create another user name of their own             choice.\n\n      3.    Confirmation of registration: Once a unique user name and password             have been assigned, the user may choose to continue the purchase             process by linking to pages that will enable him/her to enter credit             card information (see \"Credit Card Subscription Registration\"             below). If no purchase is desired at this time, the user will end             the registration process at this point S/he will see a page that             confirms their registration. Shortly afterwards, the user will also             receive an email acknowledging their registration, and providing             instructions on what to do if they forget their user name and             password. This will also serve to ensure that the user's email             address as entered in the registration form is correct.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD PUBLISHING SYSTEM                                         3\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                      REGISTRATION - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCredit Card Subscription Registration\n\n      Users will now be able to order subscriptions to Blackwell/Munksgaard       journals and publications online via a simple registration and secure       payment process. In this scenario, the user chooses to pay with a credit       card.\n\n      1.    Registration: When the user enters the registration area, s/he will             be asked to provide their user name and password. (See \"General             Registration\" above).\n\n      2.    Tracking marketing efforts: A feature to track the efficacy of             marketing campaigns may also be incorporated. In addition to             entering the above subscriber information, the user will also be             asked to provide information pertaining to offer codes, or other             identifying characteristics of marketing offers.\n\n      3.    Separating society memberships: Users are asked if they are a member             of a society participating in the online journals. If they select a             society, their registration information will be checked with an             updated automated listing of existing society members. Since a             society member is entitled to pre-defined journal subscriptions             under a separate agreement, this is done to ensure that a society             member is not charged. If the registering user is determined to be a             society member, follow the \"Society Member Registration\" scenario             instead.\n\n      4.    Selecting a subscription plan: After entering the registration             information, the user will be prompted to select a subscription             plan.\n\n      5.    Charging subscriptions: Once the subscription plan has been             selected, the user will then be shown a page that provides a secure             connection for credit card information. The user will be asked to\n\n\n\n\n\n            give the credit card number, type (VISA, MasterCard, AMEX,             Discover), and expiration date.\n\n      6.    Transaction receipt: The credit card is then validated and the user             is shown the cost that has been charged to the credit card. A             receipt is displayed on the screen, as well as emailed to the user.\n\n      7.    Thanks/Email notification of future publications: After the             registration process is completed, the user will see a page thanking             them for their subscription order. As an added feature, new users             will be offered the option of having the table of contents of each             new issue emailed to them upon publication.\n\n      8.    Next destination: When the above information is provided, the user             will then be given access to the cover page of the journal that has             just been ordered.\n\nSociety Member / Institutional Subscriber Self Registration\n\n      If a user is determined to be a Society member or a paid subscriber not       know to the system (pre-subscribed by Blackwell/Munksgaard), the following       scenario applies:\n\n      1.    Access from marketing efforts: Society membership benefits include             subscriptions to pre-defined print journals. In accordance with             marketing efforts, inserts promoting online journal registration and             the URL for the Blackwell/Munksgaard site will be provided in these             journals. Members may also find out about online service via other             marketing efforts, such as newsletters, leaflets, direct mail or             other web sites.\n\n      2.    Registration info: Once the user accesses the site, he/she will be             provided with a form asking for basic registration information (see             \"Credit Card Subscription Registration,\" steps 1-7).\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                        4\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                      REGISTRATION - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      3.    Membership options: If the name has been matched and verified online             as a Society member, the user is presented with a listing of             publications and journals, etc. which they may access with existing             membership privileges.\n\n            If the user is not verified as a current Society member, the user             will be asked to provide standard registration information (see             \"Credit Card Subscription Registration\").\n\n            In addition to the publication listings, users will be given one of             three options as defined by the publisher to receive these             subscriptions:\n\n            a. Exclusive online access\n\n            b. Print subscription and optional online access\n\n            c. Full access via both print subscription and online\n\n      4.    Content for purchase: Once users have selected their subscription             method, they will be shown additional content available for             purchase.\n\n      5.    Creating identity code for user: When content for purchase has been             selected by the user, s/he will see a form that enables them to             create a user name and password. Once the information has been             entered, another dialog box will prompt them to confirm the             password.\n\n      6.    Assuring uniqueness of code: The user name is checked for uniqueness             against all user names, and added to the list. If the user name has             already been registered, they will be provided with three suggested             names, or the option to create another user name of their own             choice.\n\n      7.    Purchasing additional content: If the user chooses to purchase any             of the additional content, the purchase will be charged to the             credit card information previously provided. The credit card is             validated and charged. If the credit card is declined, the user is             prompted to try again.\n\n      8.    Transaction receipt: Once the credit card has been validated, the             page shows the cost that has been charged to the credit card.             Receipt is presented on the screen, as well as emailed to the user.\n\n      9.    Final step of purchasing process: As the final step in the             purchasing process, the user will see a page that thanks them for             their order, and shows a listing of all content purchased in the             last transaction.\n\n            After purchasing process has been completed, the user will then be             given access to their selected content. A confirmation email will be             sent welcoming the user to our service.\n\n\n\n\n\nPurchase Order or Deposit Account for Institutional Subscribers\n\n      For those institutions that wish to order subscriptions to       Blackwell/Munksgaard journals, publications, and single full-text articles       on a consistent basis, an open purchase order or deposit account may be       established. The following scenario outlines how a customer would have       access via this method.\n\n      1.    Initial set-up: The customer will make the initial contact to             Blackwell/Munksgaard to set up the account. Open purchase orders and             deposit accounts may be established through either             Blackwell/Munksgaard or HealthGate.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                        5\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                      REGISTRATION - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      2.    Access code: After the account has been established, users will then             be given a special access code to access the Site. When registering             the user will be able to use the access code instead of providing us             with credit card information (Access to publications via IP address             verification is an option for institutional accounts).\n\n      3.    Registration: When the user completes registration the same way as a             normal customer, except that they enter the access code rather than             provide billing information. Any charges or purchases will be             applied to their account.\n\n      4.    Account expiration: If the account expires, or reaches the monetary             cap assigned, the user will be shown a page that prompts them to             contact Blackwell/Munksgaard to renew the account. This page will             also provide the option to continue and have purchases applied to a             credit card. A report will be available warning Blackwell/Munksgaard             of accounts that are close to expiring.\n\nTransaction Registration /Single Document Purchase by non registered user\n\n      This scenario outlines the way in which a user would be able to purchase a       single article (document) while browsing the abstract of the article.\n\n      1.    Promoting full text articles: Abstracts are available to all users             free of charge; registration is not required. However, if the user             would like to buy the full text of any given article, pricing             information for the article will be listed at the end of the             abstract, with a link to purchase the article.\n\n      2.    Purchasing full text -- registered users: After selecting the link             to purchase the article, the user is given the option to log in,             using the previously assigned registration user name and password.             After logging in, a page showing full text articles and journal             subscriptions for purchase will be provided. The user will make             his/her selections, and the credit card information page will             appear. (Go to step #5)\n\n      3.    Purchasing full text -- new users: If the user has never registered             before, they will be asked to register.\n\n      4.    Registration: When the user enters the registration area, s/he will             be asked to provide basic identifying information (See \"General             Registration\" above).\n\n      5.    Credit card info: The user will then be shown a page that provides a             secure connection for credit card information. The user will be             asked to give the credit card number, type (VISA, MasterCard, AMEX,             Discover), and expiration date.\n\n      6.    Credit card validation: The credit card is validated, and the user             is given confirmation that they are about to be charged for the             requested full text article(s) and/or journal subscription(s).\n\n      7.    Fax delivery/other purchase options: An option to have the article             faxed to them for an additional fee (to be determined) is also             offered.\n\n      8.    Transaction confirmation: Once the user has completed the above             steps, a receipt listing all purchases is shown on the page; a copy             will also be emailed to them.\n\n      9.    Transaction cancellation: If the user cancels the transaction, then             they are returned to the abstract of the article.\n\n      10.   Content access: After the user confirms the charge, s/he is given             access to the content for a specified period of time (hours/days to             be determined.)\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                        6\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                         PURCHASES - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n            Articles are provided to the user in both PDF and HTML format\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Purchases - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      The scenarios below outline single document purchases. There also will be       a facility to purchase multiple documents in a shopping basked like       manner.\n\nSingle Document Purchase Registered User with CC Information\n\n      In this scenario, a registered user requests a document to which they do       not currently have access. For example, they may be viewing an abstract       from a journal that is not part of their subscription, or they may be       referencing a new document (full text) In this scenario we assume that the       user has a credit card on file or an open purchase order (PO).\n\n      1.    Registration update: At the end of an abstract, a link is provided             which enables the user to purchase a related document or product             (i.e., full text article, journal subscription, book, etc.) The link             brings the user to a page that offers purchase options, lists the             price of the full text article and allows registered users to enter             their user name and password. Non-registered users would have to             register in order to enter credit card information.\n\n      2.    Login: Registered users will log on, confirming registration. Then             they will be shown a price confirmation and delivery options.\n\n      3.    Optional fax delivery: If the requested document is an article, the             user will be offered an option to have the article faxed for an             additional fee (to be determined).\n\n      4.    Transaction confirmation: Once the user has completed the above             steps, a receipt listing all purchases is shown on the page; a copy             will also be emailed to them.\n\n      5.    Transaction cancellation: If the user cancels the transaction, they             are returned to the abstract of the article.\n\n      6.    Content access: After the user confirms the charge, s/he is given             access to the content for a specified period of time (hours/days to             be determined.)\n\n            Articles are provided to the user in both HTML and PDF formats.\n\nSingle Document Purchase Registered User without CC Information\n\n      In this scenario, a registered user requests to see a document to which       they do not currently have access. For example, they may be viewing an       abstract from a new journal and decide they would like to subscribe. In       this scenario, we assume that the user does not have a credit card on file       or an open PO.\n\n      1.    Registration update: At the end of an abstract, a link is provided             which enables the user to purchase a related document or product             (i.e., full text article, journal subscription, book, etc.) The link             brings the user to a page that offers purchase options, and lists             the price of the full text article. The user will be asked to a)             register, or b) login.\n\n      2.    Login. Registered users will login.\n\n      3.    Credit card info: Then if they do not have credit card information             on file or if their credit card has expired, they will be shown a             page which provides a secure connection for credit card information.             The user will be asked to give the credit card number, type (VISA,             MasterCard, AMEX, Discover), and expiration date.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                        7\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                         PURCHASES - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      4.    Credit card validation: The credit card is validated, and the user             is given confirmation that they are about to be charged for the             requested full text article(s) journal subscription(s), etc. (Any             relevant discounts will be shown on screen at this time.)\n\n      5.    Optional fax delivery: If the requested document is an article, the             user will be offered an option to have the article faxed for an             additional fee (to be determined).\n\n      6.    Transaction confirmation: Once the user has completed the above             steps, a receipt listing all purchases is shown on the page; a copy             will also be emailed to them.\n\n      7.    Transaction cancellation: If the user cancels the transaction, they             are returned to the abstract of the article.\n\n      8.    Content access: After the user confirms the charge, he/she is given             access to the content for a specified period of time (hours/days to\n\n\n\n\n\n            be determined).\n\n            Articles are provided to the user in both HTML and PDF formats.\n\nSingle Document Purchase Registered User using Purchase Order\n\n      In this scenario, a registered user requests a document to which they do       not currently have access and choose to pay via an existing purchase order       which they have set up with Blackwell/Munksgaard. If they do not have a       purchase order, they will be asked to contact Blackwell/Munksgaard.\n\n      1.    Registration update: At the end of an abstract, a link is provided             which enables the user to purchase a related document or product             (i.e., full text article, journal subscription, book, etc.) The link             brings the user to a page that offers purchase options, and lists             the price of the full text article. The user will be asked to a)             register, or b) login.\n\n      2.    Login. Registered users will login with an account that has been             tagged for all charges to be applied to an existing purchase order.\n\n      3.    Purchase Order validation: The purchase order is validated to assure             that this charge will not go over the total amount on the purchase             order. The user is given confirmation that they are about to be             charged for the requested full text article(s). (Any relevant             discounts will be shown on screen at this time.)\n\n      4.    Optional fax delivery: If the requested document is an article, the             user will be offered an option to have the article faxed for an             additional fee (to be determined).\n\n      5.    Transaction confirmation: Once the user has completed the above             steps, a receipt listing all purchases is shown on the page; a copy             will also be emailed to them.\n\n      6.    Transaction cancellation: If the user cancels the transaction, they             are returned to the abstract of the article.\n\n      7.    Content access: After the user confirms the charge, he/she is given             access to the content for a specified period of time (hours/days to             be determined.)\n\n            Articles are provided to the user in both HTML and PDF formats.\n\nAdditional Subscription Purchase\n\n      Online users will be provided with several opportunities throughout the       site to subscribe to other journals; these purchase options will be       inserted in areas that contextually will promote the likelihood of a sale.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                        8\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                           LINKING - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      The following scenario provides an example of how the need for additional       full text articles and/or a journal subscription results in a sale.\n\n      1.    Point of entry: A user reads an article in a journal to which they             subscribe. Searching for more information in this subject area, the             user clicks on the link to related articles.\n\n      2.    Exposure to new journal: After viewing the list of related articles,             the user notes that the articles of the most interest are all in a             journal to which s/he does not currently subscribe. At this point             the user has a choice: s/he may either purchase the full text of             some or all the articles, or consider a subscription to the journal             itself, which will provide unlimited access to these and other             articles year-round. The user decides to find out more information             about the journal.\n\n      3.    Journal description: All journal titles will be linked. When the             user clicks on a journal link, he/she will see a page that provides             a brief description of the journal, the frequency of publication,             and pricing information.\n\n      4.    Purchasing procedure: The user decides to purchase the journal.             Since this user has already subscribed to at least one other             journal, his/her identification and credit card data are already             stored in the system.\n\n            The user is given the option of charging the subscription to the             existing account, or entering new credit card information. (See             \"Credit Card Subscription Registration\" above).\n\n      5.    Confirmation of purchase: Once the user has indicated which credit             card is to be charged, the purchase is charged and validated. The             user will then be shown a page that provides a receipt for the             journal subscription purchase. Confirmation of the purchase will             also be sent to the user via email.\n\n      6.    Other tie-ins to purchase: After confirmation, the user may link to             his/her own custom page to find that the new subscription has been\n\n\n\n\n\n            documented, and the custom page updated.\n\n      7.    Next destination: At the end of the transaction, the user will be             shown the selected volume of the journal.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Linking - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBibliographic Linking within an Article\n\n      This scenario illustrates how a user would link to and from bibliographic       information contained within an article.\n\n      1.    Reference links: Reference citations within all articles will be             linked to bibliographic references (or endnotes.) When the user             clicks on the citation in the article, a page showing the complete             listing of references for that article will be displayed.\n\n      2.    Database links: When the user clicks on the MEDLINE link, s/he will             be shown the corresponding MEDLINE abstract for the cited article,             if the journal is indexed for inclusion in MEDLINE. (Similar             functionality will exist with ISI Web of Science).\n\n      3.    Full text/Journal subscription purchase option: If full text is             available for the cited reference, it will be offered for purchase             at this point; journal subscription purchase may be offered as well.             Abstracts will also be available from the references. These purchase             options will be displayed along with pricing information. If the             user is not a subscriber to the cited journal, and chooses to             purchase the article, or subscribe to the journal, new pages\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                        9\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                  DELIVERY OPTIONS OTHER THAN HTML - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n            leading them through the purchase process will automatically be             shown. (See \"Single Document Purchase\" and \"Additional Subscription             Purchase\" above.)\n\n      4.    Subscription tracking: If the user is already a subscriber to the             journal that contains the selected article, the user will be             informed that they may access the article free.\n\n      5.    Other reference options: All articles will also contain a side bar             which lists (and links to) other full text articles available within             the Blackwell/Munksgaard collection that references this article             (forward bibliographic references).\n\n      6.    In Press Bibliographic Links: Links will not exist to bibliographic             references that are still in press. However, the system will check             regularly to link them once the article has been published.\n\n      7.    Exit from abstract: The user will also be able to return to the             previous article from the abstract.\n\nRelated Information Links\n\n      When viewing an article, the user will be provided with a side bar that       outlines several related links pertaining to the article they are       currently reading. In this scenario, we highlight some of the different       types of links that may be offered.\n\n      1.    Author listing: The names of all authors of the current article will             be provided as links. When the user clicks on the link of a selected             author, s/he will be presented with a listing of other articles             written by that author. These titles will be linked to the             corresponding abstract and/or full text. If available, full text             purchase and/or PDF versions of the selected article will be             offered.\n\n      2.    Related articles by subject: A listing of related linked subject             areas will also be provided. When the user clicks on these areas,             s/he will receive a listing of related articles searched by MeSH             headings and keywords.\n\n      3.    Related published information: Users interested in reading other             published information related to the chosen article will find that             the side bar provides them with links to:\n\n            a. Correspondence (letters, editorials, etc) pertaining to that             article\n\n            b. Errata (article addenda, corrections, etc.) pertaining to that             article\n\n      4.    Services: The user will also be able to take advantage of certain             services. One service will be the ability to email the URL of a             chosen article to a colleague. When the user chooses this option,             s/he will be presented with a page to enter an email address, and a             \"send\" button.\n\n\n\n\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Delivery Options Other than HTML - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDownloading PDF\n\n      For those full text articles available in PDF format, the user will be       given the option of PDF downloading.\n\n      1.    Linked PDF option: On the article page, a link offering the PDF             option will be found. The users will have the option to download the             PDF file or have it emailed to them. If the user choose to download             the document they will be prompted to save it.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                       10\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                               SUBSCRIBER FEATURES - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      2.    Adobe instructions for downloading: If the user does not have             Acrobat installed, the download page will explain the need to             install the Acrobat plug-in. A link to Adobe for detailed             instructions on how to install the plug-in will be provided.\n\n            If the user does not wish to download Acrobat at that time, the user             will be prompted to download to their hard drive. They may open the             PDF document after Acrobat has been downloaded at their convenience.\n\nFax Delivery\n\n            Users who want the benefits of how an article appears in PDF, but             who do not wish to download the article in this format, can request             fax delivery of the article for an additional charge.\n\n      1.    After confirming that the user wishes to purchase an article (or in             the case of subscriptions, displaying the record on screen), the             user selects the method of displaying the article: HTML, PDF, or             \"Receive via Fax.\" Because this is a premium option, the user will             be asked to confirm the additional fees for fax delivery.\n\n      2.    The user then supplies their fax number.\n\n      3.    To keep costs low, the article is relayed to a commercial fax             service, such as FaxNet, which sends the information via Web-based             fax to the user.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Subscriber Features - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUser Access to their Custom Page\n\n      Another free feature offered to Blackwell/Munksgaard subscribers is a       custom-designed page which will provide them with information tailored to       their unique areas of interest, as well as accounting of their       subscription plans and other services. The following are highlights of       features that may be offered to subscribers.\n\n      1.    Initial log-in: The user accesses the Blackwell/Munksgaard Journals             home page. From this page there is a login link that requires the             user to enter their user name and password (if they are unable to             remember their user name and password, they may enter their email             address, which will then provide them with the correct login             information via return email). Once the correct information has been             entered, subscribers are brought to their custom page.\n\n      2.    Custom Page features: The custom page will provide the user with:\n\n            a. Subscription information: All subscription information pertaining             to the user's account will be provided, including: names of journal             subscriptions (listed and linked), pricing of each subscription, and             the duration of subscription.\n\n            b. Updates on new content: Each subscriber will be provided with             updates on new content that correlates to their specified area(s) of             interest. This includes new journal articles, correspondence, news,             etc.\n\n            c. Customer Service: Users can choose to change their password,             subscriptions, credit card information, etc. by accessing the             customer service area at any time. Users may also email questions             regarding their subscription in this customer service area.\n\n            d. Searching: The user will have a variety of methods to track and             save searches from the custom page, including:\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                       11\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                  JOURNAL FEATURES - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n                  i) Entering searches from various journal sets (e.g., searches                   of just Blackwell/Munksgaard journals, or all journals in a                   related subject area.)\n\n                  ii) Saved searches: The user will have the ability to view the                   last five documents reviewed or the last five subject area                   searches conducted.\n\n                  iii) Collaborative filtering: In the future once an article                   has been read, a user may choose to review which related                   articles have been read by other users. A listing of the most                   frequently accessed articles in the topic will be provided.\n\n                  (For a more detailed description of the searching                   capabilities, see the \"Searching\" category below.)\n\n            e. Promotions and advertising: The user will be notified in the             Custom Page of any promotions that may be of interest (i.e.,             discount rates, product offers, society notices, etc.) In addition,             users will be able to view advertising pertaining to their interests             on this page.\n\n            f. Interactive communication: This area will contain features that             allow users to communicate via email with Blackwell/Munksgaard. This             may be used, for example, to post notices of errata for articles. A             mechanism for acknowledging these notices will also be provided.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Journal Features - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      The following scenarios pertain to organization of the journals and their       various components on the Blackwell/Munksgaard site.\n\nJournal Page\n\n      Users will be able to access information pertaining to subscriptions and       other publisher information directly from the journal pages, which will be       customized for each specific journal. We recommend that these pages follow       a standardized format, including links to the following (where       applicable):\n\n      a)    Publisher's home page: A link will bring the user to the home page             of the appropriate publisher of the journal, either             Blackwell/Munksgaard Science Ltd., Blackwell/Munksgaard Science             Inc., or Munksgaard.\n\n      b)    Society's home page: If the journal is published for a society,             users will be able to directly link to the society's home page\n\n      c)    Journal information: Information regarding publication cycles and             other publication information will be provided via this link.\n\n      d)    Journal subscriptions: If a user wishes to find detailed information             about subscribing to journals, this link will bring them to a page             which will provide pricing information, etc.\n\n      e)    Journal listing by publisher: This link will provide the user with a             complete listing of journals, categorized by publisher\n\n      f)    Listing of available back issues: For users wishing to search             previous journal issues, this link will show a listing of back             issues available\n\n      g)    Current table of contents: Users will be able to quickly access the             most current table of contents from this link\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                       12\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                  JOURNAL FEATURES - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      h)    Submission information: Prospective authors will find author's             guidelines and other submission information at this link\n\n      i)    Letter to the editor via email: Users who wish to contribute             opinions to the journal editor will be able to link to a pop-up             email window, and send correspondence via email.

A link from the bibliographic reference to the abstract             (pulled from secondary databases, reference databases), if             available, is provided. If the corresponding article is available             online in the Blackwell/Munksgaard collection, a link to the             full-text with option to purchase will be provided.\n\n      b)    Publication listing by author: All primary authors of the article             will be listed. The name of each author will be linked so that if             the user selects the author's name, a listing will be provided of             other available articles written this author. Again, these articles             in turn will be linked to their corresponding abstracts. If the             corresponding article is available online in the             Blackwell/Munksgaard collection, a link to the full-text with option             to purchase will be provided.\n\n      c)    Link by keywords: The user will be provided with an option to search             for other related articles by keyword.\n\n      d)    Email option: If a user would like to send a link to the abstract to             a colleague, an email window will be available. The user only needs             to type in the destination email address, and an automatic message             providing the article title and corresponding URL of the abstract             will be sent.\n\n      e)    Supplemental Information: Links to supplemental information related             to the article will be presented if the information is available.\n\nEmail version of Table of Contents\n\n      A valuable reminder of newly released publications is the table of       contents email option. If users choose this feature (usually done during       subscription registration and payment), they will be sent the new table of       contents for each journal to which they have subscribed. This feature will       be available to both subscribers as well as non-subscribing users.\n\n\n\n\n\n      This scenario shows what a user can do after receiving an emailed version       of the table of contents. The scenario has two parts: one for text-based       email, the other for HTML enabled email.\n\nText Email\n\n      1.    Receipt of email announcement: User receives an email message and             opens it in their email reader.\n\n      2.    Table of contents listing: The message contains the table of             contents of the newly published issue of the journal.\n\n      3.    URL linking: The email contains the URL for the Blackwell/Munksgaard             site. This link will be \"live\" in most email readers, and will bring             the user directly to the online version of the table of contents.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                       14\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                         SEARCHING - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      4.    Article linking: Once the user accesses the table of contents, s/he             will find that all titles are linked to abstracts and the online             full text article.\n\nHTML Email\n\n      1.    Receipt of email announcement: The user receives an HTML based email             message, and opens it in their HTML enabled mail reader (e.g.,             Outlook Express, Outlook 98, Netscape 3.x and higher).\n\n      2.    Table of contents: The message contains the complete table of             contents, and may be viewed exactly as it would look on the web             site.\n\n      3.    URL linking: The email contains the URL for the Blackwell/Munksgaard             site. This link will be clickable in most email readers, and will             bring the user directly to the online version of the table of             contents.\n\n      4.    Article linking: Once the user accesses the table of contents, s/he             will find that all titles are linked to abstracts and the online             full text article.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Searching - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      The capacity to search using a variety of keywords and subject headings is       of critical importance to users, and is an especially important feature of       the Blackwell/Munksgaard site.\n\n      Users will have the ability to select which set of journals to search.       Some example sets are: All Full Text Journals, All Subscribed Journals,       and Journals by particular Publisher. Searches that return a single       document will forward the user to the abstract or full text if they have       access to the full text.\n\n      The following scenarios outline several ways in which a subscriber may       search for content. In addition to offering different types of searching       mechanisms (i.e., \"quick searches\" through advanced searches), users will       also be able to access the searching capability from various areas of the       site. The following scenarios outline some of the search possibilities.\n\nQuick Search\n\n      A \"Quick Search\" enables the user to search on a topic (e.g., insulin       pumps) and obtain a listing of areas where this topic is cited.\n\n      1.    From custom page: From the custom page, users would enter a keyword             or phrase in the quick search box. The user would select the All             Subscribed journal set, and then submit the query.\n\n      2.    Results: The search returns a listing of all articles; each linked             to the full text, PDF, and the abstract where available.\n\n      3.    Save Query: On the results page, the user would have the option of             saving the query. This adds the query to the user's customized page.\n\nSearching Full Text\n\n      Another option is to search the entire full text of a document for       specific terms. The following is a sample of how this search could be       conducted from the user's custom page.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                       15\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                     CUSTOMER HELP - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n      1.    Advanced search option: The user selects the advanced search option             from the search box.\n\n      2.    Document choice: The user decides to view only abstracts; s/he             selects this choice from the pull down list of available fields to             search.\n\n      3.    Subject choice: The user chooses the keyword or phrase they wish to             search, (e.g., lispro or Humalog), and enters it into the advanced             search form. This criterion is then added to the query.\n\n      4.    Journal choice: The user then selects the journal set to search, and             selects the \"All Full Text Journals\" option. The query is then             submitted.\n\n      5.    Results: The results contain a listing of all full text articles             available that match the user's search criteria. Included in this             list is the price of each full text document that references these             keywords, with the option to download. In addition, the entries that             the user has subscription access to would be noted. Results can be             ordered by relevancy, date, author and journal title.\n\n            The user has the ability to save the query.\n\nFinding an Article Cited Elsewhere\n\n      This scenario provides the user with HealthGate's Citation Finder       Technology. It allows a subscriber the ability to quickly locate the       abstract (and the full text if available) from a bibliographic reference.\n\n      1.    Access from custom page: From the registered subscriber's customized             page, s/he selects the Citation Finder option. The Citation Finder             page is pre-loaded and has a field for entry of the citation. The             user can either input the citation information or \"copy and paste\"             it into the appropriate fields. The Citation Finder does not require             information in all fields to execute a search successfully.\n\n      2.    Search criteria: The user then selects the fields, or information,             which s/he wants to search. Examples of these fields include author,             journal name, year, volume, issue, article title, and all fields.             For this example, the user selects author, article title, and             journal name.\n\n      3.    Results: The user submits the query. If an exact match is found, the             abstract will be provided. If not, the user is presented with a list             of matches from which to select.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Customer Help - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      Blackwell/Munksgaard will have administrative access to these features.       All access will be recorded to monitor any possible abuse.\n\nForgotten Password\n\n      When a user forgets his/her password, the system provides a mechanism for       the user to look up and find their password without calling customer       service. This scenario shows how that is accomplished:\n\n      1.    On the login page, a user who has forgotten their password selects             the link \"forgotten password.\"\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                       16\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                     CUSTOMER HELP - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      2.    The user is asked to complete a form where the required information             is user name, first name, and last name.\n\n      3.    The system will search the user database to see if there is a match.             If there is a match, the system will send the user's password to the             email address on file. The system will then tell the user that their             password is being sent to them via email.\n\n      4.    If there is not a match, the system will prompt them to try again or             allow them to search for user name and password.\n\nForgotten User Name and Password\n\n      When a user forgets his/her password, the system provides a mechanism for       the user to look up and find their password without calling customer       service. This scenario shows how that is accomplished:\n\n      1.    On the login page, a user who has forgotten their password selects             the link \"forgotten password.\"\n\n      2.    If they do not remember their user name, the user is prompted to             enter their first name, last name, and email address.\n\n      3.    The system will compare the information supplied by the user against             the user database and email both the user name and password to the\n\n\n\n\n\n            address on file if there is a match.\n\n      4.    If there is not a match, the user is instructed to either try again             or contact customer service.\n\nChanging Password\n\n      Users often want to change their password. The system gives them an easy       way to do so.\n\n      1.    From the user's personal profile page, the user selects the link to             \"Modify Profile.\"\n\n      2.    The Modify Profile page will allow them to go to a change password             form.\n\n      3.    This form will ask the user to type their current password, then             enter a new password. To confirm, the user is asked to type their             new password again.\n\n      4.    Upon correct entry (the old password matched the one on file and the             two new passwords matched), the password will be updated and the             user will be told that the change has been made.\n\n      5.    If the entry is not correct then the user will be prompted to try             again.\n\nChanging Email Address\n\n      Users often want to change their email address. The system gives them an       easy way to do so.\n\n      1.    This feature is available in several places, such as the \"Modify             Profile\" page and the regularly scheduled email messages sent by the             system to the user.\n\n      2.    From the Modify Profile page, the user would select a link to change             their email address. From an email message, the user selects the             link embedded in the email. When accessing the appropriate page via             the email link, the user will be prompted for user name and             password.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                       17\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                CONTENT MANAGEMENT - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      3.    A form will ask for the users new email address (actually allowing             them to edit their old email address).\n\n      4.    Upon successful entry, the email address is checked for validity and             an email message is sent the address for confirmation.\n\nChanging Credit Card Number\n\n      Users often want to change their credit card information on file. The       system gives them an easy way to do so. This method of updating the credit       card is also used when the credit card on file has expired. Customers with       expired credit cards are forced to enter a new credit card when they are       about to incur additional charges.\n\n      1.    This feature is available from the \"Modify Profile\" page.\n\n      2.    The user is connected to the secure server and asked to enter the             new credit card information.\n\n      3.    The credit card is validated with a credit card clearing house.\n\n      4.    If validated, the user is given a confirmation page.\n\n      5.    If the card is not validated, the user is asked to try again.\n\nChanging Other Information\n\n      Users are able to change other information off the \"Modify Profile\" page       by selecting the appropriate link. Examples of other information that may       be changed are postal address, purchasing new subscriptions, and change       the format in which they received emailed information (HTML verses text).\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Content Management - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJournal Setup\n\n      The procedure to setup new journals and their initial entry into the       system must be initiated by Blackwell/Munksgaard. It is possible to setup       a journal manually or electronically. The manual procedure for setting up       a new journal entry is as follows:\n\n      1.    The authorized Blackwell/Munksgaard employee establishes a             connection to the Administration side of the site.\n\n\n\n\n\n      2.    When prompted, the employee enters the appropriate user             name/password and establishes a secure connection.\n\n      3.    The employee selects the option New Journal and enters all             applicable information, such as title, copyright statements,             submissions, subscription, etc.\n\n      4.    The employee enters Society information, if applicable, including             name, links, and board members.\n\nSet Journal Price\n\n      It is possible to setup a journal price manually or electronically. After       setting up the basic journal information, pricing criteria may be entered:\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                       18\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                CONTENT PUBLISHING - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      1.    The authorized Blackwell/Munksgaard employee accesses the             appropriate journal (the journal must be setup using the Journal             Setup before establishing the journal price) and selects the option             \"Journal Pricing.\"\n\n      2.    The employee then assigns the price in multiple currencies, any and             all subscription plans, including rates for print companion,             electronic only, and Society membership.\n\n      3.    The employee then assigns pricing for each of the selected             currencies.\n\nSet Document Price\n\n      1.    The default for all document pricing is established by             Blackwell/Munksgaard. The Blackwell/Munksgaard employee may override             the default and establish a special price for documents from a             specific journal title.\n\n      2.    To override the default document price, the employee accesses the             appropriate journal (the journal must be setup using the Journal             Setup before establishing the document price) and selects the option             \"Document Pricing.\"\n\n      3.    The employee then assigns the revised price in various currencies             for document delivery.\n\n      4.    The price may be revised to the default at any time by accessing the             journal and selecting the option to Restore Default Price.\n\nTemplate Submission\n\n      Initially, templates will be hand loaded by HealthGate Data Corp. to       insure security and consistency.\n\n      To accomplish this, an FTP location will be provided to allow templates to       be copied over and reviewed (and tested) prior to releasing them.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Content Publishing - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIssue Loading\n\n      1.    Loading upon receipt: All content for a new issue is loaded upon             receipt in a single directory.\n\n      2.    Identification: A form is completed which indicates appropriate             journal, issue, and volume. It is also possible to enter this             information electronically.\n\n      3.    Back-up: Upon submission, the content is copied to the content             repository, before conversion. This allows it to be referenced in             the future.\n\n      4.    Conversion: The content is then converted to our internal Extensible             Markup Language (XML) format.\n\n      5.    Storage: The XML version is then stored in the content repository.\n\n      6.    Parsing: The XML is then parsed to add more information, including             tags to link bibliographic information and related information.\n\n      7.    Storage of parsed content: This parsed XML version is also stored in             the content repository.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                       19\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                THIRD PARTY ACCESS - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n      8.    Conversion to HTML: An Extensible Style Language (XSL) template is             used to convert the file to HTML.\n\n      9.    HTML on staging: The HTML version is made available on the staging             server.\n\nIssue Review\n\n      1.    The issue is made available on the staging server\n\n      2.    Email is sent to Blackwell/Munksgaard alerting the appropriate             personnel that the issue is available for review.\n\n      3.    An employee wishing to review the issue would log on to the staging             server, and select the content they wish to review. This is limited             to authorized users only. Authorization is by group of journals.\n\n      4.    The content is presented to them in the same way it is shown to an             end user. However, they also have access to a tool bar (in a frame).             The tool bar allows them to approve the content as well as adjust             some of the properties of the article.\n\n      5.    They can change the price or approve the article for release.\n\nIssue Release\n\n      An issue will be released automatically on the assigned electronic       publication date if all the articles contained in the issue have been       edited and approved for release. Blackwell/Munksgaard will be alerted to       content that has not be reviewed after a predetermined amount of time.\n\n      A Blackwell/Munksgaard employee would access the Journal Publishing       System, a secure area, and go to the System Control area.\n\n      1.    A list of issues that are ready or awaiting publication would be             available. When an issue is selected, the listing of properties for             that issue will be presented.\n\n      2.    The user would be able to adjust any of the properties.\n\n      3.    To publish the issue, the user would set the publication date to the             following day.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Third Party Access - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGeneral\n\n      Creating an abstract-only export: To create an abstract-only export, a       Blackwell/Munksgaard employee will need to determine the list of journal       abstracts to be included for extract, the formatting of the extract, and a       user profile of which third parties will have access to the extract file.\n\n      1.    Criteria: Once the above information has been determined, the             following information will need to be entered:\n\n            a. Frequency of updating abstract information,\n\n            b. Packaging method (tar, zip), push, pull or tape.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                       20\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                         REPORTING - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      2.    Push extracts: For push extracts (extracts that are sent to someone             either via FTP or email), a user will have to enter the destination             email address, or the FTP server, directory, user name and password             to use.\n\n      3.    Pull extracts: For pull extracts (extracts that require someone to             pull the content off the journal server), a user will have to enter             the user name and password that the third party will use to retrieve             the content.\n\n      4.    Tape based abstracts: Tape based abstracts will be handled similar             to FTP pulls except that they would be loaded to tape and sent via             postal service.\n\nAbstracts Only (Headers)\n\n      Some customers want the abstracts only. This will allow bibliographic       database to receive the information in electronic form rather than having       to re-key the documents. Ideally, all databases would also receive       information pointing them to the full text version of the documents. The       directory structure will also be included with this abstract. It is       possible to create a different directory structure and will have to be       handled on an ad-hoc basis.\n\n      This scenario will be completed upon the supply of the final version of       the Blackwell/Munksgaard DTD.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstracts and PDF (Headers and PDF)\n\n      This type of export would use the same DTD as the abstracts only, but       would include a reference to the PDF file inside each header. This extract       would obviously also include the PDF files.\n\nFull Text Blackwell/Munksgaard DTD\n\n      This export will take the Blackwell/Munksgaard SGML files in full as well       as graphic files and PDF files.\n\nFull Text in Ovid's DTD\n\n      This export will convert the full text to Ovid's DTD and includes the       graphic files and PDF files.\n\nDelivery Options for Third Parties\n\n      Third parties will have the option to receive information via HTTP, FTP       (either sent to them or picked up), tape (4mm, 8mm, DLT) or CD-ROM.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Reporting - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      This section defines some of the reports available to       Blackwell/Munksgaard. It is expected that customization of reports will       continue to be refined over the duration of the project.

A provision of this Agreement may be waived only by a written instrument executed by the party waiving compliance.

Failure of either party to exercise promptly any right, power or privilege granted by this Agreement, or to require strict performance of any obligation undertaken by the other party pursuant to this Agreement, will not be deemed to be a waiver of such right, power or privilege or of the right to demand subsequent performance of any and all such obligations undertaken by the other party. 18. Notice. Any notice, request or demand to be made under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly made (a) upon delivery, if delivered personally (by courier service or otherwise), as evidenced by written receipt or other written proof of delivery (which may be a printout of the tracking information of a courier service that made such delivery), or (b) five (5) days after deposit in the mail, if sent by certified or registered mail with return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed to the party for whom intended at the address listed on the signature page.

Remedies. All rights and remedies of either party hereto are cumulative of each other and of every other right or remedy such party may otherwise have at law or in equity, and the exercise of one or more rights or remedies shall not prejudice or impair the concurrent or subsequent exercise of other rights or remedies.

Fees and Expenses. Each party shall be responsible for its own fees and expenses in connection with the preparation and execution of this Agreement. 23. Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for the purposes of convenience only and are not intended to define or limit the contents of this Agreement. 24. Counterparts.

Use of the Miltenyi Products by Bellicum, its Licensees or Subcontractors shall be supervised by a technically qualified individual.\n\n(g) Without limitation to the generality of clauses (a) through (e) above, Bellicum further will not, and will cause its Licensees and Subcontractors not to, without express prior written consent from Miltenyi:\n\n(1) Modify or alter, or cause any Third Party to modify or alter, any Miltenyi Product supplied hereunder other than in connection with its Permitted Use;\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\n(2) Reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise analyze, or cause any Third Party to reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise analyze, any Miltenyi Product supplied hereunder, in whole or in part; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right or ability of Bellicum or its Licensees or Subcontractors to identify defects, troubleshoot problems, evaluate, test, use or conduct any study utilizing any Miltenyi Product(s) as reasonably necessary to achieve the purposes of this Agreement;\n\n(3) Transfer any Miltenyi Product supplied hereunder to any Third Party, except to Bellicum Subcontractors or Licensees solely for the Permitted Use or for training or validation purposes in connection with Bellicum's development and commercialization of Bellicum Product;\n\n(4) Resell Miltenyi Product supplied hereunder to any Third Party, including Bellicum Subcontractors and Licensees, without prior express written permission from Miltenyi; or\n\n(5) Transfer, use, import or export any Miltenyi Product supplied to Bellicum hereunder in any country or territory other than the Designated Countries.\n\n2.3 Additional Countries. Miltenyi acknowledges that Bellicum and/or its Licensees may from time to time desire to use Miltenyi Products in one or more countries that are currently not part of the Designated Countries (each, an \"Additional Country\"). The Parties agree, upon reasonable written request by Bellicum from time to time during the term of this Agreement, to evaluate the regulatory requirements for utilizing of Miltenyi Products for manufacture of Bellicum Products in the requested Additional Country(ies). Based on the assessment of potentially required additional work (\"Additional Work\"), including but not limited to regulatory work pursuant to Section 4.9 as may be required to prepare and file Master Files for Miltenyi Products in support of Bellicum Product filings in such Additional Country(ies), the Parties will negotiate in good faith with the goal of entering into an agreement on mutually acceptable terms with respect to Miltenyi's provision of such Additional Work. Bellicum shall inform Miltenyi in writing at least twelve (12) months in advance prior to any intended regulatory filing in an Additional Country.\n\n2.4 Reserved Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing herein is intended nor shall be construed as creating any exclusive arrangement between Miltenyi and Bellicum with respect to the supply, purchase and/or use of the Miltenyi Products. Miltenyi reserves the right, at its sole discretion and without any restriction or limitation whatsoever, to manufacture, have manufactured, use, have used, sell, have sold, offer for sale, export, import or otherwise commercialize or dispose of Miltenyi Products in any manner and for any purpose whatsoever.\n\n2.5 Subcontracting by Miltenyi. Subject to the terms of the Quality Agreement, if applicable, Miltenyi may, at its sole discretion, upon reasonable prior written notice to Bellicum, elect to have the Miltenyi Products, or any one of them or any component thereof, manufactured by an Affiliate of Miltenyi, and further may subcontract the manufacturing of Miltenyi Product or any component thereof, to a Subcontractor; provided that (i) Miltenyi shall reasonably take into account Bellicum's written concerns regarding proposed Affiliate(s) or Subcontractor(s); and (ii) Miltenyi shall be solely and fully responsible for the performance of all delegated and subcontracted activities by its Affiliates and Subcontractor(s), including compliance with the terms of this Agreement and the Quality Agreement (as applicable), and in no event shall any such delegation or subcontract release Miltenyi from any of its obligations under this Agreement. Miltenyi's Subcontractors and Affiliates for the manufacture and/or supply of Miltenyi Products will be listed in the Quality Agreement\n\n2.6 Compliance.\n\n(a) Miltenyi shall have sole responsibility for ensuring, and shall ensure, that Miltenyi's and its Affiliates' and Subcontractors' activities and performance in connection with the manufacture of Miltenyi Products and the supply of such Miltenyi Products to Bellicum under this Agreement are at all times in compliance with Applicable Laws. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it shall\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nbe the sole responsibility of Miltenyi to obtain and maintain, and Miltenyi shall obtain and maintain, all licenses, permits, authorizations, or registrations required by Applicable Laws in order for Miltenyi, its Affiliates, and/or Subcontractors (as the case may be) to manufacture and make Delivery of Miltenyi Products, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, at Miltenyi's expense.\n\n(b) Bellicum shall have sole responsibility for ensuring, and shall ensure, that the use of the Miltenyi Products for their respective Permitted Use by Bellicum, its Subcontractors and Licensees (as the case may be) is at all times in compliance with Applicable Laws. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it shall be the sole responsibility of Bellicum to obtain and maintain, and Bellicum shall obtain and maintain, all licenses, permits, authorizations, registrations, additional validations or additional testing required by Applicable Laws in order for Bellicum, its Subcontractors and Licensees to use the Miltenyi Products for the Permitted Use, at Bellicum's expense. Miltenyi shall comply with all reasonable requests for assistance by Bellicum in connection with Bellicum's efforts to obtain such licenses, permits, authorizations, registrations, additional validations or additional testing, to the extent applicable to the Miltenyi Products; provided that the Parties shall agree on the scope of such assistance to be provided by Miltenyi and upon the reasonable costs to be paid by Bellicum to Miltenyi for such assistance.\n\n(c) In the event that Bellicum receives notice from a Regulatory Authority raising any issues concerning the safety or quality of any Miltenyi Product, Bellicum shall promptly notify Miltenyi of the same in writing. Upon receipt of such notification, and subject to Miltenyi's obligations set forth in the Quality Agreement, if applicable, in this regard, Miltenyi shall make [...***...] to cure such safety or quality issue(s) as they relate to the Miltenyi Products as promptly as possible, and unless such issues solely relate to Bellicum's Permitted Use of the relevant Miltenyi Product(s) in connection with the manufacture or use of a Bellicum Product, such efforts shall be at Miltenyi's sole expense.\n\n(d) As of the Effective Date and to and through the expiration or termination of this Agreement, each Party represents, warrants and covenants to the other Party that: (1) such Party, and, to its actual knowledge, its owners, directors, officers, employees, and any agent, representative, Subcontractor or other Third Party acting for or on such its behalf, shall not, directly or indirectly, offer, pay, promise to pay, or authorize such offer, promise or payment, of anything of value, to any person for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business through any improper advantage in connection with this Agreement, or that would otherwise violate any Applicable Laws, rules and regulations concerning or relating to public or commercial bribery or corruption; and (2) its financial books, accounts, records and invoices related to this Agreement or related to any work conducted for or on behalf of the other Party are and will be complete and accurate in all material respects. Each Party may request in writing from time to time that the other Party complete a compliance certification regarding the foregoing in this Section 2.6.\n\n2.7 Violations. Nothing herein contained shall oblige Miltenyi to continue supplying, or Bellicum to continue ordering or purchasing, any Miltenyi Product if such supply or purchase is reasonably believed by Miltenyi or Bellicum, as the case may be, based on objective grounds, to violate Applicable Laws or such Party's licenses, or if the Miltenyi Products supplied to Bellicum infringe, or are alleged to infringe, a Third Party's Intellectual Property Rights.\n\n2.8 Transfer of Miltenyi Products. Bellicum shall have the right to transfer Miltenyi Product(s) purchased hereunder, or to request from Miltenyi, by notice in writing, that Miltenyi Deliver any Miltenyi Product(s) purchased hereunder to an Affiliate of Bellicum or a Subcontractor or Licensee of Bellicum Product designated by Bellicum, solely for the purpose of the Permitted Use, subject to the payment to Miltenyi of all additional expenses (if any) incurred by Miltenyi in connection with such provision and transfer of Miltenyi Product(s) to Bellicum's designee; and provided that in each case: (i) each Subcontractor or Licensee of Bellicum to whom Miltenyi Products are transferred shall be bound in writing by limitations and obligations that are consistent with the corresponding limitations and obligations imposed on Bellicum\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nhereunder and under the Quality Agreement, as applicable; and (ii) notwithstanding the transfer of any Miltenyi Product purchased hereunder, Bellicum will nevertheless continue to remain fully and primarily responsible and liable to Miltenyi for payment of the Product Price and for the use of the Miltenyi Product by any Subcontractor and Licensee to whom a Miltenyi Product is transferred.\n\n2.9 Bellicum Licensees.\n\n(a) If and to the extent that Bellicum grants rights with respect to a Bellicum Product under license or other agreement(s) with one or more Licensees of Bellicum, in no event shall Bellicum grant any rights under Miltenyi Intellectual Property Rights other than as expressly permitted hereunder and as are necessary to use Miltenyi Product for the purpose of the Permitted Use, or any rights that are otherwise inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement or the Quality Agreement.\n\n(b) To the extent that the rights granted to Bellicum hereunder (including Bellicum's right to use each Miltenyi Product for its Permitted Use) are shared with one or more of its Subcontractors or Licensees in accordance with the terms hereof, Bellicum shall first impose limitations and obligations on such Subcontractors or Licensees, in writing, that are consistent with the corresponding limitations and obligations imposed on Bellicum hereunder, and Bellicum shall notify Miltenyi of the name and contact information for each such Subcontractor or Licensee that it shares such rights with, in writing, in accordance with Article 16 of this Agreement.\n\n(c) Bellicum shall promptly notify Miltenyi in writing of any additional Licensee contemplating the use of Miltenyi Product(s) for the manufacture of a Bellicum Product from time to time, which Licensee shall be added to the Bellicum Product specific Module by amendment.\n\n(d) At the reasonable written request of Bellicum during the Term, Miltenyi shall enter into a direct supply agreement for Miltenyi Products with any Licensee nominated by Bellicum, materially consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Quality Agreement (as applicable), except as agreed otherwise in writing between Miltenyi and the respective Bellicum Licensee.\n\n2.10 Liability for Non-Compliance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Bellicum shall, in relation to Miltenyi, at all times and in all respects continue to remain fully and primarily responsible and liable to Miltenyi for the performance and the acts or omissions of its Affiliate, Subcontractor, and Licensee in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement, including the failure of an Affiliate, Subcontractor, or Licensee of Bellicum to comply with all of the limitations and obligations imposed on Bellicum hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Miltenyi shall, in relation to Bellicum, at all times and in all respects continue to remain fully and primarily responsible and liable to Bellicum for the performance and the acts or omissions of its Affiliates and Subcontractors in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement, including the failure of an Affiliate or Subcontractor of Miltenyi to comply with all of the limitations and obligations imposed on Miltenyi hereunder. For clarity, in no event shall any permitted delegation or subcontracting of any activities to be performed in connection with this Agreement release a Party from any of its limitations or obligations under this Agreement.\n\n2.11 Governance.\n\n(a) Alliance Managers. Each Party shall appoint an appropriately qualified individual to serve as an alliance manager under this Agreement (the \"Alliance Manager\"). Such persons shall endeavor to assure clear and responsive communication between the Parties and the effective exchange of information, and may serve as the primary point of contact for any matters arising under this Agreement. The Alliance Managers may attend meetings of the JSC, assist in resolving Disputes at the initial level of the Parties' good faith discussions, and may raise issues for discussion by the JSC.\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\n(b) Joint Steering Committee. The Parties hereby establish a joint steering committee (the \"JSC\") that will monitor and provide strategic oversight of the activities under this Agreement, and facilitate communications between the Parties with respect to the supply of Miltenyi Products and Bellicum's development and commercialization of Bellicum Products. Each Party shall initially appoint up to three (3) representatives (or their designees) to the JSC, excluding the Alliance Manager of each Party who will attend JSC meetings in a non- voting capacity. Each such JSC representative of a Party will have sufficient seniority within such Party to make decisions arising within the scope of the JSC's responsibilities. The Parties' initial representatives to the JSC will be provided to each other Party within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date. The JSC may change its size from time to time by mutual consent of its members. Each Party may replace its JSC representatives at any time upon written notice to the other Party; provided, however, that neither Party may replace a representative on the JSC with an individual with lower seniority without the approval of the other Party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The JSC shall meet at least two times each Calendar Year, and at least one such JSC meeting shall be in person/ face-to-face with alternating locations (for in person/ face-to-face meetings only), unless otherwise agreed in writing by both Parties. Each Party may invite up to three (3) of its own employees, and the JSC may invite other non-members, to participate in the discussions and meetings of the JSC, provided that such participants shall have no voting authority at the JSC. The JSC shall have two (2) co- chairpersons, one from each Party. The role of the co-chairpersons shall be to convene and preside at meetings of the JSC. The Alliance Managers shall work with the co-chairpersons to prepare and circulate agendas and to ensure the preparation of minutes. The co- chairpersons shall have no additional powers or rights beyond those held by the other JSC representatives.\n\n(c) Specific Responsibilities of the JSC. In addition to its overall responsibility for monitoring and providing strategic oversight with respect to the Parties' activities under this Agreement, the JSC shall in particular: (i) oversee the collaborative efforts of the Parties under this Agreement; (ii) review and discuss the research, development and commercialization of Miltenyi Products and Bellicum Products, including regulatory matters related thereto; (iii) attempt to resolve Disputes presented by the Alliance Managers; and (iv) perform such other functions as appropriate to further the purposes of this Agreement, in each case, as agreed in writing by the Parties. The JSC has no authority to modify this Agreement, the Quality Agreement or any Module.\n\nARTICLE 3 PRODUCT QUALITY; CHANGE CONTROL\n\n3.1 Product Quality.\n\n(a) Product Specifications. Miltenyi shall manufacture or have manufactured the Miltenyi Products to meet the agreed Product Specifications, as then in effect, as published by Miltenyi from time to time, or as set forth in the Quality Agreement, as applicable.\n\n(b) Agreed Standards. All Miltenyi Products shall be manufactured and quality controlled in compliance with and pursuant to: (i) the Agreed Standards, (ii) the requirements of the Quality Agreement, if applicable, and (iii) Applicable Laws.\n\n(c) Testing. Miltenyi shall have standard analytical testing performed on each batch of Miltenyi Product to be shipped to Bellicum, in accordance with Agreed Standards and the procedures described in the corresponding documentation, to verify that Miltenyi Product meets Product Specifications and that it was manufactured in accordance with Agreed Standards and Applicable Laws.\n\n(d) Quality System. All Miltenyi Products supplied under this Agreement shall be manufactured and quality controlled under an appropriate quality system in accordance with Agreed Standards, as more fully described in the Quality Agreement (as applicable). Any subsequent change to Miltenyi's quality system that, as Bellicum can reasonably establish, would have or is likely to have a material effect on the safety, efficacy, identity and/or quality of a Miltenyi Product or its Permitted Use, requires the Parties to discuss and agree upon each such change in writing.\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\n(e) Quality Agreement. Within [...***...] days from the Effective Date (or such longer period as agreed by the Parties in writing, but in any event prior to the first delivery of Clinical Grade Product to Bellicum), the Parties shall enter into an agreement on mutually acceptable, commercially reasonable terms that details the quality assurance obligations of each Party relating to Clinical Grade Products (the \"Quality Agreement\"). In the event of a conflict between the terms of the Quality Agreement and the terms of this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern; provided, however, that the Quality Agreement shall govern in respect of quality issues.\n\n3.2 Change Control.\n\n(a) General. Subject to the terms and limitations set forth in this Section 3.2 and in the Quality Agreement, and unless otherwise agreed between the Parties in writing from time to time, Miltenyi reserves the right to periodically make changes to the Product Specifications, Agreed Standards and/or otherwise with respect to the properties, manufacture and/or testing of the Miltenyi Products (including changes with respect to: suppliers of raw materials; quality in raw materials; methods of manufacturing; packaging; equipment and/or premises; Subcontractors; product control techniques and methods of analysis; product release specifications; and/or presentation and content of relevant documentation, including certificates pursuant to Section 6.5) from time to time during the Term (each, a \"Change\").\n\n(b) Change Notification. Change notifications shall be provided in accordance with the applicable notification procedures set forth in the Quality Agreement or in this Agreement. In the event that Miltenyi proposes a Material Change, unless such proposed Change is a Required Change pursuant to Section 3.2(c) below and there are compelling reasons for earlier implementation of such Required Change, Miltenyi shall give Bellicum at least [...***...] months' advance written notice prior to implementation of the proposed Material Change (a \"Change Notification\"). Miltenyi shall be responsible for drafting relevant documentation and shall provide to Bellicum all information reasonably necessary for Bellicum to make appropriate filings with the applicable Regulatory Authority regarding any Change under this subsection, if applicable.\n\n(c) Changes Required for Compliance. If during the Term a Change is required to comply with changes in Agreed Standards made by Regulatory Authorities, Applicable Laws and/or other requirements of a Regulatory Authority, or if Miltenyi determines, in its reasonable judgment, that a Change is required to address safety and/or quality issues in regard to the Miltenyi Product generally (in each case, a \"Required Change\"), Miltenyi shall use [...***...] to implement such Required Change at its cost. However, in the event that a Required Change is specifically related to the use of Miltenyi Product for a Permitted Use in relation to a Bellicum Product (a \"Bellicum-Specific Required Change\"), then Miltenyi shall use [...***...] to implement such Bellicum-Specific Required Change only if and to the extent Bellicum agrees to reimburse Miltenyi for all documented costs and expenses reasonably incurred by Miltenyi as a result of any such Bellicum-Specific Required Change. Prior to implementing a Required Change in accordance with this Section 3.2(c), Miltenyi shall promptly advise Bellicum as to any scheduling and/or Product Price adjustments which may result from any such Required Change, if any. Miltenyi and Bellicum shall negotiate in good faith in an attempt to reach agreement on (i) the new Product Price, if any, for any Miltenyi Product which embodies such Required Change, giving due consideration to the effect of such change on Miltenyi's manufacturing costs for the changed Miltenyi Product as well as any other relevant factors, (ii) the responsibility for any costs and expenses associated with Miltenyi's activities required to implement such Change, and (iii) any other amendments to this Agreement which may be necessitated by such Change (e.g., an adjustment to the lead time for firm orders). For clarity, Miltenyi shall have no obligation to implement a Bellicum-Specific Required Change unless and until the Parties have reached agreement on all items as described in the preceding sentence.\n\n(d) Changes Requested by Bellicum. If during the Term Bellicum desires Miltenyi to make any Change not necessary to comply with changes in Agreed Standards made by Regulatory\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nAuthorities, Applicable Laws and/or other requirements of Regulatory Authorities (in each case, a \"Bellicum-Requested Change\"), Bellicum shall notify Miltenyi thereof in writing. Implementation of any such proposed Bellicum-Requested Change shall be subject to Miltenyi's consent. Miltenyi may withhold its consent to an Bellicum-Requested Change if Miltenyi reasonably determines that such change (i) does not comply with Agreed Standards, Applicable Laws or the requirements of Miltenyi's applicable Regulatory Authority, or (ii) could have potential adverse impact on Miltenyi's manufacturing activities or the sale of the respective Miltenyi Product to other customers. In addition, a Bellicum-Requested Change shall only be implemented following a technical and cost review which shall be conducted as promptly as is reasonably possible and in good faith by Miltenyi, at Bellicum's cost, and shall be subject to Miltenyi and Bellicum reaching agreement as to the one-time costs and revisions to the Product Price necessitated by any such Bellicum-Requested Change. If Bellicum agrees to reimburse Miltenyi for all documented costs and expenses reasonably incurred by Miltenyi as a result of the proposed Bellicum- Requested Change and accepts a proposed Product Price adjustment that reflects a change in Miltenyi manufacturing costs resulting from such Bellicum-Requested Change, Miltenyi shall use [...***...] to implement the proposed Bellicum-Requested Change. For clarity, an agreed adjustment to the Product Price shall become effective only with respect to orders for Miltenyi Products that are manufactured in accordance with the Bellicum-Requested Change.\n\n(e) Changes Requested by Miltenyi. If during the Term Miltenyi wishes to make any Material Change not necessary to comply with changes in Agreed Standards made by Regulatory Authorities, Applicable Laws or other requirements of Regulatory Authorities (in each case, a \"Miltenyi-Requested Change\"), Miltenyi shall notify Bellicum in accordance with the Change Notification procedures set forth in Section 3.2(b) and the Quality Agreement before implementation of such Miltenyi-Requested Change (including at least 6 months advance written notice prior to implementation), and shall keep Bellicum advised of its efforts to effectuate such change. Miltenyi shall use its best efforts to provide to Bellicum with a commercially reaosnable number of samples of the \"Changed Miltenyi Product\" (meaning such Miltenyi Product that is produced under conditions of the Miltenyi-Requested Change) for evaluation by Bellicum as soon as such Changed Miltenyi Product becomes available during the post-noficiation period. Miltenyi shall be responsible for drafting relevant documentation and shall provide to Bellicum any information reasonably necessary for Bellicum to make appropriate filings with the applicable Regulatory Authority for Bellicum to obtain any required amendment or other modification of the Bellicum Product regulatory approvals regarding changes under this subsection, if applicable. Miltenyi shall implement such Miltenyi-Requested Change at its own cost and expense. If Bellicum does not agree that such Changed Miltenyi Product is acceptable from Bellicum's perspective, then any limitations on or obligations of Bellicum under Article 5 pertaining to forecast variances and Firm Zone ordering in relation to Miltenyi Products affected by such Miltenyi-Requested Change shall not apply, and therefore Bellicum has no obligation to purchase any such Changed Miltenyi Products.\n\n(f) Cooperation. In connection with any Change pursuant to this Section 3.2, the Parties shall cooperate, share information, and otherwise act in good faith to prepare the appropriate documentation as may be necessary to secure and maintain appropriate regulatory approvals or manufacturing permits for Miltenyi Product and Bellicum Product, respectively.\n\n(g) Continued Supply. Except in the event of a Required Change, or other circumstances requiring the prompt implementation of a proposed Material Change (as such circumstances and prompt implementation are notified to Bellicum in writing and if requested by Bellicum, discussed with Bellicum in good faith), Miltenyi shall continue to supply Miltenyi Product without the proposed Material Change for as long a period as is reasonably required for Bellicum, using [...***...], to make all appropriate filings and obtain any required amendment or modification of existing regulatory approvals for Bellicum Product (unless otherwise agreed, such period not to exceed six (6) months from the date of implementation of the Material Change as provided in Miltenyi's Change Notification pursuant to Section 3.2(b)), subject to the Parties reaching agreement, as to the one-time costs and revisions to the Product\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nPrice necessitated by any such continued supply of unchanged Miltenyi Product during such period. Until such agreement is reached, any limitations on or obligations of Bellicum under Article 5 pertaining to forecast variances and Firm Zone ordering in relation to Miltenyi Products described in this subsection (g) shall not apply, and therefore Bellicum has no obligation to purchase any such Miltenyi Products produced after implementation of such Material Change. If the continued supply of unchanged Miltenyi Product under this subsection (g) is reasonably estimated by the Parties to exceed a period of six (6) months from the implementation date of the Material Change notified in a Change Notification pursuant to Section 3.2(b), then the Parties shall promptly meet to discuss in good faith how to remedy the situation.\n\n(h) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (e) and (g), in the event that Bellicum reasonably determines to reject a proposed Material Change (including a Miltenyi-Requested Change), Miltenyi will continue to supply the applicable Miltenyi Product without such change after expiry of the said 6-month period and during the Term of this Agreement, or until Bellicum has secured an alternate source of supply from a Third Party manufacturer; provided, however, that the Parties will discuss in good faith, reflecting the change in circumstances contemplated by this Section 3.2(h), and agree in writing upon commercially reasonable terms to be set forth in an amendment to this Agreement to reflect any demonstrable increased cost and effort (if any) resulting from the manufacture of unchanged Miltenyi Product solely for Bellicum, including (as an example) any applicable adjustments to Forecasts, Lead Times, production cycles, batch sizes, Delivery Dates, Product Prices, or other relevant issues. If the Parties cannot reach agreement regarding such amendment, any obligations of Bellicum in relation to a Forecast for the affected Miltentyi Product in months 7-12 of the applicable Monthly Forecast, and any limitations regarding forecast variances, as each of these are set forth in Article 5, will not apply to a Miltenyi Product produced after implementation of such Material Change (i.e., one that replaces such affected (unchanged) Miltenyi Product), and Miltenyi shall be relieved from any obligations to supply such affected (unchanged) Miltenyi Product under this Agreement after the period described in the first sentence of this subsection (h) ends. For clarity, in no event shall Miltenyi be required to manufacture, supply or sell an existing Miltenyi Product to which a Required Change must be applied.\n\n(i) Research Grade Products. The notification requirements of the second sentence of Section 3.2(b) of this Agreement with respect to Material Changes and the obligations of Section 3.2(g) with respect to Continued Supply shall not apply to Research Grade Products.\n\n(j) Costs. Bellicum shall have responsibility for any Regulatory Authority filing fees and other costs and expenses incurred by Bellicum in connection with any filing or required amendment or other modification of regulatory approvals or consents for Bellicum Product resulting from any Change pursuant this Section 3.2, if applicable.\n\nARTICLE 4 REGULATORY\n\n4.1 Regulatory Responsibility.\n\n(a) Bellicum Product(s). Subject to responsibilities pertaining to Miltenyi Products that are solely reserved by Miltenyi under this Agreement, and subject to the provisions in this Article 4 (including Section 4.7), Bellicum will be solely responsible for all regulatory activities with respect to any Bellicum Product, including the manufacture and quality control thereof.\n\n(b) Miltenyi Product(s). Subject to responsibilities pertaining to Bellicum Product(s) that are solely reserved by Bellicum under this Agreement, and subject to the provisions in this Article 4 (including Section 4.7), Miltenyi will be solely responsible for all regulatory activities with respect to any Miltenyi Product, including the manufacture and quality control thereof.\n\n(c) Disclaimer. Bellicum hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except as specifically set out with respect to any Miltenyi Product in the Product Specifications or in the Quality Agreement, as\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\napplicable, the Miltenyi Products have no approvals by Regulatory Authorities in the Territory for use in diagnostic or therapeutic procedures or other clinical applications, or for any other use requiring compliance with any law or regulation regulating clinical, diagnostic or therapeutic products or any similar product (hereinafter collectively referred to as \"Regulatory Laws\"). Bellicum further acknowledges and agrees that Miltenyi Products have not yet been fully tested or validated for safety or effectiveness in connection with Bellicum's Permitted Use. Save as set out in the Product Specifications or the applicable Quality Agreement, it shall be the sole responsibility of Bellicum to test and validate the Miltenyi Products for Bellicum's contemplated Permitted Use hereunder and to take all other actions necessary to establish compliance of Bellicum's Permitted Use thereof with all regulatory requirements, and to ensure that any Bellicum Product resulting from such Permitted Use meets all applicable safety, quality, or other regulatory requirements (including Regulatory Laws), in each case prior to the first use of such Miltenyi Product.\n\n(d) The Miltenyi Products supplied hereunder may not be used for any purpose that would require Regulatory Authority approvals or consents unless such proper Regulatory Authority approvals or consents have been obtained. Bellicum agrees that if it elects to use, or causes any Bellicum Subcontractor or Licensee to use, any Miltenyi Products for a purpose that would subject Miltenyi or such Miltenyi Products to the jurisdiction of any Regulatory Laws, Bellicum will be solely responsible for obtaining any required Regulatory Authority approvals or consents, and for otherwise ensuring that Bellicum's (or its Subcontractors' or Licensees') use of such Miltenyi Products for such purpose complies with such Regulatory Laws. Bellicum shall defend and indemnify Miltenyi and its Affiliates against any liability, damage, loss or expense resulting from or arising out of Bellicum's failure to obtain all necessary Regulatory Authority approvals or consents or to comply with any Regulatory Laws in relation to Bellicum's use of such Miltenyi Products for such purpose.\n\n4.2 Regulatory Authority Requirements. Miltenyi states that (i) Miltenyi is obliged by relevant Regulatory Authorities to keep a record of all of its customer's clinical trials that use Miltenyi Products (name and title of clinical trials, the official registration numbers, name and addresses of the involved principal investigators and clinical trial centers as well as the corresponding formal document granting approval of an IND (for example only, IND/CTA acknowledgement letter of the relevant Regulatory Authority(ies) involving the use of \"IDE/CRR\"- labelled Miltenyi Products)) (regardless of whether such clinical trials are sponsored by Miltenyi or by any Third Party); and (ii) Miltenyi is not permitted to provide \"IDE/CRR\"-labeled Miltenyi Products to customers in the United States for use in clinical trials if the IND or IDE is not approved by the respective regulatory authority or rejected. . Miltenyi shall act and shall have no liability to Bellicum for acting in accordance with the foregoing requirements. As used herein, \"CTA\" means a clinical trial application; \"IDE\" means an investigational device exemption; and \"IDE/CRR\" references a certain subset of Miltenyi Products labeled with the \"IDE/CRR\" designation.\n\n4.3 Regulatory Work. Miltenyi has established, or may from time to time establish, Master Files for one or more Miltenyi Products with one or more Regulatory Authorities in the Territory. Miltenyi shall maintain each such Master File in accordance with Applicable Laws (\"Regulatory Work\"). To the extent Bellicum requests that Miltenyi generate any additional Master File and/or add additional information to any existing Master File, the provisions of Section 4.4 \"Extension of Scope, Supplemental Services\" below shall apply.\n\n4.4 Extension of Scope, Supplemental Services. With respect to any Bellicum Product, Bellicum may request that Miltenyi provide additional regulatory assistance beyond the scope of the Regulatory Work, and/or may request that Miltenyi perform additional services (i.e. generation of additional supportive data for inclusion in a Master File) that alter, amend, or add to the Regulatory Work. Bellicum shall submit each such request to Miltenyi with reasonable detail in writing. Any request that constitutes a material modification or increase in scope of the Regulatory Work or an agreement for the provision of additional services shall require a written amendment to this Agreement via the Bellicum Product- or Bellicum Program-specific Module signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. Such amendment\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nshall specify in detail any modification or scope change of the Regulatory Work performed by Miltenyi, the appropriate compensation (if any) or basis for such compensation to be paid to Miltenyi by Bellicum for the performance of such additional Regulatory Work assistance or services, and the appropriate time schedule for completion of such additional Regulatory Work assistance or services. Upon executing such written amendment, the additional Regulatory Work assistance or services shall be deemed included within Regulatory Work and subject to the standards of performance described in this Agreement.\n\n4.5 Master Files; Right to Cross Reference. Upon Bellicum's written request, subject to Section 4.9, Miltenyi shall submit a cross reference letter to the appropriate Regulatory Authority(ies) in any Designated Country in which Miltenyi maintains a Master File(s) for the relevant Miltenyi Product(s), authorizing such Regulatory Authority(ies) to access and refer to such Master File(s) for the relevant Miltenyi Product(s) to the extent such information is reasonably required for regulatory purposes to obtain the applicable regulatory approvals for the Permitted Use of the Miltenyi Product(s) and/or the Bellicum Product(s); provided, however, that Bellicum shall first provide to Miltenyi all necessary information about such Bellicum Product that is reasonably included in such cross reference letter.\n\n4.6 Rights to Master Files. Miltenyi shall solely own and retain all rights, title and interest in and to the Master File(s) (and any pertaining regulatory documentation). Bellicum shall have no right to access the Master File(s), or, except as expressly set forth in Section 4.5 supra, to require the disclosure by Miltenyi of any information contained in any Master File, or to cross-reference or otherwise use the Master File(s) for any purpose other than as expressly provided herein.\n\n4.7 Communication to/from Regulatory Authorities.\n\n(a) Communication from Regulatory Authorities. Each Party will promptly notify the other Party in writing of any material communication from any Regulatory Authority that is related specifically to (i) the safety and/or functionality of any Miltenyi Product(s) and/or the use thereof for the manufacture of Bellicum Product or (ii) the safety and/or functionality of any Bellicum Product(s) as the same relate or could relate to a Miltenyi Product and/or the use of Miltenyi Product(s) in the manufacture of Bellicum Product(s), and that would, in each case of (i) and (ii), reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on either Party's products that are the subject matter of this Agreement, or ability of a Party to comply with its obligations under this Agreement (collectively, \"Communication(s)\"). Each Party shall, as soon as practicable after any contact with or receipt of any Communication, forward a copy or description of the same (to the extent it so relates) to the other Party. Each Party reserves the right to redact its Confidential Information and confidential Third Party information from such Communications. Each Party shall obligate its Affiliates and Subcontractors accordingly.\n\n(b) Communication to Regulatory Authorities. In the event that a response to a Regulatory Authority is required in connection with any Communication, Bellicum will have sole responsibility for the form and content of any response to a Communication from a Regulatory Authority in connection with any regulatory submission regarding a Bellicum Product, or any non-Miltenyi Product component thereof (Miltenyi will provide its proposed response regarding any Miltenyi Product component thereof), and any non-product-specific information and/or non-procedure-specific information related to Bellicum, and Miltenyi will have sole responsibility for the form and content of any response to a Communication from a Regulatory Authority regarding a Miltenyi Product regulatory submission or any component thereof, the Master Files, and any non-product specific information related to Miltenyi. If Miltenyi's response is requested and needed in connection with any Bellicum Product regulatory submission, and a delayed response is likely to delay development or commercialization of such Bellicum Product, then Miltenyi will promptly use its diligent efforts to provide such response as soon as practicable. At the responding Party's reasonable request and expense, the other Party will collaborate in good faith with the responding Party in preparing such responses and, subject to Sections 4.5 and 4.6, will provide the responding\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nParty with information that the responding Party reasonably believes is required to develop a requested response for questions in relation to such Communication.\n\n(c) Required Communications. If Bellicum is required to communicate with any Regulatory Authority specifically regarding any Miltenyi Product, then Bellicum shall so advise Miltenyi as soon as practicable and, unless prohibited by Applicable Law, or to the extent that such a disclosure would result in the violation of any contractual obligations to a Third Party, provide Miltenyi in advance with a copy of any proposed written Communication with such Regulatory Authority to the extent that such Communication pertains to Miltenyi Products; provided that Bellicum reserves the right to redact its Confidential Information and confidential Third Party information from such copy. Bellicum shall use reasonable efforts to comply with all reasonable direction of Miltenyi pertaining to the foregoing. To the extent permitted by the Regulatory Authority, Miltenyi shall have the right to participate in any planned oral Communications or meetings between Bellicum and any Regulatory Authority specifically relating to Miltenyi Products or Miltenyi Technology. For purposes of clarification, the obligations imposed on Bellicum pursuant to this Section 4.7(c) shall not apply with respect to Communications with Regulatory Authorities that are focused primarily on a non-Miltenyi Product portions or on a Bellicum Product.\n\n4.8 Assistance. Miltenyi shall, if requested by Bellicum, consult with and provide reasonable assistance to Bellicum with regard to regulatory matters concerning the Miltenyi Products, as appropriate, provided that for any assistance regarding regulatory matters that is beyond the scope of standard use of the Miltenyi Products as made available in Miltenyi's catalogue, Bellicum shall pay for Miltenyi's time for such consulting and assistance at Miltenyi's then-standard rates, which scope and limits shall be discussed between the Parties and mutually agreed in writing prior to the performance of the assistance by Miltenyi (subject to the Parties' representations, warranties and liabilities under this Agreement). Absent Miltenyi's gross negligence or willful misconduct, Bellicum shall bear all responsibility for Bellicum's or Bellicum Subcontractors' use of information provided by Miltenyi (including use in regulatory filings and any Third Party liability) pursuant to this Section 4.8.\n\n4.9 Additional Filings. Bellicum acknowledges that, as of the Effective Date, Master Files in relation to Miltenyi's supply obligations have not been filed in all jurisdictions worldwide. If Bellicum desires to pursue clinical evaluations related to the approvability or approval of any Bellicum Product or decides to pursue commercialization of any Bellicum Product in any jurisdiction where Miltenyi does not then have an active Master File, and Bellicum would not legally be able to conduct such evaluation or commercialization without Miltenyi filing a Master File in such jurisdiction or making necessary information available to the Regulatory Authority, then Bellicum shall so notify Miltenyi, and the Parties shall discuss in good faith the terms and conditions under which Miltenyi would be willing to file such Master File or provide necessary information to the Regulatory Authority including additional compensation to Miltenyi (if any), but Miltenyi shall not be obligated to file such Master File or provide such information, unless the Parties mutually agree in writing on such commercially reasonable terms and conditions. To the extent requested by Bellicum in writing from time to time to amend the Bellicum Product specific Module to include Additional Countries, Miltenyi shall work in good faith with Bellicum to include such Additional Countries in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.3 supra.\n\n4.10 Disclaimer. Except as provided in this Article 4 or otherwise in the Agreement, Miltenyi provides no warranty that any Master File or other regulatory dossier or submission by Miltenyi or Bellicum will be approved by any Regulatory Authority. Miltenyi shall in no way be held responsible for any refusal by any Regulatory Authority or ethics committee to grant permission to conduct a clinical trial(s) and/or for any refusal by any Regulatory Authority to grant approval under an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) or under a Biological License Application (BLA) or for compassionate use for a Bellicum Product.\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nARTICLE 5 FORECASTS AND ORDERS\n\n5.1 Forecasts. In order to assist Miltenyi with its capacity, procurement and production planning, and as a general framework for forecasting Bellicum's orders of Miltenyi Products (where more specific parameters may be set forth in a given Module), Bellicum agrees to provide Miltenyi with rolling forecasts of Bellicum's (and its Subcontractors' and Licensees') anticipated quantity requirements for Miltenyi Products in the Forecast Territory during the Term of this Agreement, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.1 (each, a \"Forecast\"). There is no binding forecasting obligation for Research Grade Products, except (if applicable) as otherwise explicitly agreed in a Module. Any modified forecasting terms and conditions for a particular Bellicum Product or Bellicum Program that supplement this Article 5 will be set forth in the Module applicable to that Bellicum Product or Bellicum Program. All of the Forecasts provided under this Agreement will break down the demand of Miltenyi Products on a product-by-product (expressed in number of units) and manufacturing country-by-manufacturing country basis (i.e., Forecast Territory only) and substantially follow the mutually agreed Miltenyi forecast sheet, as attached hereto in Exhibit C 1-3. All Forecasts provided by Bellicum will be good faith estimates of Bellicum's anticipated quantity requirements for Miltenyi Products during the relevant period. Bellicum agrees to use [...***...] in preparing all Forecasts provided hereunder to minimize variances between Forecasts. Each Forecast shall be duly signed by an authorized representative of Bellicum (or Bellicum's designee on behalf of Bellicum) and submitted in writing to Miltenyi, by mail, email or facsimile, and shall supersede prior Forecasts to the extent the Forecast overlaps with prior Forecasts.\n\n(a) Rolling Monthly Forecast; Firm Zone. Within [...***...] Business Days of the Effective Date, and thereafter by the [...***...] day of each Calendar Month during the Term, Bellicum shall submit a monthly rolling Forecast of Bellicum's anticipated quantity requirements for Miltenyi Products within the Forecast Territory (on a manufacturing country-by-manufacturing country basis) for each of the next twelve (12) consecutive Calendar Months (e.g., year 1: months 1-12), commencing with the Calendar Month in which such Forecast is submitted (each, a \"Monthly Forecast\"). (For clarity, the initial Monthly Forecast will cover Calendar Year 1, i.e., Calendar Months 1-12; the following Monthly Forecast will cover the twelve Calendar Months period following the Calendar Month 1 of the previous Monthly Forecast, i.e., Calendar Months 2-13.) The Monthly Forecast shall show quantities forecasted on a monthly basis, and for the first (1st) three (3) months shall state the desired dates of Delivery for the forecasted quantities. With respect to any Monthly Forecast for Miltenyi Products submitted during the Term, [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) of the quantities forecasted for the first (1st) three (3) month period of each Monthly Forecast (each such 3-month period will be referred to as the \"Firm Zone\") shall be binding, and the corresponding portion of each subsequent Monthly Forecast shall be consistent with such period. For clarity, all forecasted quantities of Miltenyi Products during the Firm Zone shall constitute a binding commitment by Bellicum to submit corresponding Purchase Orders for Miltenyi Products. The Parties agree that, except with respect to the Firm Zone and any additional conditions set forth in a given Module, a Monthly Forecast provided by Bellicum will not be binding upon both Parties.\n\n(b) Rolling Quarterly Forecast. Within [...***...] Business Days of the Effective Date, and thereafter by the [...***...] day of each last month of a Calendar Quarter during the Term, Bellicum shall submit a non-binding quarterly rolling Forecast of Bellicum's anticipated quantity requirements for Miltenyi Products for each of the four (4) Calendar Quarters immediately following the last month of such Calendar Quarter (each, a \"Quarterly Forecast\"). Each Quarterly Forecast shall show anticipated quantity requirements on a quarterly basis. (For clarity, the initial Quarterly Forecast will cover Calendar Year 2, i.e. Calendar Quarters 1, 2, 3 and 4 (covering Calendar Months 13-15, 16-18, 19-21 and 22-24); the following Quarterly Forecast will cover the four Calendar Quarter period following the Calendar Quarter 1 of the previous Quarterly Forecast, i.e. Calendar Quarters 2-5.) A Quarterly Forecast provided by Bellicum will not be binding upon both Parties.\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\n(c) Long-Term Forecast. In addition, Bellicum (or Bellicum's designee on behalf of Bellicum) shall within [...***...] days of the Effective Date, and thereafter by [...***...] of each Calendar Year during the Term, submit a non-binding annual rolling Forecast of Bellicum's anticipated quantity requirements for Miltenyi Products for each of the next three (3) consecutive Calendar Years, commencing with the Calendar Year in which such Forecast is submitted (each, a \"Long-Term Forecast\") for the purposes of assisting Miltenyi with its capacity and production planning for Miltenyi Products during such period. Each Long-Term Forecast shall show anticipated quantity requirements on an annual basis. (For clarity, the initial Long-Term Forecast will cover the Calendar Years 3 to 5; the following Long-Term Forecast will cover the Calendar Years period following the previous Calendar Year 3 of the previous Long-Term Forecast, i.e. Calendar Years 4-5.) A Long Term Forecast provided by Bellicum will not be binding upon both Parties and shall serve to assess future capacity planning at Miltenyi.\n\n(d) Forecasts Due Periodically. In the event that Miltenyi has failed to receive an updated Forecast for any relevant forecast period within the times or by the dates provided in clauses (a) through (c) above, Miltenyi shall promptly notify Bellicum of such failure in writing and, if Bellicum fails to respond with an updated Forecast by the [...***...] day of a Calendar Month of the relevant forecast period, the most recent Forecast shall be regarded as current.\n\n(e) Acceptable Forecast Variance. Outside the Firm Zone, Bellicum may increase or decrease the amount of Miltenyi Product forecast for each Calendar Month of each Monthly Forecast by up to [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) for Calendar Months 4 through 6, and by [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) for Calendar Months 7 through 12, compared to the amount of Miltenyi Product that was forecast for the comparable Calendar Month in the prior Monthly Forecast provided in accordance with this Agreement, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, (e.g., the forecast for the fourth Calendar Month in a Monthly Forecast may not increase or decrease by more than [...***...]% of the amount of any particular Miltenyi Product in any particular country forecast for the fifth Calendar Month of the prior Monthly Forecast). For clarity, variances with respect to forecasts submitted for any Calendar Month within the Firm Zone shall not be acceptable.\n\n5.2 Volume Limitations.\n\n(a) Subject to Bellicum's adherence to its Forecast obligations pursuant to Section 5.1 above, or as specifically modified in a specific Module, Miltenyi shall meet the demands of any Purchase Orders (as defined below) that are made by Bellicum in compliance with the Forecasts. Miltenyi shall not be obligated to supply Bellicum with quantities of Miltenyi Product in excess of [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) of the most recent Forecast provided to Miltenyi but agrees to use [...***...] to satisfy Bellicum's requirement of Miltenyi Product in excess of [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) of the relevant Forecast quantities in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\n\n(b) In the event that Miltenyi becomes aware that it is or will be unable to supply any desired quantity of Miltenyi Product pursuant to a Purchase Order that falls within the relevant Forecast on or before the applicable Delivery date(s) therefor, Miltenyi shall promptly inform Bellicum, and then, the Parties shall, in good faith, seek to agree on a revised date (or dates) for Delivery. If Miltenyi fails to propose a reasonably acceptable plan for the Delivery, Bellicum may, to be determined in Bellicum's reasonable discretion and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, at its option, cancel the Purchase Order.\n\n5.3 Firm Zone Requirements. Unless otherwise set forth in a relevant Module, the quantity of Miltenyi Product(s) forecasted for each Calendar Month of the Firm Zone of the most recent rolling Monthly Forecast submitted pursuant to Section 5.1(a) of this Agreement shall be binding on both Parties, commencing on the Effecctive Date of the Agreement (but not for the first three months thereto), and in each Calendar Month during the Term, Bellicum shall have the firm obligation to order at a minimum the amount of Miltenyi Product(s) specified for the first (1st) Calendar Month of the most recent rolling Monthly Forecast\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\n(such amount, the \"Firm Zone Requirements\"). The Firm Zone Requirement shall not apply within the first three months of the Effective Date of the Agreement. Within [...***...] days of the end of each Calendar Quarter, Miltenyi will calculate the total Firm Zone Requirements for each of the three (3) Calendar Months during that Calendar Quarter. In the event that Bellicum fails to order the Firm Zone Requirements of Miltenyi Product from Miltenyi during any particular Calendar Month in the relevant Calendar Quarter in which Miltenyi was ready, willing and able to Deliver Miltenyi Product in accordance with the applicable Monthly Forecast, then the \"Firm Zone Order Shortfall\" shall be the total amount by which the Firm Zone Requirements for any given Calendar Month during such Calendar Quarter exceed the amount of Miltenyi Product actually ordered by Bellicum during such Calendar Month. Miltenyi will invoice Bellicum for an amount equal to the Firm Zone Shortfall and Bellicum will pay such invoice within [...***...] days of the invoice date. Upon Bellicum's request and subject to payment of the Firm Zone Shortfall amount by Bellicum, Miltenyi will, if so requested by Bellicum, provide Bellicum with Miltenyi's remaining stock of the relevant forecasted Miltenyi Products equal in value to such Firm Zone Shortfall amount.\n\n5.4 Purchase Orders. This Section 5.4 sets forth a general framework for Purchase Order-related terms and conditions, which shall apply unless modified terms and conditions for a particular Bellicum Product are set forth in its corresponding Module.\n\n(a) Bellicum shall order Miltenyi Products by submitting written purchase orders to Miltenyi, in such form as the Parties may agree from time to time and in accordance with any applicable Lead Times and the provisions of this Article 5 (each, a \"Purchase Order\"). All Purchase Orders (and any related acceptances or objections by Miltenyi) may be delivered electronically or by other means to Miltenyi's applicable sales representative located in the country of the shipping destination or to such location as Miltenyi shall reasonably designate from time to time.\n\n(b) Each Purchase Order will specify the MB Global Contract Number assigned to this Agreement, the volumes of Miltenyi Product(s) ordered, the desired Delivery date(s) the Miltenyi Products are to be made available to Bellicum for pick-up by Bellicum's designated carrier or freight forwarder, the relevant ship-to address, and any special shipping instructions. Bellicum will order Miltenyi Product in a defined number of units, subject to reasonable minimum order size requirements that may vary according to product type.\n\n(c) Bellicum shall submit each Purchase Order to Miltenyi reasonably prior to the desired Delivery date(s), which shall be no sooner than the applicable Lead Time(s) for the relevant Miltenyi Product(s); provided that absent an applicable Lead Time, the Purchase Order shall be submitted at least [...***...] days in advance of the desired Delivery date specified in such Purchase Order; and provided further that Miltenyi shall use diligent and good faith efforts to Deliver before the desiredDelivery date.\n\n(d) Purchase Orders shall be firm and binding upon written acceptance by Miltenyi. Miltenyi shall confirm acceptance of the Purchase Order by written notice (sent by fax, mail, overnight courier or e-mail) to Bellicum within [...***...] Business Days of receipt of the Purchase Order from Bellicum. If Miltenyi fails to confirm acceptance of a Purchase Order within [...***...] Business Days of receipt of the Purchase Order from Bellicum, then Bellicum will contact Miltenyi to verify Miltenyi's receipt and acceptance of such Purchase Order and request written confirmation thereof from Miltenyi. Miltenyi shall accept all Purchase Orders for quantities of Miltenyi Product that are within the Firm Zone Requirement amounts specified for the relevant Calendar Month in the applicable Monthly Forecast.\n\n(e) Each Purchase Order shall reference the MB Global Contract Reference Number (MBGCR) defined in the respective Modules, submitted by Bellicum to Miltenyi shall be governed exclusively by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the relevant Module and the applicable Quality Agreement. None of the terms and conditions set forth on any Purchase Order, order form, invoice, acceptance, objection or similar document shall change or modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and the Parties hereby agree that the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the relevant Module shall\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nsupersede any conflicting term or condition set forth in any Purchase Order, order form, invoice, acceptance, objection or similar document furnished by Bellicum to Miltenyi or by Miltenyi to Bellicum, as the case may be. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchase Orders may only contain products to be ordered under a single MBGCR. The combination of products referring to different MBGCR in one Purchase Order, or a combination of products referencing a MBGCR and products not referencing a MBGCR in one Purchase Order is not possible.\n\n(f) In the event of a Bellicum Product safety issue, withdrawal or hold on use of a Bellicum Product by a Regulatory Authority or other issue that directly results in a material reduction or elimination of Bellicum's quantity requirements for a particular Miltenyi Product(s), the Parties will discuss promptly and in good faith adjustments to the permitted forecast variance described in Section 5.1(e) during the period when such circumstance exists, and other steps that could be taken to soften the impact of such circumstance on each Party.\n\n5.5 Changes to Purchase Orders. Subject to Section 5.2 and applicable Lead Times, Miltenyi shall use [...***...] to comply with unplanned changes in Purchase Orders requested by Bellicum either in terms of quantities or Delivery dates. All requests for changes to Purchase Orders shall be submitted in writing. Bellicum shall be responsible for all supplementary costs that result from the implementation of any unplanned change to an accepted Purchase Order requested by Bellicum.\n\n5.6 Minimum Purchases. This Section 5.6 sets forth a general framework for Minimum Purchases-related terms and conditions, which shall apply unless modified terms and conditions for a particular Bellicum Product are set forth in its corresponding Module. In the event Bellicum's aggregate purchases of Miltenyi Products from Miltenyi under this Agreement in any Calendar Year during the Term is less than [...***...]% of the Rolling Monthly Forecast subject to Sections 5.1 and 5.3, at the beginning of that Calendar Year or \u20ac[...***...] ([...***...] Euros), whatever is higher, (the \"Minimum Purchase\"), then Miltenyi shall provide written notice to Bellicum of such shortfall. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, and for Calendar Year 2019 only, the \u20ac[...***...] amount recited as an element used to determine the Minimum Purchase in a Calendar Year is hereby reduced to \u20ac[...***...]. Bellicum shall have [...***...] days to tender a firm Purchase Order for the purchase of such shortfall to satisfy the Minimum Purchase requirements set forth above. If Bellicum fails to tender such firm Purchase Order and has not otherwise met the Minimum Purchase requirements within said [...***...]-day period, then Miltenyi, in its sole discretion, effective immediately upon Bellicum's receipt of written notice of Miltenyi's election to do so, shall have no obligation to Bellicum under this Agreement:\n\n(1) not to discontinue the supply of any particular Miltenyi Product;\n\n(2) to use [...***...] to ensure continuous supply of Miltenyi Products to Bellicum in accordance with Forecasts provided by or on behalf of Bellicum; and\n\n(3) to provide Regulatory Work in accordance with Section 4.3.\n\nMinimum Purchases referred to above will include the quantities of Miltenyi Product(s) ordered by Bellicum in accordance with applicable Forecasts that could not be supplied by Miltenyi. At the time Bellicum reaches the Minimum Purchase requirements again, Miltenyi and Bellicum shall in good faith agree to continue the supply commitment.\n\nARTICLE 6 DELIVERY\n\n6.1 Delivery; Shipment.\n\n(a) Each quantity of Miltenyi Product(s) ordered by Bellicum in a particular Purchase Order pursuant to this Agreement shall be delivered FCA (Incoterms 2010) Miltenyi's Facility by delivery\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nof the shipped goods to Bellicum's designated carrier or freight forwarder, in adequate packaging and ready for loading, on the Delivery Date (\"Delivery\").\n\n(b) Each shipment of Miltenyi Products will be picked up by Bellicum's designated carrier on the agreed delivery date(s) (each, a \"Delivery Date\") confirmed by Miltenyi for the applicable Purchase Order in accordance with applicable Lead Time(s), during normal business hours (Monday to Friday, excluding statutory holidays) unless special arrangements are agreed to by Miltenyi in writing. Bellicum shall be responsible for all arrangements regarding loading, shipment, insurance from Miltenyi's Facility to the ultimate destination and import customs clearances at the destination country, except as otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing. Alternatively, upon Bellicum's written request, Miltenyi will make all necessary shipping arrangements on behalf of Bellicum with a carrier designated by Bellicum, on Bellicum's responsibility. Bellicum shall provide Miltenyi with a list of approved carriers. Bellicum also shall be responsible for all of the following costs and charges, as applicable: loading charges of the designated carrier, freight charges and other shipping expenses from Miltenyi's Facility to the ultimate destination, expenses for insurance of goods during transit, import customs clearances.\n\n(c) Upon Delivery, Bellicum will cause its carrier to verify the gross and visually observable physical integrity of all Miltenyi Product packaging prior to loading and to acknowledge proper receipt of the Miltenyi Products by signing the relevant transport documentation.\n\n(d) Miltenyi shall have the Miltenyi Products appropriately labelled with a traceable lot or batch number and packaged for shipping in commercial packaging materials in compliance with Agreed Standards, Miltenyi's standard procedures and, the applicable Quality Agreement.\n\n(e) Quantities actually Delivered to Bellicum or Bellicum's designee pursuant to an accepted Purchase Order may not vary from the quantities reflected in such Purchase Order without Bellicums' prior written consent; provided, however, that if Bellicum so consents to a variance in quantities actually Delivered (as compared to quantities set forth in an accepted Purchase Order), Bellicum shall only be invoiced and required to pay for the quantities of Miltenyi Product that Miltenyi actually Delivered to Bellicum or Bellicum's designee. In the event that Bellicum consents to accept Delivery of less than the quantities of Miltenyi Product in an accepted Purchase Order, Miltenyi shall include, in the next shipment of Miltenyi Product to Bellicum, any quantities ordered pursuant to an accepted Purchase Order but not actually delivered on the designated Delivery date. If a delay in any such Delivery of Miltenyi Products exceeds ten (10) Days, then Bellicum may require a pro rata reduction in its then-current Monthly Forecast to account for such delay.\n\n6.2 Title and Risk. Title and risk of loss or damage to Miltenyi Products shall pass to Bellicum as defined by Incoterm FCA (Incoterms 2010). Should any of the Delivered Miltenyi Products be damaged during transit to Bellicum or Bellicum's designee, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.4, a replacement order to replace such damaged Miltenyi Products shall be fulfilled, even if the volume limitations defined in Section 5.2 are exceeded, by Miltenyi in good faith and as soon as practicable (and such replacement order shall be considered a new Purchase Order during the applicable Firm Zone).\n\n6.3 Partial Delivery. With Bellicum's specific prior written consent, Miltenyi may make partial shipment against Purchase Orders, to be separately invoiced with each shipment and paid for when due in accordance with this Agreement. For such partial shipments, Miltenyi will pay all shipment costs associated with such subsequent or additional shipments.\n\n6.4 Minimum Guaranteed Shelf Life. Miltenyi shall ensure that, at the time of Delivery the remaining shelf life of each shipped Miltenyi Product shall be no less than the minimum shelf life set forth in Exhibit B as such Exhibit B Module may be amended from time to time by written notification of Miltenyi to Bellicum. As of the Effective Date the Minimum Guaranteed Shelf Life of certain Miltenyi Products is relatively short and thus requires Bellicum to perform a tight materials management (i.e. short-termed\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nordering of such Miltenyi Products) regarding production planning of Bellicum Product. The Parties mutually agree to use their [...***...] to implement any back-office activities as necessary to implement a) an increased Minimum Guaranteed Shelf Life and/or b) improvements to material management and production planning to address the challenge in the previous sentence and the Parties agree to provide to each other reasonable assistance where practicable to implement such back-office changes as necessary, taking into account cost, resource and capacity requirements.\n\n6.5 Certificates. Miltenyi shall include proper release certificates, certificates of compliance, and/or certificates of analysis with all shipments of Miltenyi Product, as applicable, in accordance with the requirements of the Quality Agreement.\n\n6.6 Product Shortage. Miltenyi shall promptly notify Bellicum of any potential or anticipated shortfall in the manufacturing or inventory of any Miltenyi Product that may adversely affect the Delivery of such Miltenyi Product in accordance with Bellicum's forecast requirements and pending Purchase Orders therefor. If Miltenyi is unable to supply any Miltenyi Product subject to a pending Purchase Order for any reason, then the Parties shall, in good faith, seek to agree on a revised date (or dates) for Delivery and Miltenyi shall undertake prompt and diligent efforts to mitigate the adverse impact on Bellicum. In the case of a limited availability of any Miltenyi Product, in selling such Miltenyi Product, Miltenyi shall take into account the aggregate volume of Miltenyi Products purchased by Bellicum, and shall subject to reasonable ethical standards provide to Bellicum priority access to Miltenyi Product consistent with such Miltenyi Product purchase volumes and critical medical needs. If due to the fault or error of Miltenyi or a Third-Party supplier or Subcontractor of Miltenyi or Force Majeure, Miltenyi fails to deliver any Miltenyi Product in the quantities specified in Bellicum's Purchase Order, Miltenyi shall use all [...***...] that may be necessary in order to minimize the shortfall, and deliver the ordered Miltenyi Product as soon as possible. If Miltenyi fails to propose a reasonably acceptable plan for the Delivery or if the delay is more than thirty (30) days following the confirmed Delivery Date, Bellicum may, at its reasonable election and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, cancel the Purchase Order(s) without penalty.\n\n6.7 Continuity of Supply.\n\n(a) Contingent upon Bellicum's continued adherence to its obligations in accordance with this Agreement, including the Forecast obligations and Firm Zone Requirements pursuant to Sections 5.1 and 5.3 above, Miltenyi shall use [...***...] have and devote adequate manufacturing capacity to ensure continuous supply of Miltenyi Products to Belicum in accordance with the Forecasts during the Term, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.7. However, Miltenyi's compliance with this Section 6.7(a) shall not require Miltenyi to incur any significant expenses to purchase new equipment, to install equipment purchased or requested by Bellicum, or to add (or, for clarity, allocate or dedicate) additional manufacturing or storage capacity for the manufacturing and supply of Miltenyi Products to Bellicum hereunder.\n\n(b) In the event that Miltenyi becomes aware that it will not be able, or is likely not to be able, to produce all of Bellicum's forecast requirements of Miltenyi Products from its primary facility located in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany, Miltenyi shall determine, at its option and expense, to establish additional or alternative manufacturing and supply capability for the Miltenyi Products by qualifying and maintaining one or more back-up manufacturing facilities at the premises of Miltenyi and/or any of its Affiliates (each, a \"Secondary Location\"). Use of a Secondary Location must be notified to Bellicum in writing in accordance with the Change Notification processes set forth in Section 3.2. Miltenyi shall use its best efforts to provide to Bellicum with a commercially reasonable number of samples of the \"Secondary Location Miltenyi Products\" (meaning such Miltenyi Products that are produced at such Secondary Location) for evaluation by Bellicum as soon as each such Secondary Location Miltenyi Product becomes available during the post-noficiation period. In the event that Miltenyi decides to qualify a Secondary Location for the supply of Miltenyi Products hereunder, it shall provide reasonable prior written notice thereof (not less than\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nsix (6) months in advance) to Bellicum, including such details as Bellicum reasonably requires to assess the qualifications of such Secondary Location. Miltenyi shall have sole responsibility for all activities in connection with the setup and approval of the Secondary Location, including for establishing proof of product equivalence for Miltenyi Products produced at the Secondary Location, process and equipment validation and for filing all submissions or other correspondence with Miltenyi's applicable Regulatory Authorities in connection with the Secondary Location.\n\n(c) In addition, Miltenyi may from time to time determine, in its sole discretion, to have one or more Miltenyi Products manufactured, assembled and/or supplied, in whole or in part, by a Subcontractor chosen by Miltenyi and reasonably acceptable to Bellicum. Miltenyi shall provide Bellicum with prior written notification of such Change in accordance with the applicable notification procedures as set forth in the Section Change Control and in the Quality Agreement, if applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Miltenyi shall remain responsible for the fulfilment of its supply and other obligations hereunder with respect to any Miltenyi Product manufactured by Miltenyi's Subcontractor. Miltenyi shall be solely responsible for providing proof of product equivalence and for filing all submissions or other correspondence with the applicable governmental or regulatory authorities in connection with any decision to seek approval of a Third Party subcontractor site for the Miltenyi Products. Further, Miltenyi shall be solely responsible for all process and equipment validation required by the responsible Regulatory Authorities and the regulations thereunder and shall take all steps reasonably necessary to pass government inspection by such Regulatory Authorities\n\n(d) In addition, the Parties shall from time to time discuss in good faith and mutually and reasonably agree upon (i) whether one or more Miltenyi Products require a minimum inventory to be held by Bellicum, and (ii) whether there shall be any type of Miltenyi Product that require a minimum inventory to be held by Miltenyi on behalf of Bellicum and under which terms and conditions such minimum inventory shall be reserved for Bellicum.\n\n6.8 Continuity of Supply - Commercial Phase.\n\nIf a given Module involves supply of Miltenyi Products for Bellicum's Commercial Phase activities, Section 6.8(b) shall apply, provided that additional terms and conditions regarding continuity of supply for such Commercial Phase activities pursuant to such Module have been negotiated in good faith and mutually agreed upon in such Module. The Parties acknowledge that provisions in such Module relating to additional terms and conditions regarding such continuity of supply will depend on the specific Miltenyi Product(s) that are relevant to such Module, and further acknowledge that such provision(s) in such Module may be subject to the Parties' good faith negotiation and mutual agreement regarding additional terms and conditions relevant to minimum purchase requirements (if any) for Miltenyi Product(s) under a Module.\n\n(a) Principal Terms.\n\n(1) In the event of a Supply Failure (as defined below), Bellicum shall have the option to request Miltenyi to establish, as soon as reasonably feasible and at Miltenyi's sole cost and expense, a Secondary Location reasonably capable of making up the Supply Failure of the affected Miltenyi Product (the \"Affected Miltenyi Product\"), and if Miltenyi should either (i) notify Bellicum in writing that it is not willing and/or capable to establish a Secondary Location, or (ii) should not have established such Secondary Location and made up the Supply Failure within a reasonable period of time with regard to the Affected Miltenyi Product from receipt of Bellicum's written request therefore, then Bellicum shall, at Bellicum's sole cost and expense, have the right to select, qualify, and maintain an additional second source manufacturing facility as a back-up manufacturing facility for the Affected Miltenyi Products at the premises of a Third Party (the \"Second-Source Supplier\"). In the event that Bellicum elects to qualify a Second-Source Supplier for an Affected Miltenyi Product, it shall provide Miltenyi with prior written notice to Miltenyi including such details as Miltenyi reasonably requires to assess the qualifications of such Second-Source Supplier. Any such Second-Source Supplier shall be subject to the prior written consent of Miltenyi, which\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nshall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except as necessary in Miltenyi's reasonable judgment to protect the bona fide and legitimate interests of Miltenyi in protecting its proprietary Intellectual Property Rights from misappropriation or misuse (e.g., by disclosure to a Miltenyi Competitor). If Miltenyi so withholds its consent, it shall propose alternative Second-Source Suppliers reasonably acceptable to both Miltenyi and Bellicum. If the Parties fail to identify a mutually acceptable Second-Source Supplier within thirty (30) days, Bellicum may proceed with an alternative Second-Source Supplier of its choice (however not a Miltenyi Competitor) without Miltenyi's consent.\n\n(2) For purposes hereof, each of the following events shall be deemed a \"Supply Failure\":\n\n(i) if Miltenyi, using [...***...], fails to deliver to Bellicum at least [...***...]% (on a Miltenyi Product-by-Miltenyi Product basis) of an accepted Purchase Order of Miltenyi Product placed by Bellicum in accordance with the relevant binding Forecast within a reasonable period of time after the agreed Delivery Date therefor (whether by reason of Force Majeure or otherwise) more than twice during any Calendar Year; provided, however, that any of the foregoing events shall not be considered a Supply Failure to the extent that it results from:\n\n(x) an act or omission of Bellicum, including any specific written instructions or requirements issued by Bellicum, including an Bellicum- Requested Change; or\n\n(y) the failure or delay on the part of any supplier of materials designated and required by Bellicum or any other Subcontractor designated and required by Bellicum; or\n\n(z) a Required Change or other change in any material requirement relating to the development, manufacturing, packaging and shipping of Miltenyi Product at Miltenyi's facility required by Applicable Laws, or the imposition of any other condition with respect to the Miltenyi Product by any governmental body or agency, or Regulatory Authority, based on Applicable Laws, or an event of Force Majeure, unless Miltenyi fails to use [...***...] to remedy the failure, inability, or delay within a reasonable period of time. In the event of the foregoing failures, inabilities, or delays, the Parties shall meet and discuss in good faith how to remedy the situation.\n\n(ii) If Miltenyi fails to Deliver to Bellicum at least [...***...]% (on a Miltenyi Product-by-Miltenyi Product basis) of an accepted Purchase Order, then for that Miltenyi Product affected by such failed Delivery, the next step in the Discount scheme set forth in Exhibit F shall be applied to such Miltenyi Product during the following two (2) Calendar Quarters (and a repeated failure shall result in further step in the Discount scheme being applied in like manner).\n\n(3) In the event that Bellicum selects a Second-Source Supplier over Miltenyi's reasonable objection, Miltenyi shall not be responsible to Bellicum for the performance of the said Second-Source Supplier. Any such Second-Source Supplier shall, as a condition of qualification, provide reasonable and customary undertakings to Miltenyi related to the protection of Miltenyi's Confidential Information. Bellicum shall be primarily responsible, with Miltenyi's reasonable cooperation and assistance, for providing proof of product equivalence and for filing all submissions or other correspondence with the applicable governmental or regulatory authorities in connection with any decision to seek approval of a manufacturing facility as Second-Source Supplier for Affected Miltenyi Product. Further, Bellicum shall be primarily responsible, with Miltenyi's reasonable assistance, for all process and equipment validation\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nrequired by the responsible Regulatory Authorities and the regulations thereunder and shall take all steps reasonably necessary to pass government inspection by such Regulatory Authorities.\n\n(4) In the event of a Supply Failure, Miltenyi shall grant Bellicum's Second-Source Supplier a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, one-site production license, without the right to sublicense, under Miltenyi's Intellectual Property Rights solely to the extent reasonably necessary to manufacture the Affected Miltenyi Product for the Permitted Use by Bellicum at Bellicum's cost. For the avoidance of doubt, a Second-Source Supplier's license under this subsection shall not permit the manufacture of any Miltenyi Product that is not subject to Supply Failure. A Second-Source Supplier's license hereunder shall subsist until such time as Miltenyi and Bellicum reach agreement on alternative license and/or supply arrangements which shall, inter alia, take into consideration: (i) Miltenyi's interest in regaining control over the manufacture of Miltenyi Products, (ii) Bellicum's interest in securing continuity of supply of the Affected Miltenyi Product(s), (iii) the costs incurred by Bellicum in establishing the Second-Source Supplier to rectify the applicable Supply Failure, (iv) the avoidance of potential adverse effects (supply disruption) that may result from the transfer of manufacturing back to Miltenyi, and (v) the appropriate sharing of costs resulting from the Supply Failure.\n\n(5) In furtherance of the Second-Source Supplier's license grant pursuant to subsection (4) above, Miltenyi shall, to the extent reasonably necessary:\n\n(i) provide the Second-Source Supplier, subject to a non-disclosure agreement on terms no less restrictive than those set forth herein, with prompt access to the documentation, protocols, assays, SOPs, materials, including biological materials, and other know-how and information constituting the manufacturing process of the Affected Miltenyi Product(s);\n\n(ii) assist the Second-Source Supplier with the working up and use of Miltenyi's technology, including providing a reasonable level of technical assistance and consultation;\n\n(iii) provide the Second-Source Supplier with additional disclosures of information and technical assistance and consultation as necessary to keep the Second-Source Supplier informed of the then-current Miltenyi Intellectual Property Rights and the then-current manufacturing process(es) for the Affected Miltenyi Product(s); and\n\n(iv) provide such other assistance to Bellicum and the Second-Source Supplier as may be reasonably required to give effect to such license.\n\n(6) Unless Miltenyi is in material breach, Bellicum will pay for work requested by Bellicum and conducted by or on behalf of Miltenyi, and reimburse Miltenyi for all reasonable and necessary costs and expenses incurred by Miltenyi, in establishing and maintaining Bellicum's Second-Source Supplier for an Affected Miltenyi Product.\n\nARTICLE 7 ACCEPTANCE AND REJECTION.\n\n7.1 Acceptance Testing. Bellicum or (for Miltenyi Product purchased by Bellicum but shipped directly to a Bellicum's Affiliate, Subcontractor, or Licensee) Bellicum's designated recipient of the\n\nshipment of Miltenyi Product will promptly upon Delivery visually inspect each shipment of Miltenyi Product delivered hereunder to (i) determine whether such Miltenyi Product is damaged and (ii) verify that the quantity of Miltenyi Product delivered conforms with the Purchase Order and other applicable documentation. Further, Bellicum shall have a period of [...***...] days from the date of Delivery to\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nperform, or have its Affiliate, Subcontractor, or Licensee (as the case may be) perform, incoming quality assurance testing on each shipment of Miltenyi Product in accordance with the Bellicum-approved quality control testing procedures as set forth in the Product Specifications or the Quality Agreement, as applicable (the \"Testing Methods\"), to verify conformance with the Product Specifications. For the avoidance of doubt, Bellicum shall have no obligation under this Section 7.1 to inspect or test the contents of the Miltenyi Products other than as in accordance with the agreed Testing Methods, save as prescribed by Applicable Laws.\n\n7.2 Rejection. Bellicum or its designee shall have the right to reject any shipment of Miltenyi Products that does not conform with the applicable Miltenyi Product Warranty at the time of Delivery when tested in accordance with the Testing Methods (each, a \"Rejected Product\"). Except in the case of latent defects as described in Section 7.3, each shipment of Miltenyi Products shall be deemed accepted by Bellicum if Bellicum or its designated recipient of the shipment does not provide Miltenyi with written notice of rejection (a \"Rejection Notice\") within [...***...] days from the date of receipt of the relevant shipment of Miltenyi Product, describing the reasons for the rejection and the non-conforming characteristics of such Rejected Product in reasonable detail. Once a Delivery of Miltenyi Products is accepted or deemed accepted hereunder, Bellicum shall have no recourse against Miltenyi in the event any such Miltenyi Product is subsequently deemed unsuitable for use for any reason, except for Miltenyi Product that does not conform to the Miltenyi Product Warranty after said 30-day period due to a latent defect in the Miltenyi Product that could not be detected through the performance of the Testing Methods.\n\n7.3 Latent Defects. Bellicum shall have the further right to reject such quantities of Miltenyi Product accepted or deemed accepted pursuant to Section 7.2 above by providing a Rejection Notice on the grounds that all or part of the shipment fails to comply with the Miltenyi Product Warranty to the extent such non-conformance could not have reasonably been determined by visual inspection or incoming quality assurance testing in accordance with Section 7.1, provided that the applicable shelf-life of the Miltenyi Product has not expired and such non-conformance is unrelated to the shipping or storage of the Miltenyi Product after Delivery. The rejection provisions of Section 7.2 above shall apply. Notification to Miltenyi by Bellicum must occur within [...***...] days after Bellicum or Bellicum's designated recipient of the shipment becomes aware or reasonably should have become aware that the Miltenyi Product fails to comply with the Miltenyi Product Warranty.\n\n7.4 Confirmation. After its receipt of a Rejection Notice from Bellicum or its designee pursuant to Section 7.2, Miltenyi shall notify Bellicum in writing as soon as reasonably practical whether or not it accepts Bellicum's basis for rejection, and Bellicum shall reasonably cooperate with Miltenyi in determining in good faith whether such rejection was necessary or justified. Upon Miltenyi's reasonable request, Bellicum shall provide, or cause its designees to provide, (i) evidence of appropriate transport, storage and handling for any Rejected Product in accordance with the storage and handling instructions set forth in the applicable Product Specifications; and (ii) reasonable testing data demonstrating that the Miltenyi Product in question does not conform to the Miltenyi Product Warranty. If the Parties are unable to agree as to whether a shipment of Miltenyi Products supplied by Miltenyi hereunder conforms to the applicable Miltenyi Product Warranty, such question shall be submitted to an independent quality control laboratory mutually agreed upon by the Parties. The findings of such independent quality control laboratory shall be binding upon the Parties. The cost of the independent quality control laboratory shall be borne by the Party whose results are shown by such laboratory to have been incorrect.\n\n7.5 Return or Destruction of Rejected Products. Bellicum may not return or destroy any batch of Miltenyi Products until it receives written notification from Miltenyi that Miltenyi does not dispute that such batch fails to conform to the applicable Miltenyi Product Warranty. Miltenyi will indicate in its notice either that Bellicum is authorized to destroy the rejected batch of Miltenyi Products, or that Miltenyi requires return of the rejected Miltenyi Products. Upon written authorization from Miltenyi to do so, Bellicum shall promptly destroy the rejected batch of Miltenyi Products and provide Miltenyi with written certification of\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nsuch destruction. Upon receipt of Miltenyi's request for return, Bellicum shall promptly return the rejected batch of Miltenyi Products to Miltenyi. In each case, Miltenyi will reimburse Bellicum for the documented, reasonable costs associated with the destruction or return of the rejected Miltenyi Products.\n\n7.6 Replacement or Refund. Bellicum shall not be required to pay any invoice with respect to any shipment of Miltenyi Products properly rejected pursuant to this Section 7.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Bellicum shall be obligated to pay in full for any rejected shipment of Miltenyi Products that is not returned or destroyed in accordance with Section 7.5 above, and that is subsequently determined to conform to the applicable Miltenyi Product Warranty, irrespective of whether Bellicum has already paid Miltenyi for a replacement shipment (but in such event, the replacement shipment will be Delivered to Bellicum and will be included in Bellicum's Minimum Purchases). If Bellicum pays in full for a shipment of Miltenyi Products and subsequently properly rejects such shipment in accordance with Section 7.2, Bellicum shall be entitled, upon confirmation that such shipment failed to conform to the applicable Miltenyi Product Warranty, either, at Bellicum's option: (i) to a refund or credit equal to the Product Price paid with respect to such rejected shipment (including without limitation, taxes paid and shipping expenses); or (ii) to require Miltenyi to promptly replace and Deliver to Bellicum an amount of Miltenyi Products that conforms to the requirements of this Agreement at no additional cost to Bellicum. Bellicum acknowledges and agrees that Bellicum's rights to a refund or credit for, or to receive replacement of, properly rejected shipments of Miltenyi Products hereunder shall be Bellicum's sole and exclusive remedy, and Miltenyi's sole obligation, with respect to non-conforming Miltenyi Products delivered hereunder.\n\n7.7 Exceptions. Bellicum's rights of rejection, return, refund and replacement set forth in this Article 7 shall not apply to any Miltenyi Product that is non-conforming due to damage (i) caused by Bellicum, its Affiliates, Subcontractors, or Licensees or their respective employees or agents, including but not limited to, misuse, neglect, improper storage, transportation or use beyond any dating provided, or (ii) that occurs after Delivery of such Miltenyi Product in accordance with this Agreement, including any damage caused thereafter by accident, fire or other hazard, and Miltenyi shall have no liability or responsibility to Bellicum with respect thereto.\n\nARTICLE 8 FINANCIAL TERMS\n\n8.1 Upfront Payment. Following execution of this Agreement and within [...***...] days of Bellicum's receipt of an invoice therefor, and as consideration for (i) the right to use certain Miltenyi Products for human use, including the right to cross-reference to the Master File(s) and Miltenyi's additional filings in connection with such Master File(s) as described in Article 4; (ii) Miltenyi's obligation to supply certain Miltenyi Products for human clinical trials and commercialized human use; and (iii) Miltenyi's support of Bellicum's development and commercialization efforts regarding Bellicum Products, Bellicum will pay to Miltenyi a non-refundable upfront fee in the aggregate amount of two million Euro (\u20ac2,000,000) (the \"Upfront Fee\"). The Upfront Fee will be paid in installments, as follows: (a) a first installment of [...***...] Euro (\u20ac[...***...]), to be invoiced by Miltenyi following execution of this Agreement; (b) a second installment of [...***...] Euro (\u20ac[...***...]), to be invoiced by Miltenyi following the first anniversary of the Effective Date.\n\n8.2 Milestone Payments. For each particular Bellicum Product, Bellicum will pay to Miltenyi [...***...], one-time only milestone payments of [...***...] Euro (\u20ac[...***...]) each, [...***...] milestone payment corresponding to [...***...], and [...***...] milestone payment corresponding to [...***...], or [...***...], whatever comes earlier, respectively, of such Bellicum Product, as set forth in such Bellicum Product's or Bellicum Program corresponding Module(s).\n\n8.3 Third Party Fees and Royalties. Bellicum will reimburse Miltenyi for Third Party royalties and/or license fees, if any, owed by Miltenyi under Third Party license agreements existing as of the Effective Date as set forth on Exhibit D solely to the extent Miltenyi's exercise of rights under such licenses is required\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nto supply Miltenyi Product to Bellicum under this Agreement for the Permitted Use; and further provided that amounts owed under such Third Party license agreements have not otherwise been passed through to Bellicum and are actually paid by Miltenyi to Miltenyi's licensor(s). Bellicum acknowledges that the potential volume of such Third Party royalties and/or license fees under applicable Third Party license agreements will be as set forth on Exhibit D, as updated from time to time by Miltenyi. If, during the Term of this Agreement, the Parties mutually agree to obtain additional Third Party licenses to enable the Permitted Use of Miltenyi Products by Bellicum, its Affiliates, Subcontractors, and/or Licensees under this Agreement, and such additional licenses give rise to Third Party royalties and/or license fees with respect to Bellicum's use of Miltenyi Products under this Agreement, then the Parties will negotiate in good faith which Party(ies) is/are responsible for payment of such Third Party royalties and/or license fees. Miltenyi, acting reasonably, reserves the right to defer the inclusion of additional Miltenyi Products in Exhibit B hereto until the Parties have reached agreement on this matter.\n\n8.4 Pricing\n\n(a) Product Price. In consideration of the supply and Delivery of Miltenyi Products under and in accordance with this Agreement, Miltenyi agrees to sell and Deliver and Bellicum agrees to purchase Miltenyi Products under and in accordance with this Agreement at the Purchase Price listed for each unit of a Miltenyi Product set forth on Exhibit E (the \"Product Price\").\n\n(b) Tiered Pricing. Bellicum shall be entitled to a reduction of the Product Prices set forth in Exhibit F (collectively, the \"Discounts\"). The Discount, as applicable to a particular Miltenyi Product in a Calendar Year, shall be based on Bellicum's and its Subcontractors' and Licensees' consolidated volume purchases of such Miltenyi Product in a Calendar Year. Within the first Calendar Year, Miltenyi shall analyze Bellicum's and its Subcontractors' and Licensees' purchases of Miltenyi Products at the end of each Calendar Quarter; if such purchases for a particular Miltenyi Product exceed the volume threshold of the then applicable Discount (based on binding and firm Purchase Orders received by Miltenyi in that Calendar Quarter), then, in the following Calendar Quarter, for all Purchase Orders regarding such Miltenyi Product, the corresponding higher Discount level in accordance with the volume thresholds as defined in Exhibit F shall apply. Subject to Bellicum reaching the Minimum Purchase requirements in accordcance with Section 5.6 in a Calendar Year, for the subsequent Calandar Year, the Discount applicable for the first Discount volume threshold shall apply, beginning from the first Miltenyi Product ordered by Bellicum under this Agreement during such subsequent Calendar Year.\n\n(c) Purchase Price Adjustments. Miltenyi shall be entitled to modify the Purchase Price for any Miltenyi Product as set forth in Section 8.3(a) above and Exhibit E on or after the commencement of each Calendar Year during the Term after Contract Year 1 in accordance with this Section 8.4(c), provided that there shall not be more than one (1) Purchase Price increase with respect to the same Miltenyi Product in any given Contract Year during the Term. In case, after application of the applicable Discount, any Purchase Price increases [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) annually, then the Parties shall consult each other, negotiate in good faith and agree in writing upon an adaptation of the applicable Discount to stay within the capping of a [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) increase, except for cases when such Purchase Price increase is the result of a documented increase of more than [...***...] ([...***...]%) in the cost of any raw materials, packaging and/or other components used in the manufacture of Miltenyi Product and Miltenyi, at Bellicum's request, has provided reasonable documentation evidencing such changes in production costs. It is however expressly agreed between the Parties that the adjusted Purchase Price charged to Bellicum for Miltenyi Product supplied hereunder shall in no event exceed Miltenyi's then-current list prices for such Miltenyi Product as in effect in the country of destination or use of the applicable Miltenyi Product, as published from time to time in Miltenyi's applicable product catalogue.\n\n(d) Product Price Adjustments resulting from Changes. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the limitations on Product Price increases set forth in Section 8.3(c) above shall not apply to\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nProduct Price adjustments resulting from a Required Change or a Bellicum-Requested Change pursuant to Section 3.2(d) hereof.\n\n8.5 Payment Terms. The payment terms for all payments made by Bellicum for purchased Miltenyi Products shall be as follows:\n\n(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all undisputed and properly due payments are payable within [...***...] days of Bellicum's receipt of each invoice corresponding to a shipment of Miltenyi Products by Miltenyi, such invoices to be issued by Miltenyi or the applicable Miltenyi Affiliate in the Forecast Territory.\n\n(b) Bellicum shall make all payments by wire transfer or electronic fund transfer in immediately available funds to an account designated by Miltenyi or its local Affiliate in the Forecast Territory, as applicable. All payments by Bellicum to Miltenyi or its Affiliate (as the case may be) under this Agreement shall be made in the local currency that applies to the Miltenyi company that is assigned to fulfill the respective Purchase Order for Miltenyi Products.\n\n(c) All sums payable by Bellicum under this Agreement are stated exclusive of sales tax and VAT.\n\n(d) Without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to Miltenyi, Miltenyi reserves the right to assess a late fee equal to [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) per month, or if lower, the maximum amount permitted by Applicable Law, on all undisputed and properly due amounts not paid by Bellicum when due. Bellicum acknowledges that failure by Bellicum to comply with its payment obligations in this Article 8 shall constitute a material breach.\n\n(e) Except as expressly provided herein, Bellicum shall not exercise any right of setoff, net-out or deduction, take any credit, or otherwise reduce the balance owed to Miltenyi with respect to any payments under this Agreement, unless the Parties otherwise agree or until Bellicum has obtained a final and non-appealable judgment against Miltenyi in the amount asserted by Bellicum.\n\n8.6 Taxes. All payments made under this Agreement shall be free and clear of any and all taxes, duties, levies, fees or other charges, except for withholding taxes. Each Party shall be entitled to deduct from its payment to the other Party under this Agreement the amount of any withholding taxes required to be withheld, to the extent paid to the appropriate governmental authority on behalf of the other Party (and not refunded or reimbursed). Each Party shall deliver to the other Party, upon request, proof of payment of all such withholding taxes. Each Party shall provide reasonable assistance to the other Party in seeking any benefits available to such Party with respect to government tax withholdings by any relevant law, regulation or double tax treaty.\n\n8.7 Right to Suspend. Without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to Miltenyi, Miltenyi shall have the right to suspend its performance under this Agreement if and to the extent Bellicum materially fails to perform its payment obligations under this Agreement and fails to cure such failure within five Business Days after confirmed receipt of a notice of breach from Miltenyi. For the avoidance of doubt, the failure by Bellicum to make timely payments of any material, undisputed amount that is properly due Miltenyi under this Agreement shall constitute a material failure of Bellicum to perform its payment obligations under this Agreement. Without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to Bellicum, Bellicum shall have the right to suspend payment under this Agreement if and to the extent Miltenyi materially fails to perform its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nARTICLE 9 INSPECTION\n\n9.1 Facility Audits. Upon commercially reasonable notice (to be provided not less than [...***...] days in advance) and during Miltenyi's normal business hours, but not more often than once every [...***...] months, except for cause, during the Term of this Agreement, Bellicum or Bellicum's Licensees duly authorized agents, representatives or designees may inspect those portions of Miltenyi's Facilities that are used to manufacture, store or conduct testing of Miltenyi Products to determine compliance with Agreed Standards, Applicable Laws and the applicable Quality Agreement. Such representatives shall comply with the applicable rules and regulations for workers at such Facilities and shall enter into reasonable confidentiality and non-use agreements if so requested by Miltenyi, as a representative of Bellicum or such Licensee (and not in an individual capacity). All audits shall be conducted in a manner that is intended to minimize disruption to the operations at such Facilities. Miltenyi shall promptly address and correct any deviations from Agreed Standards, Applicable Laws and/or the provisions of the applicable Quality Agreement identified in connection with such inspections.\n\n9.2 Exempt Documentation. Miltenyi reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to exempt certain documentation from such audit described in Section 9.1 if and to the extent this is reasonably required in order to protect Miltenyi's trade secrets in Miltenyi Technology and/or other Miltenyi Intellectual Property Rights or Third Party Intellectual Property rights. If such exemption will have a material impact on the scope of a representative's inspection, the Parties will discuss in good faith other means to provide sufficient information to such representative.\n\n9.3 Inspection by Regulatory Authority. Miltenyi shall permit inspections of the Miltenyi Facility by Regulatory Authorities and shall respond to any notices or requests for information by Regulatory Authorities for any import or export license, registration or pending registration for manufacturing of Miltenyi Products during the Term of the Agreement. Miltenyi shall permit representatives of any applicable Regulatory Authority to access, at any reasonable time during normal business hours, any and all relevant records and information, personnel and facilities. To the extent that a Regulatory Authority raises any quality issue during or following a Regulatory Authority inspection that would Bellicumbe reasonably likely to adversely affect the suitability of the Miltenyi Products for any Permitted Use, Miltenyi shall promptly advise Bellicum in writing of such issue. The Parties will promptly give written notice to each other in advance of any scheduled inspection of Miltenyi's Facility by a Regulatory Authority.\n\n9.4 Cost of Audits and Inspections. If Bellicum or or Bellicum's Licensees conduct a Facility audit or inspection more than [...***...] in a [...***...] month period, and such additional audits are not \"for cause\" audits, then Bellicum and its Licensees (as applicable) shall reimburse Miltenyi for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by Miltenyi as a direct result of Facility audits and/or inspections pursuant to Sections 9.1and 9.3 solely to the extent that they relate to the review of a Bellicum Product. For clarity, Bellicum shall not be liable, in any event, for any costs and expenses incurred by Miltenyi to correct deficiencies of Miltenyi manufacturing procedures in order to comply with: 1) Agreed Standards, Applicable Laws, the applicable Quality Agreement and Product Specifications; 2) inspection of a Miltenyi Product in general; and 3) inspection of a Third Party product.\n\nARTICLE 10 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\n10.1 Existing Intellectual Property. Except as the Parties may otherwise expressly agree in writing, each Party shall continue to own all rights, including all Intellectual Property Rights, in and title to its Technology existing as of the Effective Date or developed during the Term but outside the scope of this Agreement, without conferring any interests therein on the other Party. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, as between the Parties, the Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) Miltenyi owns and shall continue to own all rights (including all Intellectual Property Rights) in the Miltenyi Technology included in the Miltenyi Products supplied to Bellicum, and Bellicum shall not acquire any right, interest in or title to the Miltenyi Technology by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise, and (ii) Bellicum owns or\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\ncontrols and shall continue to own and control all rights (including all Intellectual Property Rights) in the Bellicum Technology and Bellicum Products (and any Intellectual Property rights thereof), and Miltenyi shall not acquire any right, interest in or title to the Bellicum Technology and Bellicum Products (and any Intellectual Property rights thereof) by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise.\n\n10.2 Limited License. Miltenyi hereby grants to Bellicum, subject to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, a limited non-exclusive right and license under the Miltenyi Technology incorporated or embodied in the Miltenyi Products supplied hereunder), solely to use such Miltenyi Products for the Permitted Use.

For the avoidance of doubt, the license granted to Bellicum under this Section 10.2 conveys no right to Bellicum, its Subcontractors or Licensees to use Miltenyi Technology to make, have made, import, have imported, offer for sale and/or sell any Miltenyi Product.\n\n10.3 Notification. Miltenyi will promptly notify Bellicum in writing of Miltenyi's receipt of any written claim or demand from any Third Party alleging that the practice of Miltenyi Technology infringes such Third Party's Intellectual Property Rights, or Miltenyi's receipt of written notice of the initiation of any legal action or other legal proceeding by any Third Party alleging that the practice of Miltenyi Technology infringes such Third Party's Intellectual Property Rights.\n\n10.4 Disclaimer. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed or interpreted, either expressly or by implication, estoppel or otherwise, as: (i) a grant, transfer or other conveyance by either Party to the other of any right, title, license or other interest of any kind in any portion of its Technology or Intellectual Property Rights, or (ii) creating an obligation on the part of either Party to make any such grant, transfer or other conveyance.\n\nARTICLE 11 WARRANTIES\n\n11.1 Miltenyi Product Warranty.

Bellicum represents, warrants and covenants to Miltenyi that:\n\n(1) Bellicum has the scientific, technical and other requisite competencies to determine the suitability of each Miltenyi Product purchased hereunder for the use to which Bellicum will put such Miltenyi Product;\n\n(2) As of the Effective Date, the Product Specifications are adequate to confirm the suitability of the Miltenyi Product (including its packaging and labelling) for the uses to which such Miltenyi Product will be put by Bellicum;\n\n(3) Bellicum will perform, and will cause its Subcontractors and Licensees to perform, sufficient incoming inspection of each supplied Miltenyi Product to comply with its obligations under this Agreement and under all Applicable Laws; and\n\n(4) Bellicum shall manufacture (and require and ensure that any Subcontractor or Licensee will manufacture) Bellicum Products using appropriate standards of care and quality in accordance with Applicable Laws and all requirements of Regulatory Authorities applicable to such manufacture; and\n\n(5) Bellicum shall use, and will cause its Subcontractors and Licensees to use, Miltenyi Products in accordance with all Applicable Laws and all requirements of Regulatory Authorities applicable to such use.\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\n11.4 Disclaimer.\n\n(a) EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR EXTENDS ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE, NON- INFRINGEMENT, VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF PATENTS, OR THE PROSPECTS OR LIKELIHOOD OF DEVELOPMENT OR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF PRODUCT.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding the generality of clause (a) above, Miltenyi hereby expressly disclaims any warranty that (i) the Miltenyi Products will be suitable for the development or manufacturing of a Bellicum Product, or (ii) Bellicum's intended use of the Miltenyi Products for the development or manufacturing of Bellicum Product will be approved by any Regulatory Authority, or (iii) the Miltenyi Products will otherwise be suitable in any respect for a Permitted Use or be commercially exploitable or profitable.\n\n(c) In no event shall Miltenyi or its Affiliates be responsible or liable for any non-conformance or other defects in the Miltenyi Product(s), including any non-conformance with the warranties in Section 11.1 and 11.2, to the extent resulting from improper use, handling, storage, transportation, or disposal of the Miltenyi Product(s) after Delivery thereof (including without limitation failure to use the Miltenyi Product(s) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the Product Specifications), accident, or from any other cause not attributable to defective workmanship or failure to meet the Miltenyi Product Warranty on the part of Miltenyi or its Affiliates.\n\n(d) Miltenyi's warranty under Section 11.2 does not relate to the potential uses of Miltenyi Products by Bellicum, its Subcontractors or Licensees in relation to Third Party rights, even if foreseeable. Bellicum acknowledges that there may be proprietary rights owned by Third Parties that may be necessary or desirable for the use of Miltenyi Products in connection with processes for the production and/or use of Bellicum Products, and Bellicum agrees that (i) securing access to such Third Party rights regarding such use of Miltenyi Products in the manufacture or use of a Bellicum Product is Bellicum's responsibility, and (ii) neither Miltenyi nor any of its Affiliates has any responsibility or liability with respect to any such Third Party proprietary rights regarding such use of Miltenyi Products in the manufacture or use of a Bellicum Product.\n\n11.5 Remedies.\n\n(a) Miltenyi's sole obligation, and Bellicum's sole and exclusive remedy for breach of the Miltenyi Product Warranty in Section 11.1, shall be as set forth in Article 7, including replacement or refund in accordance with Section 7.6, provided that Miltenyi shall pay reasonable return freight and shipping charges.\n\n(b) In the event of breach of Miltenyi's warranties in Section 11.2 due to an actual or alleged infringement of a Third Party's Intellectual Property Rights due to Miltenyi's manufacture or sale, or Bellicum's import, export or use of any Miltenyi Product, Miltenyi shall at its option use [...***...] to either promptly and diligently negotiate a license from such Third Party at its own expense (including the payment due to the Third Party for such license) or modify the relevant Miltenyi Product(s) so that the supplied Miltenyi Product(s) are no longer infringing but have equivalent functionality. If Miltenyi fails to negotiate such license or modify the applicable Miltenyi Product, and to the extent Bellicum reasonably determines, following consultation with Miltenyi, that it is obligated to take a royalty-bearing license under any Third Party Intellectual Property Rights in order to avoid infringement of such Third Party Intellectual Property Rights with respect to the use of the applicable Miltenyi Product, then Bellicum shall have the right to offset any payment actually made to the Third Party for such license in any Contract Year against any Product Price payable to Miltenyi for the applicable Miltenyi Product in the same\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nContract Year (on a Miltenyi Product-by-Miltenyi Product basis), under the proviso that Bellicum provides Miltenyi with reasonably satisfactory evidence of such Third Party royalties payment. The total amount of any reduction(s) pursuant to this Section 11.5(b) shall in no event exceed [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) of the Product Price payable for the applicable Miltenyi Product in that Contract Year (with the right to carry forward any unused offset).\n\n(c) The foregoing shall be Bellicum's sole and exclusive remedy and Miltenyi's sole obligation with respect to claims that any Miltenyi Product fails to comply with the Miltenyi Product Warranty or the warranties in Section 11.2. Miltenyi will not in any event be liable for increased manufacturing costs, downtime costs, purchase of substitute products, lost profits, revenue, or goodwill, or any other indirect incidental, special, or consequential damages caused by a breach of the Miltenyi Product Warranty or the warranties in Section 11.2.\n\nARTICLE 12 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n\n12.1 Limitation of Liability. Except for liability for (i) breach of the confidentiality obligations described in Article 14, (ii) misappropriation or infringement by a Party of the other Party's Intellectual Property Rights, or (iii) gross negligence or willful misconduct:\n\n(a) IN NO EVENT SHALL A PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR EXPENSES, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR USE, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING ERRORS OR OMISSIONS OR BREACH OF WARRANTY), EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES;\n\n(b) EACH PARTY'S MAXIMUM LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO DIRECT AND ACTUAL DAMAGES. IN NO ONE EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES OR LOSSES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE PRODUCT PRICES PAID BY BELLICUM FOR THE MILTENYI PRODUCT(S) DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY; AND FURTHER PROVIDED THAT SUCH AGGREGATE LIABILITY DURING SUCH PERIOD ALSO SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF SUCH PARTY'S INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SUCH AGGREGATE LIABILITY.\n\n12.2 No Liability for Clinical Trials. Bellicum shall have sole responsibility that any Bellicum Product is safe for human use, and Bellicum hereby assumes sole risk and liability arising out of or in connection with the use of Bellicum Products in clinical trials by or on behalf of Bellicum or commercialization of Bellicum Products (including product liability with respect thereto).\n\nARTICLE 13 INDEMNIFICATION; INSURANCE\n\n13.1 Indemnification by Miltenyi.

In the event Bellicum seeks indemnification under this Section\n\n34\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\n13.1, Bellicum shall (a) notify Miltenyi in writing of such Third Party claim as soon as reasonably practicable after it receives notice of the claim, (b) provided that Miltenyi is not contesting the indemnity obligation, permit Miltenyi to assume direction and control of the defense of the claim (including the right to settle the claim solely for monetary consideration), provided further that Miltenyi shall act reasonably and in good faith with respect to all matters relating to the settlement or disposition of any claim as the settlement or disposition relates to parties being indemnified under this Section 13.1, and (c) cooperate as requested (at Miltenyi's expense) in the defense of the claim; but provided always that Miltenyi may not settle any such claim or otherwise consent to an adverse judgment or order in any relevant action or other proceeding or make any admission as to liability or fault without the prior express written permission of an authorized representative of Bellicum.\n\n13.2 Indemnification by Bellicum. Bellicum will save, defend and hold harmless Miltenyi, its Affiliates, Subcontractors, officers, directors, employees, consultants and agents (collectively, \"Miltenyi Indemnitees\") from and against any and all Losses to which any such Miltenyi Indemnitee may become subject as a result of any claim, demand, action or other proceeding by any Third Party to the extent such Losses arise out of: (i) the material breach by Bellicum of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by it under this Agreement; (ii) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Bellicum Indemnitee (as defined above); or (iii) the development, manufacture, use, handling, storage, sale or other disposition of any Bellicum Product by or on behalf of Bellicum; except, in each case, to the extent such Losses result from the material breach by Miltenyi of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by it under this Agreement or the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Miltenyi Indemnitee. In the event Miltenyi seeks indemnification under this Section 13.2, Miltenyi shall (a) notify Bellicum in writing of such Third Party claim as soon as reasonably practicable after it receives notice of the claim, (b) provided that Bellicum is not contesting the indemnity obligation, permit Bellicum to assume direction and control of the defense of the claim (including the right to settle the claim solely for monetary consideration), provided further that Bellicum shall act reasonably and in good faith with respect to all matters relating to the settlement or disposition of any claim as the settlement or disposition relates to parties being indemnified under this Section 13.2, and (c) cooperate as requested (at Bellicum's expense) in the defense of the claim; but provided always that Bellicum may not settle any such claim or otherwise consent to an adverse judgment or order in any relevant action or other proceeding or make any admission as to liability or fault without the prior express written permission of Miltenyi.\n\n13.3 Survival of Indemnification Obligations. The provisions of this Article 13 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever.\n\n13.4 Insurance. Each Party will maintain at its sole cost and expense, an adequate amount of commercial general liability and product liability insurance throughout the Term and for a period of five (5) years thereafter, to protect against potential liabilities and risk arising out of products supplied or activities to be performed under this Agreement and any Quality Agreement related hereto upon such terms (including coverages, deductible limits and self-insured retentions) as are customary in the industry for the products supplied or activities to be conducted by such Party under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, such Bellicum liability insurance or self-insurance program will insure against personal injury, physical injury or property damage arising out of the pre-clinical, clinical and commercial manufacture, sale, use, distribution or marketing of Bellicum Product, and such Miltenyi liability insurance or self-insurance program will insure against personal injury, physical injury or property damage arising out of use of a Miltenyi Product in the manufacture of a Bellicum Product. In addition, from time to time during the Term, each Party shall increase their levels of insurance coverage if reasonably deemed prudent by such Party in light of the overall products supplied and/or activities performed under this Agreement. Each Party shall provide the other Party with written proof of the existence of such insurance upon reasonable written request.\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nARTICLE 14 CONFIDENTIALITY\n\n14.1 Definition. As used in this Agreement, the term \"Confidential Information\" means any information disclosed by one Party (the \"Disclosing Party\") to the other Party (the \"Receiving Party\") pursuant to this Agreement which is (a) in written, graphic, machine readable or other tangible form and is marked \"Confidential\", \"Proprietary\" or in some other manner to indicate its confidential nature, or (b) oral information disclosed pursuant to this Agreement, provided that such information is designated as confidential at the time of disclosure and reduced to a written summary by the Disclosing Party, within thirty (30) calendar days after its oral disclosure, which is marked in a manner to indicate its confidential nature and delivered to the Receiving Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Disclosing Party's failure to so mark any of its Confidential Information, whether disclosed in written, graphic, machine readable or other tangible form, or its failure to designate as confidential and reduce to writing any Confidential Information disclosed orally, shall not relieve the Receiving Party of its obligations hereunder with respect to such Confidential Information if its confidential nature would be apparent to a reasonable person in the biotechnology or biopharmaceutical industry, based on the subject matter of such Confidential Information or the circumstances under which it is disclosed.\n\n14.2 Non-Disclosure and Non-Use. During the Term and for five (5) years thereafter, each of Miltenyi and Bellicum shall keep Confidential Information of the other Party in strict confidence and shall not (i) use the other Party's Confidential Information for any use or purpose except as expressly permitted under this Agreement, the Quality Agreement or as otherwise authorized in writing in advance by the other Party, or (ii) disclose the other Party's Confidential Information to anyone other than those of its Affiliates, Subcontractors, directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, collaborators and consultants, and in the case of Bellicum, its Licensees (collectively, \"Authorized Representatives\") who need to know such Confidential Information for a use or purpose expressly permitted under this Agreement. Each Receiving Party shall take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party. Without limiting the foregoing, each Receiving Party shall take at least those measures that it takes to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature (but not less than reasonable measures) and shall ensure that any Authorized Representative of the Receiving Party who is permitted access to Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party pursuant to clause (ii) in the first sentence of this Section 14.2 is contractually or legally bound by obligations of non-disclosure and non-use in scope and content at least as protective of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information as the provisions hereof prior to any disclosure of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information to such Authorized Representative. The Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Authorized Representatives.\n\n14.3 Exceptions. Notwithstanding the above, a Receiving Party shall have no obligations under this Article 14 with regard to any information of the Disclosing Party which the Receiving Party can demonstrate through competent proof: (a) was generally known and available in the public domain at the time it was disclosed to the Receiving Party or becomes generally known and available in the public domain through no act or omission of the Receiving Party or its Authorized Representatives; (b) can be documented as previously known by the Receiving Party prior to disclosure thereof by the Disclosing Party; (c) is disclosed with the prior written approval of the Disclosing Party; (d) was independently developed by the Receiving Party without any use of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information; or (e) becomes known to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Disclosing Party without breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party; provided (i) only the specific information that meets the exclusions shall be excluded, and not any other information that happens to appear in proximity to such excluded portions (for example, a portion of a document may be excluded without affecting the confidential nature of those portions that do not themselves qualify for exclusion) or that happens to be disclosed at the same time or in connection therewith; and (ii) specific Confidential Information shall not be deemed to be known, disclosed, in the public domain nor in Receiving Party's possession merely because of broader or related information being known, disclosed, in the public domain or in Receiving Party's possession, nor\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nshall combinations of elements or principles be considered to be known, disclosed, in the public domain nor in Receiving Party's possession merely because individual elements thereof are known, disclosed, in the public domain or in Receiving Party's possession.\n\n14.4 Permitted Disclosure.\n\n(a) Compelled Disclosure. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 14, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Receiving Party from disclosing Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent the Receiving Party is legally required or compelled to do so by any governmental investigative or judicial agency or body pursuant to proceedings over which such agency or body has jurisdiction; provided, however, that prior to making any such required or compelled disclosure, the Receiving Party shall: (i) assert the confidential nature of the Confidential Information to such agency or body; (ii) promptly notify the Disclosing Party in writing of such order or requirement to disclose; and (iii) cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party in protecting against or limiting any such disclosure and/or obtaining a protective order, confidential treatment and/or any other remedy narrowing the scope of the required or compelled disclosure and protecting its confidentiality. In the event that a protective order, confidential treatment and/or other remedy is not obtained, or if the Disclosing Party waives compliance with the provisions of this Agreement as applied to such required or compelled disclosure, then the Receiving Party may, without liability, disclose the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information to the extent that it is legally required or compelled to disclose. The Receiving Party will furnish only that portion of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information that is legally required to disclose and will make all reasonable and diligent efforts to obtain reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be afforded to Confidential Information so disclosed. Disclosure of Confidential Information pursuant to this Section 14.4(a) shall not alter the character of that information as Confidential Information hereunder.\n\n(b) Authorized Disclosure. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 14, each Party may disclose the terms of this Agreement (i) in connection with the requirements of an initial public offering or securities filing; (ii) in confidence, to accountants, attorneys, other professional advisors, banks, and financing sources and their advisors; (iii) in confidence, in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement or rights under this Agreement; or (iv) in confidence, in connection with a merger or acquisition or proposed merger or acquisition, or a sale or proposed sale of its assets or business, or the like.\n\n14.5 Publicity. Each Party may disclose the existence of this Agreement, but agrees that the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be treated as Confidential Information of the other Party. Except as otherwise required by Applicable Laws or regulations, neither Party shall make any public announcement or press release regarding this Agreement or any terms thereof, or otherwise use the name, logos, trademarks or products of the other Party in any publication, without the other Party's express prior written consent.\n\n14.6 Remedies. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions of this Article 14 are necessary for the protection of the business and goodwill of the Parties and are considered by the Parties to be reasonable for such purpose. Each Party agrees that any violation of this Article 14 by it or its Affiliate, or Subcontractors may cause substantial and irreparable harm to the other Party and, therefore, in the event of any violation or threatened violation of this Article 14 by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek specific performance and other injunctive and equitable relief in addition to any other legal remedies available.\n\nARTICLE 15 TERM AND TERMINATION\n\n15.1 Term. This Agreement shall enter into force on the Effective Date. The Agreement shall have an initial term of ten (10) years commencing from the Effective Date and ending on the tenth (10th) anniversary thereof (the \"Initial Term\"), unless earlier terminated by either Party in accordance with the provisions of Section 15.2 or Section 15.3. Thereafter, Bellicum shall have consecutive separate options to extend the Term for successive renewal terms of five (5) years each (each, a \"Renewal Term\", and\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\ncollectively with the Initial Term, the \"Term\").

Notwithstanding Section 15.1 either Party may, in addition to any other remedies available to it under this Agreement or by law, terminate this Agreement or any particular Module as follows:\n\n(a) Termination for Material Breach. A Party may terminate this Agreement or a particular Module by providing written notice to the other Party describing the other Party's material breach and demanding its cure, in the event that the other Party materially breaches a material provision of this Agreement or such Module and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice of the breach or, if the breach is not susceptible to cure within such thirty (30) day period, if the breaching Party fails to submit to the notifying Party and implement within such thirty (30) day period a written remedial action plan reasonably satisfactory to the notifying Party that sets out appropriate corrective action for remedying such breach promptly after such 30-day period expires.\n\n(b) Termination for Bankruptcy or Insolvency. A Party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days' written notice to the other Party in the event the other Party shall have become insolvent or bankrupt, or shall have made an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or there shall have been appointed a trustee or receiver of the other Party, or if any case or proceeding shall have been commenced or other action taken by or against the other Party in bankruptcy or seeking reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, winding- up, arrangement, composition or readjustment of its debts or any relief under any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar act or law of any jurisdiction now or hereinafter in effect that is not dismissed within thirty (30) days after commencement.\n\n(c) Termination for Force Majeure.

Bellicum may terminate this Agreement or a particular Module upon ninety (90) days written notice to Miltenyi: 1) if Bellicum, in its sole and absolute discretion, discontinues or indefinitely suspends the development and/or commercialization of the Bellicum Product(s) or 2) without cause for any reason or no reason.

For clarity, termination of this Agreement or any Module pursuant to this Section 15.3 shall not release Bellicum from its payment obligations with respect to the quantities set forth in any Purchase Orders or quantities forecasted for any Firm Zone.\n\n15.4 Expiration or termination of this Agreement or a particular Module for any reason shall not release either Party from liability accrued under this Agreement or such Module, respectively, prior to such expiration or termination, nor preclude either Party from pursuing any rights or remedies accrued prior to such expiration or termination or accrued at law or in equity with respect to any uncured material breach of this Agreement or such Module.\n\n15.5 The termination of this Agreement or a particular Module shall not operate to relieve Bellicum from its obligation to pay undisputed and properly due amounts of (a) the Product Price of all\n\n38\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nquantities of Miltenyi Products (i) delivered in accordance with this Agreement, such Module(s) and the applicable Quality Agreement up to the effective date of termination and (ii) to be delivered under outstanding Purchase Orders accepted by Miltenyi prior to the date of notice of termination (including the Ordered Quantities) or (iii) forecasted for any Firm Zone in the most recent applicable Monthly Forecast; (b) any Upfront Fee payable under Section 8.1 and any earned Milestone Fee payable under Section 8.2 hereof; and (c) all other undisputed and properly due fees and/or expenses owed to Miltenyi in accordance with this Agreement, such Module(s) and the applicable Quality Agreement prior to the date of notice of termination; provided, however, that in the event of termination of this Agreement or such Module(s) by Bellicum pursuant to Section 15.2 (Termination for Cause), Bellicum shall not be responsible for payments relating to any portion of the Forecast applicable to any period after the effective date of termination.

In addition, either Party shall have the right to assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement to an Affiliate upon written notice to the non-assigning Party; provided, however, the assigning or transferring Party shall continue to remain liable\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nfor the performance of this Agreement by such Affiliate. Upon any such assignment, all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement binding upon, or inuring to the benefit of, the assigning Party shall be binding on, and inure to the benefit of, its assignee, whether so expressed in the assignment or not. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit Miltenyi or any of its Affiliates from granting a security interest in this Agreement and any rights hereunder to any Third Party in connection with any financing transaction to the extent provided under (and subject to the restrictions on the rights of secured parties contained in) Applicable Laws. In addition, Miltenyi or any Affiliate of Miltenyi shall have the right to sell, assign, pledge or otherwise transfer any accounts and payment intangibles in connection with any financing transaction. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of each Party, its successors and permitted assigns. Any assignment of this Agreement in contravention of this Article 17 shall be null and void.\n\nARTICLE 18 FORCE MAJEURE\n\n18.1 Neither Party will be liable to the other Party on account of any loss or damage resulting from any delay or failure to perform all or any part of this Agreement if such delay or failure is caused, in whole or in part, by events, occurrences, or causes beyond the reasonable control and without negligence of the Parties (\"Force Majeure Event\"). Such events, occurrences, or causes will include acts of God, strikes, lockouts, acts of war, riots, civil commotion, terrorist acts, epidemic, failure or default of public utilities or common carriers, destruction of facilities or materials by fire, explosion, earthquake, storm or the like catastrophe, and failure of plant or machinery (provided that such failure could not have been prevented by the exercise of skill, diligence and prudence that would be reasonably and ordinarily expected from a skilled and experienced person engaged in the same type of undertaking under the same or similar circumstances), but the inability to meet financial obligations is expressly excluded.\n\n18.2 The Party affected by a Force Majeure Event shall inform promptly the other Party in writing of the Force Majeure Event's occurrence, anticipated duration and cessation. The Party giving such notice shall thereupon be excused from such of its obligations hereunder as it is thereby disabled from performing for so long as it is so disabled, provided, however, that such affected Party commences and continues to take reasonable and diligent actions to cure such cause.\n\nARTICLE 19 APPLICABLE LAWS; JURISDICTION\n\n19.1 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, USA, without regard to the conflict of law provisions thereof or the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods; provided, however, that any dispute relating to the scope, validity, enforceability or infringement of any Intellectual Property Right will be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the substantive laws of the jurisdiction in which such Intellectual Property Right applies.\n\n19.2 Dispute Resolution Procedures. Should any dispute, claim or controversy arise between the Parties relating to the validity, interpretation, existence, performance, termination or breach of this Agreement (collectively, a \"Dispute\"), the Parties shall use their best efforts to resolve the Dispute by good faith negotiations, first between their respective representatives directly involved in that Dispute and the Alliance Managers for a period of thirty (30) days, and then, if necessary, between vice presidents of the Parties for an additional fifteen (15) days, and then, if necessary, between Chief Executive Officers of the Parties for an additional five (5) Business Days. Any such Dispute not satisfactorily settled by negotiation in accordance with the foregoing process, either Party may submit such Dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with subsection (a) below; provided that nothing in this Section 19.2 will preclude either Party from seeking injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with Section (a) below.\n\n(a) Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Venue. Each Party hereto agrees that any action, proceeding or claim it commences against the other Party pursuant to this Agreement shall be brought\n\n41\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nin the courts of the United States for the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment. Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction of the State of New York Courts and irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court, any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum and the right to object, with respect to any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court, that such court does not have jurisdiction over such Party. Each Party agrees that a final non-appealable judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding in such a court shall be conclusive and binding and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Applicable Law.\n\n(b) Waiver of Jury Trial. Due to the high costs and time involved in commercial litigation before a jury, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ANY AND ALL ISSUES IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n19.3 Injunctive Relief. Each Party acknowledges that its breach of its obligations under this Agreement may result in immediate and irreparable harm to the other Party, for which there may be no adequate remedy at law. Therefore, in the event of a breach or threatened breach, the non-breaching Party may, in addition to other remedies, immediately seek from any court of competent jurisdiction injunctive relief (including a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or other interim equitable relief) prohibiting the breach or threatened breach or compelling specific performance, without the necessity of proving actual damages. Such right to injunctive relief as provided for in this paragraph is in addition to, and is not in limitation of, whatever remedies either Party may be entitled to as a matter of law or equity, including money damages. The Parties agree to waive the requirement of posting a bond in connection with a court's issuance of an injunction.\n\nARTICLE 20 MISCELLANEOUS\n\n20.1 Governing Further Actions. Each Party will execute, acknowledge and deliver such further instruments, and do all such other acts, as may be necessary or appropriate in order to carry out the purposes and intent of the Agreement.\n\n20.2 Independent Contractors. The relationship between Miltenyi and Bellicum created by this Agreement is one of independent contractors. Neither Party shall have the power or authority to bind or obligate the other Party, or purport to take on any obligation or responsibility, or make any representations, warranties, guarantees or endorsements to anyone, on behalf of the other Party, except as expressly permitted in this Agreement.\n\n20.3 Entire Agreement and Amendment. This Agreement (including all Exhibits attached hereto, which are incorporated herein by reference, and as amended from time to time in accordance with the provisions hereof) and any Quality Agreement(s) sets forth all of the covenants, promises, agreements, warranties, representations, conditions and understandings between the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, and constitutes and contains the complete, final, and exclusive understanding and agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and cancels, supersedes and terminates all prior agreements and understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. There are no covenants, promises, agreements, warranties, representations conditions or understandings, whether oral or written, between the Parties other than as set forth herein or in a Quality Agreement. No subsequent alteration, amendment, change or addition to this Agreement (including all Exhibits attached hereto) shall be binding upon the Parties hereto unless reduced to writing and signed by the respective authorized officers of the Parties.\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\n20.4 Severability and Headings. If any term, condition or provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the Parties will negotiate in good faith a substitute, valid and enforceable provision that most nearly effects the Parties' intent and the Parties agree to be bound by the mutually agreed substitute provision. If the Parties fail to agree on such an amendment, such invalid term, condition or provision will be severed from the remaining terms, conditions and provisions, which will continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. Headings used in this Agreement are provided for convenience only, and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.\n\n20.5 No Waiver. Any waiver of the provisions of this Agreement or of a Party's rights or remedies under this Agreement must be in writing to be effective. Failure, neglect or delay by a Party to enforce the provisions of this Agreement or its rights or remedies at any time, will not be construed as a waiver of such Party's rights under this Agreement and will not in any way affect the validity of the whole or any part of this Agreement or prejudice such Party's right to take subsequent action. No exercise or enforcement by either Party of any right or remedy under this Agreement will preclude the enforcement by such Party of any other right or remedy under this Agreement or that such Party is entitled by law to enforce.\n\n20.6 Negotiated Terms. The Parties agree that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are the result of negotiations between the Parties and that this Agreement shall not be construed in favor of or against any Party by reason of the extent to which any Party or its professional advisors participated in the preparation of this Agreement.\n\n20.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which need not contain the signature of more than one Party but all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement, and may be executed through exchange of original signatures or electronic copies (PDF).\n\n[Remainder of this page intentionally left blank.

This Agreement will automatically renew for successive one year terms (each a \"Renewal Term\", and together with the Initial Term, the \"Term\"), unless either Charterer or Owner elects not to renew this Agreement by providing the other party with written notice of such election 30 days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or Renewal Term, as applicable, at which point this Agreement will automatically terminate.\n\n\n\nWithin 30 days of the end of the Initial Term, and within 30 days of the end of each Renewal Term, both parties hereto shall have the right renegotiate the fee specified below for the use of the vessels.

Customer agrees that aspects of the Software and associated Documentation, including the specific design and structure of individual programs, are trade secrets and/or copyrighted materials of Cisco, its suppliers or licensors.

In the event such audit discloses non-compliance with this Agreement, Customer shall promptly pay to Cisco the appropriate license fees.\n\nExport. Software, including technical data, may be subject to U.S. export control laws, including the U.S. Export Administration Act and its associated regulations, and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. Customer agrees to comply strictly with all such regulations and acknowledges that it has the responsibility to obtain licenses to export, re-export, or import Software.\n\nGovernment End User Purchasers.

In addition, due to the continual development of new techniques for intruding upon and attacking networks, Cisco does not warrant that the Software or any equipment, system or network on which the Software is used will be free of vulnerability to intrusion or attack.\n\nRestrictions. This warranty does not apply if the Software, Product or any other equipment upon which the Software is authorized to be used (a) has been altered, except by Cisco, (b) has not been installed, operated, repaired, or maintained in accordance with instructions supplied by Cisco, (c) has been subjected to abnormal physical or electrical stress, misuse, negligence, or accident; or (d) is licensed, for beta, evaluation, testing or demonstration purposes for which Cisco does not charge a purchase price or license fee.\n\nDISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

(\"FIIOC\") and NEW YORK LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITY CORPORATION (\"Company\").\n\nWHEREAS, FIIOC provides transfer agency and other services to Fidelity's Variable Insurance Products Fund, Variable Insurance Products Fund II and Variable Insurance Products Fund III (collectively \"Funds\"); and\n\nWHEREAS, the services provided by FIIOC on behalf of the Funds include responding to inquiries about the Funds including the provision of information about the Funds' investment objectives, investment policies, portfolio holdings, etc.; and\n\nWHEREAS, Company holds shares of the Funds in order to fund certain variable annuity contracts, group annuity contracts, and/or variable life insurance policies, the beneficial interests in which are held by individuals, plan trustees, or others who look to Company to provide information about the Funds similar to the information provided by FIIOC; and\n\nWHEREAS, the Company and one or more of the Funds have entered into one or more Participation Agreements, under which the Company agrees not to provide information about the Funds except for information provided by the Funds or their designees; and\n\nWHEREAS, FIIOC and Company desire that Company be able to respond to inquiries about the Funds from individual variable annuity owners, participants in group annuity contracts issued by the Company, and owners and participants under variable life insurance policies issued by the Company, and prospective customers for any of the above; and\n\nWHEREAS, FIIOC and Company recognize that Company's efforts in responding to customer inquiries will reduce the burden that such inquiries would place on FIIOC should such inquiries be directed to FIIOC.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, the parties do agree as follows:\n\n1. Information to be Provided to Company. FIIOC agrees to provide to Company, on a periodic basis, directly or through a designee, information about the Funds' investment objectives, investment policies, portfolio holdings, performance, etc. The content and format of such information shall be as FIIOC, in its sole discretion, shall choose. FIIOC may change the format and/or content of such informational reports, and the frequency with which such information is provided. For purposes of Section 4.2 of each of the Company's Participation Agreement(s) with the Funds, FIIOC represents that it is the designee of the Funds, and Company may therefore use the information provided by FIIOC without seeking additional permission from the Funds.\n\n2. Use of Information by Company. Company may use the information provided by FIIOC in communications to individuals, plan trustees, or others who have legal title or beneficial interest in the annuity or life insurance products issued by Company, or representatives of any of these parties, and to prospective purchasers of such products or beneficial interests thereunder. If such information is contained as part of larger pieces of sales literature, advertising, etc., such pieces shall be furnished for review to the Funds in accordance with the terms of the Company's Participation Agreements with the Funds. Nothing herein shall give the Company the right to expand upon, alter the appearance of, or otherwise alter the information provided by FIIOC. Company acknowledges that the information provided it by FIIOC may\n\n\n\n\n\nneed to be supplemented with additional qualifying information, regulatory disclaimers, or other information before it may be conveyed to persons outside the Company.\n\n3. Compensation to Company. In recognition of the fact that Company will respond to inquiries that otherwise would be handled by FIIOC, FIIOC agrees to pay Company a quarterly fee computed as follows:\n\nAt the close of each calendar quarter, FIIOC will determine the Average Daily Assets held in the Funds by the Company. Average Daily Assets shall be the sum of the daily assets for each calendar day in the quarter divided by the number of calendar days in the quarter. The Average Daily Assets shall be multiplied by [ ] ([ ] basis points) and that sum shall be divided by four. The resulting number shall be the quarterly fee for that quarter, which shall be paid to Company during the following month.\n\nShould any Participation Agreement(s) between Company and any Fund(s) be terminated effective before the last day of a quarter, Company shall be entitled to a fee for that portion of the quarter during which the Participation Agreement was still in effect, unless such termination is due to misconduct on the part of the Company. For such a stub quarter, Average Daily Assets shall be the sum of the daily assets for each calendar day in the quarter through and including the date of termination of the Participation Agreement(s), divided by the number of calendar days in that quarter for which the Participation Agreement was in effect. Such Average Daily Assets shall be multiplied by [ ] ([ ] basis points) and that number shall be multiplied by the number of days in such quarter that the Participation Agreement was in effect, then divided by three hundred sixty-five. The resulting number shall be the quarterly fee for the stub quarter, which shall be paid to Company during the following month.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, compensation for each calendar quarter will not exceed [ ].\n\n4. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated by Company at any time upon written notice to FIIOC. FIIOC may terminate this Agreement at any time upon ninety (90) days' written notice to Company. FIIOC may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to Company (1) if required by any applicable law or regulation, (2) if so required by action of the Fund(s) Board of Trustees, or (3) if Company engages in any material breach of this Agreement.

REGARDING DEVELOPMENT OF WATER WELL(S) IN THE CAPITAN REEF AQUIFER FORMATION\n\nThis AGREEMENT regarding development of water well(s) in the Capitan Reef Aquifer Formation (the \"AGREEMENT\") is entered into by the City of Fort Stockton, Texas, a Texas Type A-General Law city (\"COFS\") and STW Resources Holding Corp., a Nevada corporation (\"STW\"), effective as of the last date of signature on the signature pages below. STW and COFS are sometimes individually referred to as a \"Party\" and collectively referred to as the \"Parties.\"\n\nWHEREAS, the City of Fort Stockton, Texas (\"COFS\") owns the surface and groundwater rights to several areas of the Capitan Reef Aquifer Formation; and\n\nWHEREAS, COFS has an existing Capitan Reef Aquifer (\"CRA\") water well located at Section 112 on COFS property, which is currently drilled to an approximate depth of 3,500 feet (the \"Existing CRA Well\"), and also owns property at Section 71; and\n\nWHEREAS, STW desires to attempt to deepen the Existing CRA Well in order to make it a producing water well and/or drill an alternate well(s) at its own expense, and to lease CRA groundwater rights from Sections 112 and 71 of COFS property; and   WHEREAS, STW and COFS desire to work together for the development of a CRA water supply project within the area that will serve to meet the future needs of COFS and the municipal and industrial needs within the region.\n\nTHE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE AS FOLLOWS:\n\n1.  Leasing of Property  and Drilling  of Water Well(s). COFS hereby grants, leases and lets unto STW the right to explore for, drill for, produce, utilize, transport, and treat groundwater from the CRA only from beneath the surface of the property more specifically described in Exhibit \"A,\" which is attached hereto and fully incorporated into this AGREEMENT (hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Property\"). STW is further authorized to drill, deepen, and/or rework at its expense the Existing CRA Well on Section 112 of the Property from its current depth of approximately 3,500 feet to approximately 4,000 feet, so as to determine the following to be verified by a study to be performed by a hydrogeologist mutually agreed upon by both Parties (\"Post-Well Study\"): (a) the gallons per day (\"GPD\") of maximum water capacity of the Existing CRA Well or alternate well, as may be required under Section 5 of the AGREEMENT; and (b) the quality of the water to be obtained from the Existing CRA Well or alternate well. The rights granted to STW under this AGREEMENT also include the right of access to the Property to perform the activities authorized herein.   2.  Acces s and Surface Use. STW agrees to coordinate reasonably with COFS with respect to location of any new wells, roadways, power infrastructure, and other improvements that are to be constructed or used on the Property. COFS shall provide STW rent free site leases for the commercially reasonable amounts of surface area required for CRA pumping and filling stations located on the Property. STW shall pay for or repair all actual damages to roads, fences, or improvements caused by its activities on the Property within sixty (60) days of the occurrence, and will fill and level all pits, mounds, ruts, and shall restore the surface to as near its original condition as is reasonably practicable within ninety (90) days after termination of the provisions of this AGREEMENT related only to the Property. Upon termination of the provisions of this AGREEMENT related to the Property only, STW, or its successors or assigns, shall transfer title of all water conveyance pipelines from the Property to COFS. STW shall administer and provide all necessary and reasonable insurance to insure its activities on the Property in relation to the AGREEMENT and shall list COFS as additional insured.\n\n  -1-\n\n\n\n\n\n    3.  Term.  Subject to the other provisions contained herein, this AGREEMENT shall be for a term of thirty (30) years from the Effective Date, which shall automatically renew from year-to-year thereafter unless terminated by a Party upon sixty (60) days' written notice after the end of the term. Notwithstanding the 30-year term of this agreement, should STW procure sales agreements with customers for a duration of longer than 30 years, STW shall be authorized to maintain and service such contract(s) to the extent of the water volume(s) purchased, and this AGREEMENT shall not terminate during the initial term of any such water supply agreement with a term extending beyond this AGREEMENT.   4.  Post-Well  Study Generally. The Post-Well Study shall provide information on the feasibility of developing a water well field in that location that would produce water from the CRA for: (a) the availability of a minimum 1,200 gallons per minute (\"GPM\") per day CRA water production for STW, its successors or assignees, to sell to communities and users within a 500-mile radius outside of COFS (the \"Permitted Sale Water\") during the Term, with the further requirement that STW would be responsible for the pipelines and pumping facilities required to transport the Permitted Sale Water to the intended end-users; and that all such water obtained from the Existing CRA Well contains acceptable levels of Total Dissolved Solids (\"TDS\") to meet municipal use standards. If such water does not meet municipal use standards according to the Post-Well Study, STW may either treat the water to municipal use standards or to sell it as-is to industrial end-users.   5.  Replacement CRA Well. If, based on the Post-Well Study of the Existing CRA Well, it is determined that the Existing CRA Well is not suitable for the purposes of this AGREEMENT, then STW may elect to drill at its expense a second water well (the \"Replacement CRA Well\") at a place to be mutually agreed on the Property, with the Existing CRA Well to remain as a monitoring well. After completion of the Replacement CRA Well, a second Post-Well Study will be conducted for the same purposes as that for the Existing CRA Well.   6.  Construction Requirements. STW's construction of the improvements to the Existing CRA Well, any Replacement CRA Well, and any additional production wells shall be pursuant to any recommendation and requirements as may be specified by and agreed upon with COFS, and the construction shall also be conducted in a manner meeting prevailing industry standards, the Middle Pecos Groundwater Conservation District regulations, Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) regulations, and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) regulations.   7.  Cooperation  Regarding  Studies. COFS shall provide to STW any and all documents pertaining to this project, including all hydrogeological studies and any existing Pre-Well Studies for the Existing CRA Well, as well as any similar documents for the Replacement CRA Well to include:   a.  the best location for the Replacement CRA Well on the Property, considering the spacing with any other wells that might now or in the future be located on the Property;   b.  the location on the Property that will best provide data for determining the feasibility of pumping water from the CRA on the Property and be the most productive;   c.  documents showing current ownership of the Property including both CRA and surface ownership rights, to demonstrate COFS' ability to lease the land for the Sale of CRA Water Rights to STW, including any documents showing the prior sale or conveyance of any CRA or water rights from the Property; and   d.  names and addresses of engineers and/or hydrogeologists recommended to perform the Post-Well Study (ies). The Post-Well Study (ies) shall be performed by a hydrogeologist(s) mutually agreed to by both Parties.\n\n  -2-\n\n\n\n\n\n    8.  Post-Well Study Requirements. Any Post-Well Studies shall be paid for by STW and shall include:   a.  a chemical analysis and performance by a qualified certified laboratory mutually approved by the Parties to determine the quality of the water and its characteristics at that location;   b.  any documents related to the drawdown or recharge rate affecting the producing capacity; and   c.  TDS measurements of CRA water produced by STW.   9.  COFS Responsibilities.   COFS shall perform the following services:   a.  administer and provide all necessary insurance to insure its activities in relation to the AGREEMENT; and   b.  possess or obtain any and all necessary property rights for the activities covered in this AGREEMENT, including both CRA and surface rights to the Property.   10.  Construction and Post-Well Study Costs.  STW will pay all reasonable and necessary costs to: (a) construct the improvements to the Existing CRA Well or the Replacement CRA Well (including the cost of securing any necessary regulatory approval for the improvements to the Existing CRA Well and the Replacement CRA Well); (b) obtain the Post-Well Study (ies); and (c) reasonable consulting costs related to the negotiation and execution of the AGREEMENT.   11.  STW Termination Rights. STW shall have the right to unilaterally terminate the provisions of this AGREEMENT related only to the Property, and not proceed further after the completion of any phase of the project and not incur any additional costs. So long as STW is progressing through the following phases, and subject to the other terms of this AGREEMENT, COFS may not terminate the AGREEMENT during the:   a.  Pre-well study (ies),   b.  completion of improvements to the Existing CRA Well,   c.  completion of the Replacement CRA Well, if necessary, and   d.  Post-Well Study (ies).   Should COFS unilaterally terminate the provisions of this AGREEMENT related to COFS Property only, with the right to do so beginning on a period beginning no sooner than ninety (90) days following the Post-Well Study (ies), and ending at the one year period following the Post-Well Study (ies), during which STW may exercise its Option to Produce Water, in accordance with Section 15 of this AGREEMENT, COFS shall reimburse STW for 100% of the costs paid by STW up to the point of such termination, pursuant to the AGREEMENT, according to a reasonable accounting schedule of costs prepared by STW and submitted to COFS. Once STW exercises its Option to Produce Water pursuant to Section 15 of this AGREEMENT, and pays COFS its Bonus Payment, in accordance with Section 14(b) of this AGREEMENT, COFS may no longer unilaterally terminate this AGREEMENT during the Term. If STW terminates the AGREEMENT and COFS sells water within twenty (20) years from the Effective Date of this AGREEMENT from one or more producing water well(s) developed by STW, STW shall be reimbursed the amount expended for drilling the producing well(s), to be paid from the sale of water produced by COFS from the producing well(s). Such reimbursement shall occur based on COFS' net revenues received from CRA water sales from the producing well(s) in six (6) month increments, which shall begin on the date COFS begins selling CRA water from producing water well(s), and shall end upon reimbursement in full of the amount STW is owed for drilling any producing well(s).\n\n  -3-\n\n\n\n\n\n    12.  Title of Producing Wells. Title and ownership of the Existing CRA Well, the Replacement CRA Well and any additional wells drilled on the Property by STW (the \"Additional Wells\") shall be transferred to STW by COFS and shall be held by STW; however, upon termination of the provisions of this AGREEMENT that relate to COFS Property, STW shall transfer the title(s) back to COFS upon COFS' reimbursement of STW as necessary under this AGREEMENT.   13.  Uses, Maintenance, Construction and Operation of Wells. STW will construct, maintain, operate, own, and repair (as needed) the Existing CRA Well, the Replacement CRA Well and any Additional Wells, and in doing so, and in the wells' operation and repair, STW shall:   a.  conduct all work and operations in a businesslike manner consistent with good and economical practices and with due regard for good land management, damage prevention and environmental protection;   b.  comply with all federal, state, and local laws, regulations and requirements governing the development, production, collection, transportation, and disposal of the water (and any waste or reject water);   c.  allow COFS or its authorized representatives to enter upon the premises at reasonable times to be arranged in advance of entry; and   d.  plug all wells, when abandoned, in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements of the Middle Pecos Groundwater Conservation District, TDLR, and/or TCEQ.   14.  Obligations Following the Post-Well Study.   a.  For purposes of this section, the Post-Well Study must show that the Existing CRA Well or Replacement CRA Well can produce CRA water at a minimum of 1,200 GPM or more or a combination of 1,200 GPM from one or more wells on the Property in order for STW to proceed with the obligations set forth in this section (\"Critical Criterion\").   b.  Obligations if Post-Well Study shows that the Critical Criterion has been met:   If all necessary regulatory approvals are obtained that allow the production and transport of up to 10 million GPD or the maximum capacity of the well, for STW's use or resale, in conjunction with STW exercising its Option to Produce Water under Section 15 of this AGREEMENT, STW will pay COFS an upfront Bonus Payment of Five Million and 00/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00), and STW shall have the immediate right to develop Additional Wells on the Property, subject to all necessary regulatory approvals, in the event STW procures additional water supply contracts that require additional volume of production, the feasibility of which shall be by a Post Well hydrogeological study and report that shows the ability of STW to produce the additional amounts of CRA water. STW shall have the right to the sale of and transport of such additional water produced from Additional Wells. STW shall pay COFS a seventeen percent (17%) royalty of the price STW receives per 1,000 gallons of CRA water produced from the Property and sold.   STW shall also provide to COFS three (3) million GPD of CRA water at no cost to COFS at such time that COFS requests delivery of the water for COFS use. Each payment made by STW to COFS will include an accounting statement providing the number of gallons sold, the price paid by any customer(s), the gross revenues received by STW, and the expenses paid by STW for the sale, treatment, use, and/or delivery of the CRA water. STW shall calculate the amount owed to COFS every one hundred-eighty (180) days (\"Accrual Period\"), and shall provide required payments to COFS within thirty (30) days after the end of the previous Accrual Period.\n\n  -4-\n\n\n\n\n\n    c.  Options if Post-Well Study shows that the Critical Criterion has not been met:   (1)  STW may choose to not pursue the production and transport of the water from the Property. If one or more producing wells are developed by STW and COFS sells the CRA water produced from the well(s), COFS will reimburse STW from the net revenues COFS receives up to the point STW has been fully reimbursed for drilling any producing well(s) if such sale occurs within twenty (20) years from the date of this AGREEMENT.   (2)  STW may choose to pursue the production and transport of the water. STW shall have the right to produce and transport the water upon obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals, and will not seek reimbursement of any of its costs incurred pursuant to the AGREEMENT.   (3)  If regulatory approvals have been granted, but the permit obtained from the Middle Pecos Groundwater Conservation District allows the transport of less than the full amount requested for STW's use or sale, then STW may:   i.  elect to produce and transport the water; or   ii.  elect to not produce and transport the water, in which case the conditions of Subsection (c)(1) of this section shall apply.   15.  Option to Produce Water.   a.  STW will have one year from completion of the last of the Post-Well Study (ies) completed on the Existing CRA Well or Replacement CRA Well to exercise its option to produce and transport the water produced from the CRA on the Property (\"Option to Produce\"). The AGREEMENT shall thereafter terminate as to both Parties if STW has not exercised its Option to Produce at the expiration of the one-year period unless STW pays as royalty on the first day of each month the sum of Five Hundred and 00/100 Dollars ($500.00) per month. STW shall have no right to maintain this AGREEMENT through payment of such a royalty for any one period greater than three consecutive years.   b.  If, after STW has exercised its option to produce CRA water from the Property, one or more producing wells on the Property are capable of producing CRA water for sale, but CRA water is not being sold for a consecutive period of 180 days or more, then the lease shall terminate as to both parties unless STW pays as royalty on the first day of each month after such period of 180 days, the sum of Five Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($5,000) per month. STW shall have no right to maintain this AGREEMENT through payment of such a royalty for any one period greater than three (3) consecutive years.   c.  If STW exercises its option to produce and transport the CRA water, STW will construct additional facilities or expand existing facilities, as necessary, to be able to produce and transport the CRA water for sale.     -5-\n\n\n\n\n\n    16.  Payment for Use of COFS Pipeline Easements and COFS Assistance with Project.   a.  STW shall be entitled to use existing COFS easements and right of ways within Pecos County for laying of pipelines necessary for the delivery of CRA water produced within Pecos County. COFS will assist STW with any negotiations required to procure any additional easements and groundwater rights in Pecos County that are necessary for the production and delivery of CRA water. STW shall also be entitled to use and upgrade existing COFS water treatment infrastructure as necessary for the treatment of raw CRA water. STW shall pay COFS a seven percent (7%) royalty of the price STW receives per 1,000 gallons of CRA water produced from other properties within Pecos County and sold as consideration for the rights provided by COFS to STW under this subsection. Such payment shall be made according to the schedule and terms set forth in Section 14(b) of this AGREEMENT. The requirements under this Section 16 shall remain in force and effect despite any termination of those provisions of this AGREEMENT that apply only to COFS Property. The provisions of this section shall terminate in the event STW is not producing CRA water from other properties in Pecos County for sale due to termination of all such agreements or failure of STW to enter into such agreements regarding other properties in Pecos County within ten (10) years from the Effective Date of this AGREEMENT.   b.  COFS shall manage well maintenance and production operations for all CRA water produced within Pecos County under the direction of STW. STW shall pay COFS for its reasonable costs incurred to manage such well maintenance and production operations.   c.  STW shall conduct all necessary storage, holding, and treatment of CRA water produced from the Property and from other properties within Pecos County, as set forth in Subsection (a) of this section, within the boundaries of Pecos County.   17.  Authorized Third Party Beneficiary.   STW shall be listed as a third party beneficiary to any contracts to guarantee payment of any of the obligations of this contract between COFS and Pecos County or any other entity or individual.   18.  Venue. This AGREEMENT is controlled by the laws of the State of Texas, and venue for any actions brought to enforce this AGREEMENT shall be brought exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction in Pecos County, Texas.   19.

STW shall pay all taxes, fees, assessments, and costs associated with the rights, pumping, and use of the CRA water from the Property and other properties in Pecos County. COFS shall bear and pay any ad valorem taxes assessed directly against COFS' royalty, any federal or state income taxes payable on the royalty and on the other compensation payable to COFS under this AGREEMENT, and taxes assessed on COFS' ownership of the surface of the Property and other minerals not conveyed under this AGREEMENT.   21.  Governmental Authority. STW shall be responsible for obtaining any approval required from any applicable governmental authority with jurisdiction over the activities under this AGREEMENT. COFS shall assist STW with any documentation needed to obtain the necessary approvals required.\n\n  -6-\n\n\n\n\n\n    22.  Force Majeure. If a Party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, to carry out any of its obligations under the Agreement, other than an obligation to pay money, as a result of Force Majeure, then its obligations shall be suspended, to the extent affected by such Force Majeure, during the continuance of any inability so caused, provided that notice of the Force Majeure is provided to the other Party as soon as reasonably practicable. The Party claiming the Force Majeure shall use due diligence to resume performance at the earliest practicable time, and such suspension shall not extend for a period longer than twenty-four (24) months from the date notice of the Force Majeure is provided without payment as set forth under Section 15(a) of this AGREEMENT by STW, or the option to terminate this AGREEMENT by STW if COFS is the party asserting the Force Majeure.   23.  Notice of Breach. In the event of default by any Party, a non-defaulting party may give the defaulting party written notice specifying the default. If the defaulting party fails to fully cure any monetary default that can be cured by payment within sixty (60) days after receipt of the notice, or fails to commence the curing of any default specified in such notice that is other than a monetary default within sixty (60) days from the date of the notice provided, then the non-defaulting party may pursue all legal or equitable remedies against the defaulting party.   24.

Support Period Covenants.\n\n(a) During the period commencing on the date hereof and ending at 11:59 pm New York Time on the date that is thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the advance notice period for the submission by stockholders of director nominations for consideration at the Company's 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the \"2021 Annual Meeting\") as determined by applicable law and set forth in the Bylaws (such period, as modified, if applicable, in Section 4(b) below, the \"Support Period\"), the Marathon Parties shall appear in person or by proxy for quorum purposes at the 2020 Annual Meeting and any other meeting of stockholders of the Company, including any adjournment or postponement thereof, to vote all of the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Marathon Parties on the record date for such meeting (i) in favor of all persons nominated by the Board to serve as directors of the Company and against any stockholder nominated candidate not endorsed by the Board, (ii) to ratify the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, (iii) in accordance with the Board's recommendation with respect to the Company's \"say-on-pay\" proposal and compensation plans and any amendments thereto and (iv) in favor of any other proposals recommended by the Board, provided, that with respect to any extraordinary matter, including any merger, acquisition, recapitalization, restructuring, financing, disposition, distribution, spin-off, asset sale, joint venture or other business combination involving the Company or its subsidiaries which requires a vote of the Company's stockholders, the Marathon Parties shall have the right to vote the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Marathon Parties in their sole discretion. The Marathon Parties shall provide written evidence of such vote to the Company no later than ten (10) business days prior to the 2020 Annual Meeting.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if either:\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) at any time between the date of this Agreement and the date that is thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the advance notice period for the submission by stockholders of director nominations for consideration at the 2021 Annual Meeting as determined by applicable law and set forth in the Bylaws (such date, the \"2021 Annual Meeting Nomination Window Date\"), the Marathon Parties do not meet the Minimum Ownership Threshold (as defined below), or\n\n(ii) as of the 2021 Annual Meeting Nomination Window Date, all of the following conditions have been met:\n\na. if the New Director or her Replacement is a director on the Board as of the 2021 Annual Meeting Nomination Window Date, the New Director or her Replacement (as applicable) is a member of the Nominating Committee as of such date,\n\nb. between the date of this Agreement and the 2021 Annual Meeting Nomination Window Date, Tarang Amin has not entered into a voting agreement or similar agreement that would subject any Securities of the Company beneficially owned by Mr. Amin to any arrangement or agreement with respect to the voting thereof with any other person that is a holder of any Securities of the Company and that is not affiliated with Mr. Amin or his estate planning, or that would give Mr. Amin the power to vote or direct the voting of any Securities of the Company beneficially owned by any other person that is not affiliated with Mr. Amin or his estate planning,\n\nc. between the date of this Agreement and the 2021 Annual Meeting Nomination Window Date, the Company has not issued shares of Common Stock (and/or Securities of the Company convertible into, or exercisable for, shares of Common Stock) in any transaction that represents more than 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock (including any Securities of the Company convertible into, or exercisable for, shares of Common Stock) immediately prior to such issuance,\n\nd. the Company has confirmed that the proxy statement for the 2021 Annual Meeting shall include language describing the obligation of the Company set forth in Section 1(h) above as relates to annual grants of equity awards to executive officers of the Company in 2022, and\n\ne. the Company has confirmed that any director(s) or officer(s) of the Company who beneficially owned 3% or more of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the record date for the 2020 Annual Meeting voted all such shares at the 2020 Annual Meeting in favor of annual \"say-on-pay\" proposal frequency at future annual meetings of the Company,\n\nthen, for all purposes under this Agreement, the Support Period shall not expire on the 2021 Annual Meeting Nomination Window Date, and instead the Support Period shall automatically be extended until 11:59 pm New York Time on the date that is thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the advance notice period for the submission by stockholders of director nominations for consideration at the Company's 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders as determined by applicable law and set forth in the Bylaws for all purposes under this Agreement, and the Marathon Parties shall be required to (x) appear in person or by proxy at the 2021 Annual Meeting or any other meeting of stockholders of the Company held on or after the 2021 Annual Meeting Nomination Window Date and prior to the end of the Support Period, (y) vote any of the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Marathon Parties in accordance with Section 4(a)(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) at any meeting of stockholders of the Company held on or after the 2021 Annual Meeting Nomination Window Date and prior to the end of the Support Period, provided, however, that in the event that Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (\"ISS\") recommends otherwise with respect to the Company's \"say-on-pay\" proposal or any proposal relating to any compensation plan submitted for shareholder approval at the 2021 Annual Meeting, including any amendments thereto, each of the Marathon Parties will be permitted to vote in accordance with the ISS\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\nrecommendation in its discretion, and (z) provide written evidence of such vote by the Marathon Parties at any meeting of stockholders of the Company held on or after the 2021 Annual Meeting Nomination Window Date and prior to the end of the Support Period (including the 2021 Annual Meeting) no later than ten (10) business days prior to any such meeting (including the 2021 Annual Meeting). As used herein, the \"Minimum Ownership Threshold\" shall mean beneficial ownership equal to or greater than 2.0% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. The Marathon Parties shall provide notice to the Company within two business days following the date on which the Marathon Parties no longer meet the Minimum Ownership Threshold.\n\n(c) If at any time during the Support Period (x) the New Director is unable to serve out her term as a Class III Director on the Board for any reason, and (y) as of such time, the Marathon Parties have maintained since the date of this Agreement the Minimum Ownership Threshold and the Marathon Parties have provided evidence of such ownership, together with a certification of such ownership, to the Company, then the Marathon Parties and the Company shall negotiate in good faith to propose a mutually-agreed upon replacement director (the \"Replacement\") to be appointed to the Board to serve as her successor for the remainder of her current term as a Class III Director in accordance with the Bylaws, provided such Replacement (i) qualifies as \"independent\" pursuant to the rules and listing standards of the NYSE and applicable SEC rules and regulations, (ii) has provided the Company with the Information, (iii) has cooperated with a background check and (iv) has executed all documents required to be executed by directors of the Company. The Replacement shall be promptly appointed to the Board and at least one standing committee of the Board, subject to the approval by each of the Nominating Committee and the Board, after conducting a good faith customary due diligence process and consistent with the Board's fiduciary duties.\n\n5.

provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Marathon Parties from making a public statement about how they intend to vote and the reasons therefor with respect to any Extraordinary Transaction to which any executive officer or director of the Company is a party (other than customary support agreements) and that requires a vote of the Company's stockholders; provided further, that this clause shall not preclude the tender by the Marathon Parties or any of their Affiliates or Associates of any Securities of the Company into any tender or exchange offer which has been approved and recommended to stockholders of the Company by the Board;\n\n(viii) (A) seek or solicit support for (whether publicly or privately) any written consent of stockholders of the Company, (B) seek representation on, or nominate any candidate to, the Board, except as set forth in Section 1 of this Agreement, (C) seek the removal of any member of the Board, (D) conduct a referendum of stockholders, (E) institute any litigation against the Company, its directors or its officers other than to (1) enforce the provisions of this Agreement and (2) make counterclaims with respect to any proceeding initiated by, or on behalf of, the Company against the Marathon Parties, or (F) make a request for any stockholder list or other Company books and records, whether pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law or otherwise;\n\n(ix) knowingly encourage, advise or influence any other person or assist any Third Party in so encouraging, assisting or influencing any person or entity with respect to the giving or withholding of any proxy vote at the 2020 Annual Meeting or the 2021 Annual Meeting (including any \"vote no\" or \"withhold vote\" or similar campaign);\n\n(x) take any action in support of or make any proposal or request that constitutes: (A) advising, controlling, changing or influencing the Board or management of the Company, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any vacancies on the Board or unfilled newly-created directorships;

The Marathon Parties shall provide the Company with a detailed agenda of discussion topics for the portion of the Quarterly Investor Conference Call with the Lead Independent Director no later than three business days prior to the date of such Quarterly Investor Conference Call.

No delay on the part of either Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of either Party of any right, power or privilege hereunder operate as a waiver of any other right, power or privilege hereunder, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.\n\n(c) Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and assigns of each of the parties. This Agreement may not be assigned without the prior written consent of the other Party hereto.\n\n(d) No Third-Party Beneficiaries.

If at any time subsequent to the date hereof, any provision of this Agreement shall be held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, such provision shall be of no force and effect, but the illegality or unenforceability of such provision shall have no effect upon the legality or enforceability of any other provision in this Agreement.\n\n(j) Interpretation and Construction.

Where any sum due to be paid to either Party hereunder is subject to any withholding or similar tax, the Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to do all such acts and things and to sign all such documents as will enable them to take advantage of any applicable double taxation agreement or treaty. In the event there is no applicable double taxation agreement or treaty, or if an applicable double taxation agreement or treaty reduces but does not eliminate such withholding or similar tax, the payor shall remit such withholding or similar tax to the appropriate government authority, deduct the amount paid from the amount due to payee and secure and send to payee the best available evidence of the payment of such withholding or similar tax.

Harpoon shall (a) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an exemption of such withheld amounts to the extent practicable under Applicable Law and (b) cooperate with AbbVie to obtain a reduction or refund of such withheld amounts.\n\n6.9 Indirect Taxes.

Such examinations may not (a) be conducted for any [***] [***] (b) be conducted more than once in any [***] period or (c) be [***] (unless a previous audit revealed an underpayment with respect to such [***]).

Where a Party brings such an action in accordance with this Agreement, the other Party shall, where necessary, furnish a power of attorney solely for such purpose or shall join in, or be named as a necessary party to, such action. Unless otherwise set forth herein, the Party entitled to bring any patent infringement litigation in accordance with this Section 7.3 shall have the right to settle such claim; provided that neither Party shall have the right to settle any patent infringement litigation under this Section 7.3 in a manner that imposes any costs or liability on, or involves any admission by, the other Party, without the express written consent of such other Party.

Subject to Section 11.2, AbbVie shall have the first right, but not the obligation, to defend and control the defense of any such claim, suit, or proceeding at its own expense, using counsel of its own choice. Harpoon may participate in any such claim, suit, or proceeding with counsel of its choice at its own expense. The assumption of the defense of a claim that may be subject to Section 11.2 by either AbbVie or Harpoon shall not be construed as an acknowledgment that Harpoon is liable to indemnify any AbbVie Indemnitee in respect of such indemnity claim, nor shall it constitute a waiver by Harpoon of any defenses it may assert against an AbbVie Indemnitee's claim for indemnification. Without limitation of the foregoing, if AbbVie finds it necessary or desirable to join Harpoon as a party to any such action, Harpoon shall, at AbbVie's expense, execute all papers and perform such acts as shall be reasonably required. If AbbVie elects (in a written communication submitted to Harpoon within a reasonable amount of time after notice of the alleged patent infringement) not to defend or control the defense of, or otherwise fails to initiate and maintain the defense of, any such claim, suit, or proceeding, within such time periods so that Harpoon is not prejudiced by any delays, Harpoon may conduct and control the defense of any such claim, suit, or proceeding at its own expense.

AbbVie may participate in any such claim, suit, or proceeding in the Territory with counsel of its choice at its own expense; provided that Harpoon shall retain control of the defense in such claim, suit, or proceeding. If Harpoon elects not to defend or control the defense of such Harpoon Patents in a suit brought in the Territory, or otherwise fails to initiate and maintain the defense of any such claim, suit, or proceeding, then solely with respect to Product-Specific Patents included in the Harpoon Patents, and subject to Section 7.5.2(b), AbbVie may request to conduct and control the defense of any such claim, suit, or proceeding at its own expense, with Harpoon's consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.\n\n(b) On and after the License Option Exercise Closing Date, AbbVie shall have the responsibility for and control over the defense of the validity, patentability and enforceability of Product-Specific Patents at AbbVie's sole cost and expense. Harpoon may participate in any such claim, suit, or proceeding in the Territory with counsel of its choice at its own expense; provided that AbbVie shall retain control of the defense in such claim, suit, or proceeding.

The other Party may participate in any such claim, suit, or proceeding in the Territory related to the Joint Patents with counsel of its choice at its own expense; provided that the Party who is prosecuting the Joint Patents at the relevant time shall retain control of the defense in such claim, suit, or proceeding. If the Party who is prosecuting the Joint Patents at the relevant time elects not to defend or control the defense of the Joint Patents in a suit brought in the Territory, or otherwise fails to initiate and maintain the defense of any such claim, suit, or proceeding, then the other Party may conduct and control the defense of any such claim, suit, or proceeding, at its own expense.\n\n7.5.4 Cooperation. Each Party shall assist and cooperate with the other Party as such other Party may reasonably request from time to time in connection with its activities set forth in this Section 7.5, including by being joined as a party plaintiff in such action or proceeding, providing access to relevant documents and other evidence, and making its employees available at reasonable business hours. In connection with any such defense or claim or counterclaim, the controlling Party shall consider in good faith any comments from the other Party and shall keep the other Party reasonably informed of any steps taken, and shall provide copies of all documents filed, in connection with such defense, claim, or counterclaim provided that doing so would not waive any privilege or violate any court order or Applicable Law. In connection with the activities set forth in this Section 7.5, each Party shall consult with the other as to the strategy for the defense of the Harpoon Patents and Joint Patents. Neither Party shall have the right to settle any claim, suit, or proceeding under this Section 7.5 in a manner that imposes any costs or liability on, or involves any admission by, the other Party, without the express written consent of such other Party.\n\n7.5.5 Relationship to Enforcement of Patents. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the defense to any challenge of validity, enforceability or patentability of any of the Harpoon Patents, AbbVie Patents, or Joint Patents that is raised in connection with or in response to an infringement action or a biosimilar litigation shall be controlled by the Party who controls that infringement action or biosimilar litigation, and such Party shall have the right to manage, resolve, settle or dispose any such challenge according to Section 7.3, provided that (a) with respect to any Harpoon Patents that are not Product- Specific Patents and are not involved in any biosimilar patent litigation, where AbbVie is the controlling Party in connection with an infringement action, AbbVie shall not resolve, settle or dispose of such action or litigation in any way that would admit liability on the part of Harpoon, or materially impact the validity, scope or enforceability of such Harpoon Patent, without Harpoon's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (b) with respect to any Harpoon Patents for which Harpoon did not give its consent to include within a biosimilar litigation, and Harpoon is the controlling Party in connection with an infringement action involving such Patents, then Harpoon shall be the controlling Party in connection with the defense to any challenge of validity, enforceability or patentability of such Harpoon Patents, but shall reasonably consult with AbbVie in connection with any such defense, and shall consider in good faith AbbVie's reasonable comments in relation thereto.\n\n7.6 Product Trademarks.

All information exchanged between the Parties regarding the prosecution, maintenance, enforcement and defense of Patents under this Article 7 will be deemed to be Confidential Information of the disclosing Party. In addition, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, with regard to such prosecution, maintenance, enforcement and defense, the interests of the Parties as collaborators and Harpoon and licensee are to, for their mutual benefit, obtain patent protection and plan patent defense against potential infringement activities by Third Parties, and as such, are aligned and are legal in nature. The Parties agree and acknowledge that they have not waived, and nothing in this Agreement constitutes a waiver of, any legal privilege concerning Patents under this Article 7, including privilege under the common interest doctrine and similar or related doctrines. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent a Party has a good faith belief that any information required to be disclosed by such Party to the other Party under this Article 7 is protected by attorney-client privilege or any other applicable legal privilege or immunity, such Party shall not be required to disclose such information and the Parties shall in good faith cooperate to agree upon a procedure (which may include entering into a specific common interest agreement, disclosing such information on a \"for counsel eyes only\" basis or similar procedure) under which such information may be disclosed without waiving or breaching such privilege or immunity.\n\nARTICLE 8 PHARMACOVIGILANCE AND SAFETY\n\n8.1 Pharmacovigilance.

All indemnification claims in respect of a Party, its Affiliates, or their respective directors, officers, employees and agents shall be made solely by such Party to this Agreement (the \"Indemnified Party\"). The Indemnified Party shall give the indemnifying Party prompt written notice (an \"Indemnification Claim Notice\") of any Losses or discovery of fact upon which such Indemnified Party intends to base a request for indemnification under this Article 11, but in no event shall the indemnifying Party be liable for any Losses to the extent resulting from any delay in providing such notice. Each Indemnification Claim Notice must contain a description of the claim and the nature and amount of such Loss (to the extent\n\n- 59 -\n\nSource: HARPOON THERAPEUTICS, INC., 10-K, 3/12/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nthat the nature and amount of such Loss is known at such time). The Indemnified Party shall furnish promptly to the indemnifying Party copies of all papers and official documents received in respect of any Losses and Third Party Claims.\n\n11.4 Control of Defense.\n\n11.4.1 In General. Subject to the provisions of Sections 7.4 (if applicable), 7.5 and 7.6, at its option, the indemnifying Party may assume the defense of any Third Party Claim by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within [***] after the indemnifying Party's receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice. The assumption of the defense of a Third Party Claim by the indemnifying Party shall not be construed as an acknowledgment that the indemnifying Party is liable to indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect of the Third Party Claim, nor shall it constitute a waiver by the indemnifying Party of any defenses it may assert against the Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification. Upon assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying Party may appoint as lead counsel in the defense of the Third Party Claim any legal counsel selected by the indemnifying Party which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. In the event the indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver to the indemnifying Party all original notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party in connection with the Third Party Claim. Should the indemnifying Party assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, except as provided in Section 11.4.2, the indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the analysis, defense or settlement of the Third Party Claim unless specifically requested in writing by the indemnifying Party. In the event that it is ultimately determined that the indemnifying Party is not obligated to indemnify, defend or hold harmless the Indemnified Party from and against the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall reimburse the indemnifying Party for any Losses incurred by the indemnifying Party in its defense of the Third Party Claim.\n\n11.4.2 Right to Participate in Defense. Without limiting Section 11.4.1, any Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in, but not control, the defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided that such employment shall be at the Indemnified Party's own expense unless (a) the employment thereof, and the assumption by the indemnifying Party of such expense, has been specifically authorized by the indemnifying Party in writing, (b) the indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel in accordance with Section 11.4.1 (in which case the Indemnified Party shall control the defense), or (c) the interests of the Indemnified Party and the indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim are sufficiently adverse to prohibit the representation by the same counsel of both Parties under Applicable Law, ethical rules or equitable principles (in which case the Indemnifying Party shall control its defense and the Indemnified Party shall control the defense of the Indemnified Party).\n\n11.4.3 Settlement. With respect to any Losses relating solely to the payment of money damages in connection with a Third Party Claim and that shall not result in the Indemnified Party's becoming subject to injunctive or other relief, and as to which the indemnifying Party shall have acknowledged in writing the obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder, the indemnifying Party shall have the sole right to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss, on such terms as the indemnifying Party, in its sole discretion, shall deem appropriate. With respect to all other Losses in connection with Third Party Claims, where the indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 11.4.1, the indemnifying Party shall have authority to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss; provided that it obtains the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the indemnifying Party does not assume and conduct the defense of a Third Party Claim as provided above, the Indemnified Party may defend against such Third Party Claim. Regardless of whether the indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim, no Indemnified Party shall admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or dispose of, any Third Party Claim without\n\n- 60 -\n\nSource: HARPOON THERAPEUTICS, INC., 10-K, 3/12/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nthe prior written consent of the indemnifying Party. The indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement, compromise or other disposition of a Loss by an Indemnified Party that is reached without the written consent of the indemnifying Party.\n\n11.4.4 Cooperation. Regardless of whether the indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause each indemnitee to, cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and shall furnish such records, information and testimony, provide such witnesses and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. Such cooperation shall include access [***] afforded to the indemnifying Party to, and reasonable retention by the Indemnified Party of, records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making Indemnified Parties and other employees and agents available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder, and the indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith, subject to refund if the Indemnifying Party is ultimately held not to be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party.\n\n11.4.5 Expenses. Except as provided above, the reasonable and verifiable costs and expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with any Third Party Claim shall be reimbursed on a [***] basis in arrears by the indemnifying Party, without prejudice to the indemnifying Party's right to contest the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification and subject to refund in the event the indemnifying Party is ultimately held not to be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party.\n\n11.5 Special, Indirect, and Other Losses. EXCEPT (A) FOR FRAUD, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE, (B) FOR A PARTY'S BREACH OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER [ARTICLE 9 OR SECTION 5.8], (C) AS PROVIDED UNDER [***] AND (D) TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH DAMAGES ARE REQUIRED TO BE PAID TO A THIRD PARTY AS PART OF A CLAIM FOR WHICH A PARTY PROVIDES INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THIS ARTICLE 11, NEITHER PARTY NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES SHALL BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE USE OF THE LICENSED COMPOUNDS OR LICENSED PRODUCTS, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n11.6 Insurance.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, AbbVie may self-insure, in whole or in part, the insurance requirements described above.\n\nARTICLE 12 TERM AND TERMINATION\n\n12.1 Term.\n\n12.1.1 Term. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and, unless earlier terminated in accordance herewith, shall continue in force and effect until (a) the date of expiration of the last Royalty Term for the last Licensed Product, or (b) the expiration of the License Option Period and the failure of AbbVie to exercise the License Option (such period, the \"Term\").\n\n12.1.2 Effect of Expiration of the Term.

If, as a result of the application of such dispute resolution procedures, the Breaching Party is determined to be in material breach of one (1) or more of its material obligations under this Agreement (an \"Adverse Ruling\"), then if the Breaching Party fails to complete the actions specified by the Adverse Ruling to cure such material breach within [***] after such ruling, or if such compliance cannot be fully achieved within such [***] period and the Breaching Party has failed to commence diligent efforts to achieve full compliance as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible or as prescribed by the Arbitrator, then the Non-Breaching Party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the Breaching Party.\n\n12.2.2 Material Breach Related to Diligence in a Major Market.
