Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Rights Notice shall be deemed to include sufficient information to make such investment decision if it includes the information specified in items (i) to (iv) of Section 4.1(d). If no Acceptance Notice has been provided to the Company within the required time, HOC will be deemed to have elected not to subscribe for or purchase any such Additional Securities.\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) Following delivery of the Acceptance Notice, if any, the HOC Entities shall pay for, and the Company shall issue to the relevant HOC Entities, free and clear of any liens, the number of Additional Securities specified in the Acceptance Notice and, except as otherwise agreed, the Company shall provide HOC with substantially the same closing documents, including opinions, if applicable, as are delivered to the other persons subscribing for Additional Securities on the closing date for such issuance.\n\n(g) The rights granted to HOC under this Article 4 shall terminate and be of no further force or effect if HOC does not exercise Option and complete the purchase of the Additional Shares.\n\nARTICLE 5 BOARD REPRESENTATION\n\n5.1 Appointment of HOC Nominee.

If HOC acquires the Additional Shares and subsequently acquires additional Shares such that it holds a Pro Rata Interest of 40% or more, HOC shall be entitled to appoint one (1) additional individual to the Board of Directors. For greater clarity, if HOC exercises the Option and holds a Pro Rata Interest of at least 40%, HOC shall be entitled to appoint a total of two (2) individuals to the Board of Directors. Upon receipt of a nomination from HOC for the second director and its satisfaction that the individual meets the qualification requirements for directors under applicable law, the Board of Directors agrees to expand its membership to five positions and appoint the individual nominated by HOC to the newly created vacancy.

or\n\n11\n\n  B) any acquisition (excluding a Tender Offer Transaction), merger, asset purchase and sale, business combination\n\n\n\n\n\n  B) any acquisition (excluding a Tender Offer Transaction), merger, asset purchase and sale, business combination transaction or other extraordinary transaction involving or relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or an intention to make an offer to the Company and/or its subsidiaries to undertake such a transaction, by any person or group of persons (other than any HOC Entities) which would, if completed, result in (I) any class of outstanding equity securities being converted into cash or securities of another person resulting in shareholders holding less than 50% of the equity and/or voting securities of the resulting entity;

If HOC makes a proposal to amend this Agreement to increase the purchase price payable for the Additional Shares, such that the proposal of such other Person shall no longer be a Superior Proposal, and shall complete the purchase of the Additional Shares upon such terms, then neither the Company nor its subsidiaries shall enter into such Alternative Proposal.\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n  (c) The Company shall comply with all securities regulatory filing requirements on a timely basis in connection with the issuance of any Equity Securities of the Company to any HOC Entity, including filing within the periods stipulated under Securities Laws, at the Company's expense, all private placement forms required to be filed by the Company and paying all filing fees required to be paid in connection therewith so that such issuance may lawfully occur without the necessity of filing a prospectus, registration statement or any similar document under the Securities Laws.\n\n  (d) The Company shall, to the extent and for so long as HOC Entities hold at least 14.5% of the Shares on a non-diluted basis, upon HOC's request, permit representatives of the HOC Entities to have access to the site and any of the premises where the business and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries are conducted and access and duplicating rights (and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause persons or firms possessing such documentation or information to give similar access and duplicating rights) to the Company and its Subsidiaries' books of account and records and such other documents, communications, items and matters, within the knowledge, possession or control of the Company, which HOC may reasonably request, at HOC's own cost (other than those it is permitted to examine and make copies of free of charge pursuant to applicable Laws) provided that, except to the extent the information can be provided in the necessary course of business of the Company, acting reasonably including to provide HOC Entities with information to assist the HOC Entities and their advisors with the preparation of the financial statements for such HOC Entities, nothing herein shall require the Company to provide HOC Entities with any information which would constitute a material fact with respect to the Company which has not been generally disclosed.\n\n  (e) In the event the Company shall breach any representation or warranty, covenant or any other right of HOC under this Agreement in any material respect, including but not limited to, the rights afforded to HOC under Articles 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8 hereof, then at the request of HOC, the Company shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-l or S-3 (or, if Form S-l or S-3 is not then available, on such form of registration statement as is then available to effect a registration for resale of the Purchase Shares and the Additional Shares (\"Registration Statement\")), covering the resale of all of the Shares owned by HOC; provided, however, that if prior to the filing of the Registration Statement, the provisions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"1933 Act\") allow the sale of all of the Shares in compliance with that Rule, the Company shall not be obligated to file such Registration Statement so long as the Company at its own expense, does the following: (i) complies with any necessary filing or reporting requirements (under the 1933 Act or otherwise) to permit such sale, (ii) cooperates with HOC in removing any legend on the certificates representing the Shares, including but not limited to instructing its transfer agent to remove such restrictive legend and (iii) provides HOC with an opinion of counsel confirming that such sale is permitted under Rule 144. Such Registration Statement also shall cover, to the extent allowable under the 1933 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder (including Rule 416), such indeterminate number of additional shares of Common Stock resulting from stock splits, stock dividends or similar transactions with respect to the Shares. The Company shall pay all expenses associated with the registration, including filing and printing fees, counsel and accounting fees and expenses, and State \"Blue Sky\" fees and expenses. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC as soon as practicable. The Company shall notify HOC by facsimile or e-mail as promptly as practicable, and in any event, within three (3) business days, after the Registration Statement is declared effective and shall simultaneously provide HOC with copies of any related prospectus to be used in connection with the sale or other disposition of the securities covered thereby.\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n  (f) In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless HOC against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which it may become subject under the 1933 Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any other public filing by the Company, so long as such statement has not been provided to the Company by HOC for inclusion in such registration statement; (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, so long as such omission or alleged omission does not relate to HOC or the manner of sale for the Shares as provided to the Company by HOC; or (iii) any violation of the 1933 Act, any rule or regulation thereunder or any other securities law, rule or regulation applicable to the Company and relating to the action or inaction required of the Company in connection therewith.

The Operator shall at all times retain an operations manager who shall be dedicated to the overall supervision and management of performance of its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n(d) Spare Parts. Operator shall establish and maintain an adequate spare parts inventory, to be located at one or both Sites to serve exclusively the Facilities. 12\n\nSource: BLOOM ENERGY CORP, DRS/A (on S-1), 3/21/2018\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) Programs and Procedures. Prior to the date of the Commencement of Operations for the first Bloom System in the Portfolio, Operator shall have adopted and implemented programs and procedures intended to ensure safe and reliable operation of the Facilities.\n\nThe rights and obligations in this Section 2.2 are without duplication of the rights and obligations of Owner and Operator as Buyer and Seller under, and as defined in, the MESPA.\n\nSection 2.3 Service Fees.\n\n(a) Owner shall compensate Operator for the Facility Services for each Facility, on an annual basis at the rate specified in Exhibit A hereto (the \"Service Fees\"). With respect to each year of such Facility's Warranty Period, the Service Fees shall be invoiced not later than thirty (30) days prior to the end of the calendar month in which the anniversary of the date of Commencement of Operations for such Bloom System occurred, and shall be payable within thirty (30) days of invoice. Interest shall accrue daily on the Service Fees not paid when due, at the lesser of the monthly rate of one and five-tenths percent (1.5%) or the highest rate permissible by law on such unpaid balance. Operator shall be under no obligation to provide or perform services hereunder for any Bloom System whose Service Fee has not been paid in full for the then-current warranty year.\n\n(b) In connection with Facility Services for the BOF, Operator shall provide all required labor but shall charge Owner for, and Owner shall reimburse Operator for, the cost of all required spare parts. Billing for such spare parts shall be done in the same manner as Services Fees, as set forth in Section 2.3(a).\n\nSection 2.4 Facility Services Warranty. During the Warranty Period, Operator shall perform the services to the Bloom Systems and the BOF necessary for the Portfolio to perform to the Warranty Specifications (the \"System Service Warranty\"). In the event that Owner desires Operator to service the Bloom Systems and the BOF beyond the Warranty Period, the rate for such time-based services will be quoted by Operator to Owner quarterly for the following quarter, and materials will be invoiced at the retail prices for such materials.\n\nSection 2.5 Facility Service Warranty Claims.\n\n(a) If Owner desires to make a Facility Service Warranty claim during the Warranty Period, Owner must notify Operator of the defect or other basis for the claim in writing.\n\n(b) In the case of a claim relating to the Power Performance Warranty for a One-Month Power Performance Period or the Efficiency Warranty, upon receipt of such notice and verification by Operator that such One-Month Power Performance Warranty or Efficiency Warranty is applicable, Operator (or its designated subcontractor) or the Service Provider (or its designated subcontractor) will promptly repair or replace, at Operator's sole option and discretion, any Bloom System whose repair or replacement is required in order for the Portfolio to perform consistent with the Power Performance Warranty or the Efficiency Warranty, as applicable. Owner is hereby notified that refurbished parts may be used in repair or replacement, 13\n\nSource: BLOOM ENERGY CORP, DRS/A (on S-1), 3/21/2018\n\n\n\n\n\nbut any such refurbished parts will have passed the same inspections and tests performed by Operator on its new parts of the same type before such refurbished parts are used in any repair. If such repair or replacement is not possible (as determined at Operator's sole option and discretion), Operator will refund the Purchase Price of any such Bloom System to Owner notwithstanding Section 7.1. in which case Operator shall be deemed to have taken title to such Bloom System, and such Bloom System shall be deemed to no longer constitute a portion of the Portfolio. Operator shall make such determination as promptly as practicable, but in any event within 90 days of Operator's receipt of notice of the claim unless the specific nature of the problem requires a longer period in which to make such determination. If it is determined that a Bloom System will be removed pursuant to this Section 2.5. Operator shall at its sole cost and expense remove the Bloom System and any other ancillary equipment (including the concrete pad and any other improvements to the Site to extent required under the Site Lease) from the Site, restoring the Site to its condition before the installation, including closing all utility connections in the manner required by all applicable Legal Requirement and Site Lease.\n\n(c) In the case of a claim relating to the Power Performance Warranty for a One-Year Power Performance Warranty Period, upon receipt of such notice and verification that such One-Year Power Performance Warranty is applicable, Operator shall make a payment to Owner in an amount to be calculated pursuant to Section 2.6; provided that the cumulative aggregate amount of Operator's liability for all claims under this Section 2.5(c) shall not exceed [***] of the aggregate Purchase Price of all Bloom Systems in the Portfolio during the applicable period and the purchase price under the December 30 Bill of Sale (inclusive of any amounts paid or for which a pending claim has been made under the Power Performance Warranty or the Section 8.2(b) Warranty, as applicable, under the MESPA).\n\nSection 2.6 Power Performance Warranty. During the Warranty Period, Operator shall determine (i) for each full calendar month (the \"One- Month Power Performance Warranty Period\") within five (5) Business Days after the end of such month and (ii) for the most recent Look Back Period (the \"One-Year Power Performance Warranty Period\", and, together with the One-Month Power Performance Warranty Period, each a \"Power Performance Warranty Period\"), whether the Bloom Systems in the Portfolio during such Power Performance Warranty Period have delivered to the Interconnection Point the Minimum kWh during such Power Performance Warranty Period (the \"Power Performance Warranty\"). If such Power Performance Warranty calculation indicates that the Actual kWh of the Bloom Systems was less than the Minimum kWh during such Power Performance Warranty Period, then Operator shall so notify Owner in writing of the basis of its determination and Owner may make a claim under Section 2.5. An example of a Power Performance Warranty calculation for purposes of a Section 2.5 claim is attached as Appendix D.\n\nSection 2.7 Efficiency Warranty. During the Warranty Period, Operator shall determine for each full calendar month (the \"Efficiency Warranty Period\") within five (5) Business Days after the end of such month whether the Portfolio has performed at the Minimum Efficiency Level (the \"Efficiency Warranty\"); provided that the Efficiency Bank shall be utilized to the extent necessary to meet the Efficiency Warranty. If the Minimum Efficiency Level has [***] Confidential Treatment Requested 14\n\nSource: BLOOM ENERGY CORP, DRS/A (on S-1), 3/21/2018\n\n\n\n\n\nnot been met during such Efficiency Warranty Period, then Operator shall so notify Owner in writing of the basis of its determination and Owner may make a claim under Section 2.5. An example of an Efficiency Warranty calculation for purposes of a Section 2.5 claim is attached as Appendix E.\n\nSection 2.8 Gas Payment Shortfall. During the Warranty Period, Operator shall perform such services on the Bloom Systems as shall cause the Efficiency Bank to maintain a positive balance at all times. If the Efficiency Bank reaches a balance of less than zero during the Warranty Period, Operator shall reimburse Owner for any Gas Payment Shortfall that Owner incurs within ten (10) days after Owner provides notice to Operator of such shortfall amount; provided that Operator's cumulative aggregate liability under this Section 2.8 plus any payments required to be made by Operator under Section 2.5(c) shall not exceed an amount equal to (i) one hundred percent (100%) of the aggregate Purchase Price of all Bloom Systems in the Portfolio during the applicable period and the purchase price under the December 30 Bill of Sale (inclusive of any amounts paid or for which a pending claim has been made for under the Gas Payment Shortfall under the MESPA), less (ii) the aggregate of all amounts paid by Operator (or claimed against Operator in the case of any claims that are pending at the time of such calculation) with respect to claims under Section 2.5(c) hereunder or Sections 8.2(b) and 8.3(c) of the MESPA. An example of a Gas Payment Shortfall calculation for purposes of a Section 2.8 claim is attached as Appendix F.\n\nSection 2.9 Exclusions.

License of Good Sam Name and Logo.\n\n               A.

AGI warrants that it has the right and ability to grant the License to the Company to use the Trademarks for the Approved Use in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and, provided that the Company uses the Trademarks for the Approved Use in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such grant will not infringe upon the rights of any other party. If the Company promptly notifies AGI in writing of a third party claim against the Company alleging that the Company's use of the Trademarks infringes a United States registered trademark, and if such claim of infringement is not caused in whole or in part by the Company having used the Trademarks other than for the Approved Use or other than strictly in the manner approved by AGI in accordance with the terms of this\n\n                                      -1-\n\nAgreement, AGI will defend such claim at its expense and will indemnify the Company, its agents and representatives, for all losses, claims, charges, costs and expenses incurred by the Company as a result of such claim.

In order to protect the good will of AGI and the Good Sam club, AGI retains the right to review and approve in advance and in its sole discretion, all uses of the Trademarks and the Good Sam name and logo. Therefore, the Company shall give AGI at least ten business days prior written notice and description of intended use by the Company of the Trademark and the Good Sam name and logo, and the Company's use of the Trademarks and the Good Sam name and logo is subject to approval of AGI.\n\n               C. The Company agrees that its use of the Trademarks and the Good Sam name and logo is restricted to the Approved Use, and the Company shall not use the Trademarks or the Good Sam name or logo for any other purpose.

The terms of the marketing program will be set forth in a marketing agreement between AGI and the Company. The marketing agreement will provide, among other things, the terms pursuant to which the Company shall make \"Fulfillment Deposits\" for warranty products sold as a part of the marketing program.\n\n        6. Relationship.

If, in Carrier's reasonable judgment, an increase in Shipper's Dedicated Rates of more than ten percent (10%) would be required to place Carrier in substantially the same economic position as it was in prior to the imposition or assessment of such fees, charges or costs, Carrier may call for a meeting among the Parties' senior management to take place within thirty (30) Days of written notice to Shipper, and the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to amend the provisions of this Agreement such that the Parties are in substantially the same relative economic position as they were in prior to the imposition or assessment of such fees, charges or costs. If the Parties are unable to agree on an economic adjustment within sixty (60) Days of the senior management meeting, then Carrier may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement without penalty by delivering Shipper written notice of Carrier's intent to terminate. Such termination shall be effective, at the option of Shipper, (i) as of 9:00 a.m. on the first Day of the Month which follows the Month that Carrier delivered its notice of intent to terminate, or (ii) as of 9:00 a.m. on the first Day of the Month which is twelve (12) Months after such date, provided that Shipper's Dedicated Rates for such twelve (12) Month period before such termination shall be increased to place Carrier in substantially the same economic position as it was in prior to the imposition or assessment of such fees, charges, or costs. Shipper shall exercise such option by delivery of written notice to Carrier of Shipper's election within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of Carrier's notice to terminate, provided that if Shipper has not responded to Carrier by the time described in clause (i) above, the Agreement shall continue pursuant to clause (ii) above.\n\nShipper shall be entitled to audit Carrier's applicable books and records for the limited purpose of determining if the amount of any increase pursuant to this Section 6.2 is justified by the actually-incurred and reasonable amount of the aggregate costs and/or expenses relating to the System; provided, however, such audit shall not require Carrier to disclose confidential information of any Person other than Shipper who is a shipper on the System. If such audit shall reflect that such increase was not justifiable in accordance with the foregoing, Carrier shall promptly credit the amount of such discrepancy to Shipper, unless Carrier disagrees with the results of such audit, in which case the matter shall be resolved pursuant to the dispute resolution provisions set forth in Article XII hereof.\n\n6.3 Governmental Modifications. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge that the Tariff rates payable for all Services are subject to the approval of and modification by the FERC or any other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction.   7\n\nSource: RANGE RESOURCES - LOUISIANA, INC., 8-K, 4/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE VII DEDICATION & FACILITIES\n\n7.1 Dedication.

Carrier shall design, engineer, modify, construct and equip, or caused to be designed, engineered, modified, constructed and equipped, Carrier's System, including, without limitation, the facilities and equipment described on Exhibit B attached hereto (the facilities and equipment described on Exhibit B being collectively referred to as the \"Commencement Date Facilities\").\n\n7.3 Post-Commencement Date Facilities.\n\n(a) After the Commencement Date, in connection with the construction of the Mount Olive Plant, Carrier will construct 13 miles of 8\" pipeline between the Mount Olive Plant and the Lincoln Parish Plant, and a Receipt Point at the Mount Olive Plant.\n\n(b) If after the Commencement Date, Shipper requires an addition, modification, alteration, replacement, or expansion of the System, other than as noted in Section 7.3(a) above (a \"New Facility\"), Shipper will provide Carrier a written notification of such requested New Facility containing sufficient information for Carrier to estimate the cost to provide such New Facility.

It is understood and agreed that the settlement of strikes or lockouts shall be entirely within the discretion of the Party having the difficulty, and that the above requirement that any Force Majeure shall be remedied with all reasonable dispatch shall not require the settlement of strikes or lockouts by acceding to the demands of the opposing party when such course is inadvisable in the discretion of the Party having the difficulty.\n\n11.2 Definition of Force Majeure. The term \"Force Majeure\" as used herein shall mean acts of God; strikes, lockouts, or other industrial disturbances; conditions arising from a change in governmental laws, orders, rules, or regulations; acts of public enemy; wars; blockades; insurrections; riots; epidemics; landslides; lightning; earthquakes; fires; storms; floods; washouts; arrests and restraints of governments and people; civil disturbances; explosions; breakage or accident to machinery or lines of pipe; the necessity for making repairs, tests, alterations, or performing maintenance to machinery or lines of pipe; scheduled maintenance; freezing of wells or lines of pipe; partial or entire failure of wells, processing, or gasification and gas manufacturing facilities; orders or directives of, or proceedings initiated by, any Governmental Authority; and any other causes, whether of the kind herein enumerated or otherwise, not within the control of the Party claiming relief hereunder, and which by the exercise of due diligence, such Party is unable to prevent or overcome.

Shipper's termination right under this Section 11.3 shall be subject to its compliance with Section 14.2 in connection with any certificates, approvals, authorizations and permits required by Carrier as a result of the event of Carrier Force Majeure.\n\nARTICLE XII DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n12.1 Resolution of Disputes.

While the procedures in this ARTICLE XII are pending, each Party shall continue to perform its existing obligations under the Agreement to the extent those obligations are not the subject of the Dispute.\n\n12.2 Dispute Notice. Prior to submitting any Dispute for resolution by a court, a Party shall provide written notice (a \"Dispute Notice\") to the other of the occurrence of such dispute. The Dispute Notice shall contain (i) a concise statement describing the Dispute, including a description of its nature, circumstances and cause, (ii) an explanation of the basis and justification for the Dispute, including reference to any pertinent provision(s) of the Agreement, (iii) if applicable, the estimated dollar amount of the Dispute and how that estimate was determined, (iv) the claiming Party's desired resolution, and (v) any other information the claiming Party deems relevant.\n\n12.3 Direct Negotiation.

If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute for any reason within such fifteen (15) Business Day period, then either Party shall be entitled to pursue any remedies available at law or in equity; provided, however, this Section 12.3 shall not limit a Party's right to initiate litigation prior to the expiration of the time periods set forth in this Section 12.3 if application of such limitations would prevent a Party from filing a lawsuit or claim within the applicable period for filing lawsuits (e.g. statutes of limitation, prescription, etc.).\n\n12.4 Jurisdiction and Venue.

If Shipper has failed to pay any amount when due under this Agreement and if such non-payment is not being disputed in good faith by Shipper, Carrier shall have the right to request and receive from Shipper adequate assurance of performance (\"Financial Assurance\") which shall mean credit support in a form reasonably acceptable to Carrier and in an amount and for the term reasonably acceptable to Carrier. Any of the following shall be an acceptable form of credit support:\n\n  (a) An irrevocable standby letter of credit from a bank satisfactory to Carrier;   14\n\nSource: RANGE RESOURCES - LOUISIANA, INC., 8-K, 4/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n  (b) Provide a prepayment or a deposit in advance of the Month in which Services hereunder are to be provided; or\n\n  (c) A performance bond issued by a Person satisfactory to Carrier.\n\nIf the credit of Shipper's guarantor is satisfactory in Carrier's opinion, a demand for Financial Assurance can be satisfied with a guarantee issued on behalf of Shipper in a form acceptable to Carrier, but only for as long as the credit of Shipper's guarantor continues to be acceptable to Carrier. Carrier acknowledges and agrees that Memorial Resource Development Corp. is a satisfactory guarantor.\n\nShould Shipper or its guarantor fail to provide Financial Assurance within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of written demand for such assurance, then Carrier shall have the right to suspend performance under this Agreement until such time as Shipper furnishes Financial Assurance. For the avoidance of doubt, such suspension of performance by Carrier shall not relieve Shipper of its obligation to make payments of amounts due hereunder, including, without limitation, payment of fees due hereunder.\n\nIf during the Term, Carrier has failed to pay any amount when due under this Agreement and if such non-payment is not being disputed in good faith by Carrier, Shipper shall have the right to request and receive from Carrier adequate Financial Assurance under similar terms and conditions as described above, including the right to suspend performance under this Agreement until such time as Carrier furnishes Financial Assurance.\n\nARTICLE XIV DUTY TO SUPPORT\n\n14.1 Arm's Length Negotiations. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement is the result of good faith, arm's length negotiations which have resulted in an agreement that is fair and equitable to Carrier and Shipper.\n\n14.2 Shipper Support.

Each of the Parties further acknowledges that the setting of Tariff rates for the System is subject to the approval of, and potential modification by, the FERC, from time to time, and each of the Parties hereby agrees not to, directly or indirectly, commence or support any application, motion or other proceeding (a \"Tariff Rate Revision Proceeding\") before the FERC for the purpose of requesting the FERC to set tariff rates applicable to the System which are inconsistent with this Agreement.\n\n14.4 Third Party Proceedings. In the event of any Tariff Rate Revision Proceeding being commenced by a third party or by the FERC itself, and in the event of any other proceedings pursuant to which the Tariff rates for the System may be reviewed by the FERC or other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction, Shipper agrees to not object to the setting of Tariff rates applicable to the System that are consistent with this Agreement. In the event of any other proceedings challenging any of the terms of this Agreement being commenced by a third party or by the FERC itself, Shipper agrees to provide all reasonable support and cooperation in defending such terms or otherwise resolving the complaint or other challenge as shall be reasonably requested by Carrier.\n\nARTICLE XV  COMMON CARRIER AND COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS\n\n15.1 Common Carrier Pipeline. The System will be operated as a common carrier pipeline, and Shipper's rights hereunder shall be subject to all laws related to and governing the operation of common carrier pipelines, including, without limitation, laws and regulations that prevent discrimination in favor of any given shipper or the provision of service for consideration other than the rate set forth in a published tariff. The Tariff shall apply to the Services provided hereunder, and if there is a conflict between a provision of this Agreement and the Tariff, the Tariff shall apply. Carrier reserves the right to modify or amend the Tariff, in its sole discretion, as it deems necessary; provided, however, any such modification or amendment shall be consistent with this Agreement.\n\n15.2 Compliance with Laws.

In the case of transfers under clause (iv) above, the transferor shall be released from its obligations and liabilities under this Agreement to the extent of the obligations assumed by the transferee, provided that Shipper's and such transferee's combined obligations to Carrier shall be no greater than Shipper's obligations to Carrier prior to such transfer.\n\n16.3 Collateral Assignments. Either Party may grant a lien or security interest in this Agreement to any Person as security in connection with arranging financing for such Party or any Affiliate of such Party (and each Party agrees to execute all consents, estoppels, waivers and other documents and instruments reasonable requested by any such Person).\n\nARTICLE XVII TAXES\n\nShipper shall pay, or cause to be paid, all production, severance, gross receipts, ad valorem, and similar Taxes, and all surcharges, levied or imposed on it by any Governmental Authority with respect to Shipper Product. In the event Carrier is required to pay or remit any such Tax or surcharge owed by Shipper, Shipper shall reimburse Carrier for such Tax or surcharge pursuant to Carrier's invoice for the same.

Unless Shipper and Carrier have agreed otherwise in a TSA, Carrier reserves the right to control in its discretion the component distribution in the Product tendered by Shipper or its designee, in order to achieve maximum operating efficiency of Carrier's facilities and optimum utilization of total transportation capacity. Carrier shall use reasonable judgment in exercising that discretion.\n\n\n\nD. The rate at which Product is delivered to Carrier and redelivered from Carrier will be determined by Carrier's transportation and redelivery obligations to its shippers and by the necessity of economical use and efficient operation of Carrier's facilities, which shall be determined by Carrier in the exercise of its reasonable judgment. Carrier will assume no liability for its inability to maintain schedules or comply with Shipper's redelivery requests when caused by operational or scheduling problems, excess demand, delays and other problems encountered in pipeline operations.\n\n  6. NOMINATIONS IN EXCESS OF CAPACITY:\n\nWhen there is offered to Carrier quantities of Product greater than can be transported on the System, Carrier shall allocate the available transportation capacity on the System (\"Available Capacity\"). Allocation will be given as a daily or monthly volume, at Carrier's discretion, and will be calculated for the calendar month.\n\nNew Shippers will have access to a minimum of ten percent (10%) of the Available Capacity and Historical Shippers will have access to a maximum of ninety percent (90%) of the Available Capacity.\n\nCarrier shall allocate up to ninety percent (90%) of the Available Capacity on a non-discriminatory historical basis to all Historical Shippers. Each individual Historical Shipper's entitlement will be based on (i) the average monthly volumes of the Historical Shipper's Representative Period, based on the greater of the volumes transported or paid for during each month of the Representative Period or (ii) for an Incentive Shipper, based on the Incentive Shipper's Committed Volume on a yearly basis.\n\nThe remaining ten percent (10%) of the Available Capacity shall be allocated on a prorata basis to New Shippers. Carrier is not required to allocate more than two percent (2%) of the Available Capacity to any individual New Shipper.\n\nThe Carrier will repeat this allocation process until all of the Available Capacity has been allocated.\n\nAllocation will not be transferred. With agreement of the Shippers concerned, historical volume will be transferred under the following conditions:\n\n  \u2022   No commercial transaction occurs between the participating shippers with regard to historical volumes.\n\n  \u2022   The transfer is irrevocable.\n\n  \u2022   The request to transfer must be the result of an unusual situation as may be reasonably determined by Carrier.   8\n\nSource: RANGE RESOURCES - LOUISIANA, INC., 8-K, 4/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n\nFERC ICA OIL TARIFF F.E.R.C.

Shipper or Consignee may be present or represented at the gauging and testing. Quantities shall be determined in accordance with applicable A.P.I. Manual of Petroleum Measurement Standards and applicable Gas Processors Association procedures.\n\n\n\nB. Any overage or shortage not due to the negligence of Carrier, including losses resulting from shrinkage, evaporation, other physical Product loss and interface mixture in any calendar month, will be allocated on a monthly accrual basis among Shippers in the proportion that the total number of Barrels delivered from the entire System for each Shipper bears to the total number of Barrels delivered from the entire System for all Shippers.\n\n\n\nC. Carrier may require Shipper to furnish a certificate setting forth in detail the specification of each shipment of Product offered for transportation hereunder, and Shipper shall be liable for any contamination or damage to other Product in Carrier's custody or to the System or other Carrier facilities caused by failure of the Product Tendered to meet the specifications stated in Shipper's certification. Carrier may, but shall not be required to, sample and/or test any shipment prior to acceptance or during receipt of shipment, and, in the event of variance between the specifications contained in said certificate and the specifications indicated by Carrier's test, Carrier's test result shall prevail and be used to determine whether the shipment meets Carrier's specifications. Shipper or Consignee may be present or represented at such measuring and testing.\n\n  D. A representative of Carrier shall have the right to enter upon the premises where Shipper's Product is received or delivered and have access to any and all storage receptacles or meters for the purposes of measuring and testing and to make any examination, inspection, measurement or test required.\n\n  E.

Carrier will not accept Product for transportation unless such facilities have been provided and conform to the operating requirements of Carrier in Carrier's sole discretion. Unless otherwise agreed in a TSA between Carrier and Shipper, the cost of such facilities shall be provided at the sole cost of Shipper seeking access to the System.\n\n  12. NOTICE OF ARRIVAL, DELIVERY AT DESTINATION:\n\nAfter a shipment has had time to arrive at destination, Carrier may begin delivery of such shipment from its common stock to Shipper or Consignee at Carrier's current rate of pumping. Shipper shall timely remove Product, or cause Product to be removed, from the System following transportation to a Nominated Delivery Point. If Shipper or Consignee is unable or refuses to receive said shipment, a demurrage charge of one dollar ($1.00) per Barrel per twenty-four (24) hours shall accrue from the time said notice expires on that part of such shipment which is not received by Shipper or Consignee. In addition to such demurrage charge, Carrier shall have the right to make such disposition of unremoved Product as is necessary for the efficient operation of the System, and Shipper shall pay Carrier all charges associated with such disposition the same as if Shipper had authorized such, together with any associated additional costs and damages borne or incurred by Carrier. Shipper shall indemnify Carrier for all losses associated with unremoved Product and Carrier's disposition of unremoved Product. Carrier shall have no liability to Shipper associated with Shipper's unremoved Product or Carrier's disposition of unremoved Product.\n\n  13. TITLE:\n\nCarrier may require of Shipper satisfactory evidence of its perfected and unencumbered title of any Product Tendered for shipment on the System. Carrier shall have the right to reject any Product, when Tendered for transportation, that may be involved in litigation, the title of which may be in dispute, or which may be encumbered by a lien or charge of any kind (other than the lien created hereunder in favor of Carrier and any liens permitted under a TSA between Carrier and Shipper).\n\nAt the time of Nomination, Shipper shall inform Carrier if any Product Nominated and/or to be Tendered to Carrier for transportation (i) may be involved in litigation, (ii) may be subject to a title dispute, or (iii) may be encumbered by a lien or charge of any kind (other than the lien created hereunder in favor of Carrier and any liens permitted under a TSA between   10\n\nSource: RANGE RESOURCES - LOUISIANA, INC., 8-K, 4/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n\nFERC ICA OIL TARIFF F.E.R.C.

Shipper agrees to hold Carrier harmless for any and all loss, cost, liability, damage and/or expense resulting from failure of title thereto; provided that acceptance for transportation shall not be deemed a representation by Carrier as to title.\n\n  14. RATES APPLICABLE:\n\nProduct accepted for transportation shall be subject to the rates in effect on the date of receipt by Carrier, irrespective of the date of the Nomination.\n\n  15. RATES APPLICABLE FROM INTERMEDIATE POINTS:\n\nFor shipments accepted for transportation from any point not named in this Tariff making reference hereto which is intermediate to a point from which rates are published in said tariffs, through such unnamed point, the rate published therein from the next more distant Receipt Point specified in the tariff will apply from such unnamed point. For shipments accepted for transportation to any point not named in tariffs making reference hereto which is intermediate to a point to which rates are published in said tariffs, through such unnamed point, the rate published therein to the next more distant Delivery Point specified in the tariff will apply. Continuous use of intermediate point rate application for more than thirty (30) days requires establishment of a rate for the transportation service.\n\n  16.

At any time, upon the request of Carrier, Shipper shall, within ten (10) days of such request, provide information to Carrier that will allow Carrier to determine Shipper's capacity to perform any financial obligations that could arise from the transportation of that Shipper's Product under the terms of this Tariff, including the payment of transportation charges, equalization obligations, the value of any loss allowance, and any negative Shipper balance positions. Carrier shall not be obligated to accept Product for transportation from any Shipper or prospective shipper if such Shipper or prospective shipper fails to provide the requested information to Carrier within the time periods set forth herein, or if Carrier's review of the requested information reveals that such Shipper or prospective shipper does not have the capacity to perform any financial obligations that could arise from the transportation of its Product under the terms of this Tariff, including the payment of transportation charges, equalization obligations, the reasonably determined value of any loss allowance, and any negative balance positions.\n\n  F. Subject to the provisions of Item No. 16(G), Carrier upon notice to Shipper or prospective shipper, may require one or more of the following financial assurances for the payment of all charges and costs as provided for in this Tariff, or otherwise lawfully due to Carrier to be provided at the expense of such Shipper or prospective shipper:\n\n\n\ni. payment security by wire transfer in an amount equal to two and a half months of transportation charges based on Shipper's or prospective shipper's likely actual shipments for the production month for each applicable line segment.

Within ten (10) business days of such a determination by Carrier, the Financial Assurance provided in accordance with Item No. 16(F)(i) shall be returned to such Shipper or prospective shipper.\n\n\n\nI. Carrier shall have a self-executing lien on all Products delivered to Carrier to secure the payment of any and all charges that are owed to Carrier. Such lien shall survive delivery of Products to Shipper. Such lien shall extend to all Products in Carrier's possession beginning with Shipper's first receipt of transportation or other services from Carrier. The lien provided herein shall be in addition to any lien or security interest provided by this Tariff, statute or applicable law. Carrier may withhold delivery to Shipper of any of Shipper's Products in its possession and exercise any other rights and remedies granted under the applicable tariffs or existing under applicable law until all such charges have been paid as provided above.\n\n\n\nJ. If Shipper fails to pay an invoice by the due date, Carrier will notify Shipper of the failure, and if Shipper has not remedied the failure within thirty (30) days following receipt of notice from Carrier, in addition to any other remedies under this Tariff or under applicable law, Carrier shall have the right, either directly or through an agent, to sell any Products of such Shipper in Carrier's custody at public auction, on any day not a legal holiday, not less than forty-eight (48) hours after publication of notice of such sale in a daily newspaper of general circulation published in the town, city, or general area where the sale is to be held, stating the time and place of sale and the quantity and location of the Products to be sold. At said sale, Carrier shall have the right to bid, and, if it is the highest bidder, to become the purchaser. The proceeds of any sale shall be applied in the following order: (1) To the reasonable expenses of holding, preparing for sale, selling, and to the extent allowed by law, reasonable attorney's fees and legal expenses incurred by Carrier; and (2) To the satisfaction of Shipper's indebtedness including interest herein provided from the date payment is due.

PURCHASE ORDERS AND STOCK ON HAND\n\n1. Issuance and Acceptance of Purchase Order. To order the Xplore Products, Distributor shall place a purchase order via sending an email to xpldistributors@zebra.com. Each purchase order shall specify the bill-to address, ship-to address, quantity and description of each Xplore Product ordered, the unit price for each Xplore Product, the requested ship date, the preferred means of delivery, and tax-exempt certifications, if any. Orders received without this information or which contain any discrepancy may be returned to Distributor for completion or revision as applicable. Each purchase order placed by Distributor, as well as each invoice sent by Xplore, shall be governed by the terms of this Addendum and the Distribution Agreement and any additional or different terms within the purchase order or invoice shall have no effect. Each purchase order for the Xplore Products shall be subject to Xplore's acceptance and, upon acceptance, Xplore shall confirm the purchase order and the Estimated Shipping Date with Distributor. Notwithstanding such acceptance, Xplore reserves the right where necessary to amend the Orders including without limitation part numbers, special pricing and Estimated Shipping Date, and may at its sole discretion require an amended Order from Distributor incorporating such changes. For the purposes of this Exhibit B, \"Estimated Shipping Date\" shall mean the estimated shipping date of an accepted purchase order.\n\n2. Purchase Order Rescheduling, Cancellation and Modification. Distributor has the right to cancel, reschedule or modify all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such cancellation or modification request is made within [*****] business days of PO acceptance or rescheduling request is made at least [*****] business days prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order. Distributor has the right to change the destination of all or any portion of a purchase order that has been accepted by Xplore at no cost to Distributor only if such change in destination request is made at least [*****] business days prior to the most current Estimated Shipping Date for that purchase order. Except as set forth above, purchase orders are non-changeable and non- cancellable by Distributor, once accepted by Xplore.\n\nCertain purchase orders, determined at Xplore's sole discretion, and generally of large volume and/or extended lead times, may be subject to alternative rescheduling, cancellation, and modification rights. Should such purchase orders be subject to alternative rights, Xplore shall inform Distributor of alternative rights prior to order acceptance. Distributor will then have [*****] business days to accept, or reject, the alternative terms of Xplore for that certain purchase order. If Distributor rejects such alternative terms, the purchase order will not be accepted by Xplore.\n\n3. Product Allocation. If for any reason, Xplore's production is not on schedule, Xplore may, at its sole and absolute discretion, allocate available inventory to Distributor and make shipments in accordance with Zebra's then current processes.\n\nSource: SCANSOURCE, INC., 10-Q, 5/9/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n4.

If inventory levels fall below the thirty (30) day goal for more than sixty (60) consecutive days, Xplore, upon written notice to Distributor, shall replenish the stock to an amount agreed by both Parties.\n\n5. Product Return and Stock Rotation. The terms of Section 3 of Schedule 2 of the Distribution Agreement will apply to Xplore Products, provided however that stock rotation allowance for Xplore Products will be based on the net dollar value of Distributor's purchases in each calendar quarter of Xplore Products and such allowance will be calculated separate and apart from all other Products purchased by Distributor during such period.\n\nARTICLE II.

Such prices are exclusive of all federal, state, municipal or other government excise, sales, use, occupational or like taxes in force, and any such taxes shall be assumed and paid for by Distributor in addition to its payment for the Xplore Products. Title and risk of loss to Xplore Products shall pass to Distributor upon delivery to Distributor, as indicated in the Proof of Delivery (PoD) documents. [*****]\n\n1. At Distributor's request, Xplore may deliver Xplore Products directly to Program Members or their respective End Users on behalf of Distributor, and in such instances title and risk of loss will pass to Distributor upon delivery to the applicable recipients, as indicated on the PoD documents.

The undersigned represent and warrant that they are authorized as representatives of the party on whose behalf they are signing this Agreement and that they have read and agree to adhere to the Terms and Conditions as well as the exhibits attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the Effective Date. Channel Partner: iPass Inc.: By: /s/ Victor A. Bozzo By: /s/ Christine Gardner Victor A. Bozzo Christine Gardner Printed Name Printed Name Chief Executive Officer VP Finance Title Title 4/24/2018 04/25/2018 Date Date\n\nSource: IPASS INC, 8-K, 12/3/2018\n\n\n\n\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS 1. APPOINTMENT OF CHANNEL PARTNER 1.1 General. iPass will make the Service available to Channel Partner in exchange for the fees referenced in the Exhibits attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. Channel Partner may order Services using an iPass approved order form available via the iPass Portal. Each order form must reference this Agreement and each order form shall merge and incorporate the terms herein. Each order form is a separate and distinct contractual obligation. 1.2 Grant of Authority. iPass grants to Channel Partner a nonexclusive, terminable right to: (i) access and otherwise use the Licensed Software, and iPass Marks as provided in Exhibit F solely in furtherance of this Agreement and not for other internal business purposes, (ii) sell or re-license the Licensed Software, Documentation and Services to Business Entities and End Users, and (iii) install and execute the Server Software on up to three (3) designated servers and one backup server for Channel Partner and for each End User. Channel Partner accepts iPass as the exclusive provider to Channel Partner for all services of the nature of the Services. In no event may Channel Partner resell or otherwise provide the Service to any third party for purposes of further \"down channel\" resale of the Services, absent iPass' notice and consent. The license granted under this Section 1.2 does not include a license or other right to use the iPass domain name and does not include the right to use the trademark or trade name of any iPass supplier or partner. 1.3 Software Delivery iPass will provide the Licensed Software to Channel Partner electronically via the iPass Portal, an iPass FTP website or on-line app store. 1.4 Account and Password Information. iPass will assign to Channel Partner a unique password and identification code used to access the Channel Partner section of the iPass Portal. Channel Partner may not transfer or share this account information with any third party. Channel Partner is solely responsible for assigning user names and passwords (\"Credentials\") to End Users so that End Users may access the iPass Portal and for imposing reasonable limitations on the disclosure of such Credentials. 2. CHANNEL PARTNER RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1 General. Channel Partner will use its reasonable endeavours cooperate with iPass and assist with the implementation of this Agreement and performance of the Services. Prior to deployment of the Licensed Software in a production environment, Channel Partner agrees to implement processes that will allow the Licensed Software to successfully report as specified in the Documentation. If Channel Partner fails to implement such processes within a reasonable time following iPass' request, iPass may elect to terminate the Agreement or Channel Partner's use of the Licensed Software upon written notice to Channel Partner. In such an event, Channel Partner shall be responsible for payment of all undisputed amounts due and owing to iPass under the Agreement. In addition, Channel Partner agrees to ensure that prior to deployment of the Licensed Software in a Business Entity production environment, each Business Entity implements processes that will allow the Licensed Software to successfully report as specified in the Documentation. If Channel Partner's Business Entity fails to implement such processes within a reasonable time following iPass' or Channel Partner's request, iPass may elect to terminate the order for such Business Entity upon written notice to Channel Partner. In such an event, Channel Partner shall be responsible for payment of all undisputed amounts due and owing to iPass under the Agreement. 2.2 Acceptable Use Policy. Channel Partner agrees that it will not (and will not permit Business Entities) to use the Service in a manner contrary to the iPass acceptable use policy located at http://www3.ipass.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Acceptable-Use-Policy.pdf/ ,  and incorporated herein by reference.\n\nPage 2 of 22 iPass Channel Partner Reseller Agreement 04.18.2018 iPass Confidential\n\n[***] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b- 2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nSource: IPASS INC, 8-K, 12/3/2018\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 End User Realms. A realm is used to uniquely identify a user with a specific End User or group. (An example would be example.com). Realms are created by iPass in cooperation with Channel Partner and the relevant End User. Channel Partner does not own or control these realms by virtue of having registered them with iPass or having paid any fees associated with such registration. Upon request by Channel Partner or the End User, iPass may remove a realm from its system or re-assign a realm to another Channel Partner. 2.4 End User Support. Channel Partner will provide technical and End User support in accordance with Exhibit D. 2.5 End User Satisfaction. iPass may, upon reasonable notice to Channel Partner, directly contact End Users for any reason pertaining to such End User's use of the Service, subject to compliance with local privacy law. Should an End User communicate to Channel Partner or to iPass its dissatisfaction regarding the Services or related matters, the notified party shall promptly give notice to the other party, and iPass and Channel Partner shall work together in good faith to resolve the issue to End User's reasonable satisfaction. If in iPass' reasonable determination the issue is not resolved within thirty (30) days after Channel Partner's receipt of notice of End User's dissatisfaction, iPass may, in addition to other remedies available to iPass, revoke Channel Partner's appointment under Section 1.2 wholly or with respect to such End User and may refer such End User to another iPass channel partner or provide services directly to such End User without any liability to Channel Partner. 2.6 End User Agreements. Before making available any Services to an End User, Channel Partner will enter into an End User Agreement that is materially similar to the terms and conditions contained in Exhibit E. Channel Partner will enforce each End User Agreement with at least the same degree of diligence used in enforcing similar agreements pertaining Channel Partner's own services or products but in no event will Channel Partner provide a standard of care in this regard that is less than commercially reasonable. Channel Partner will not waive, amend, or agree to terms that would tend to negate or materially dilute the sample terms provided in Exhibit E.

This architecture gives an End User choice in access services and serves as a bridge to future functionality through use of extensible web services standards, while keeping the operational and financial burden on carriers low by not requiring them to purchase, deploy and manage on-premises infrastructure. iPass\u00b4 Platform is designed to provide Customer with reliability, flexibility, network security, policy enforcement, consolidated billing and scalability. The technology consists of the following principal components: i. Foundation Services. Provide the basic capabilities needed for a cloud-based platform, including the ability to manage users (add, remove, or change rights), authenticate users to access the platform, authorize access to particular functions, or track and audit use of the platform. ii. Operational Services. Are built on top of the iPass Foundation Services platform, enabling Customer to operate the various iPass\u00b4 market- facing offers, including user profile/configuration management, network directory management, account management, order management, usage management, support, billing and training. iii. Presentation Services. Impact how information is presented to users of the Platform, usually through a web based portal. Presentation Services include web presentation, data validation, access control (controlling who can see and enter what), and web analytics. iv. Client Services. Provide the core update functionality within the Platform, with the ability to update the iPass Client Software, configuration files, and network registries associated with it, and to receive the data that the client collects. v. Curation Services. Ability of iPass platform to collect information about Open Networks and be able to decode the hotspot information and automate steps to connect to that Network. vi. High-Availability and Scalable Authentication Architecture. iPass\u00b4 relationships with network service providers enables iPass to provide connectivity through multiple networks in over 100 countries on the Platform. As a result, the cloud-based Platform reduces the risk of service interruptions associated with depending on only one service provider. Furthermore, iPass\u00b4 geographically distributed transaction centers act as a unified and fault-tolerant system that provides scalable and highly-available user authentication and quality management information collection. Each point in the authentication process is designed with built-in redundancy and fail-over capabilities.\n\nPage 13 of 22 iPass Channel Partner Reseller Agreement 04.18.2018 iPass Confidential\n\n[***] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b- 2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nSource: IPASS INC, 8-K, 12/3/2018\n\n\n\n\n\nEXHIBIT C SERVICE FEES 1.

Changes shall be subject to acceptance testing by CHT prior to being deployed into production in accordance with procedures described in Section 3(d) or as otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. Ehave shall not refuse to accept a CHT Change request unless it is unable to make the Change requested using commercially reasonable efforts, in which event Ehave will provide an explanation to CHT; or Ehave and CHT fail to agree on the terms and conditions related to the performance of such Change, including the costs, if any. If a mutually acceptable resolution is not reached in respect of a CHT Change request, the Parties may submit the issue to mediation pursuant to Section 19(b). (d) Acceptance The criteria (\"Acceptance Criteria\") which the Ehave Companion Solution is to meet and the procedures by which such criteria are to be tested (\"Acceptance Procedures\") shall be set out in the Implementation Plan and shall follow the requirements set out in this Section 3(d). Once notified by Ehave that the Ehave Companion Solution is ready for acceptance testing, CHT shall perform the tests as set out in the Acceptance Procedures. Unless otherwise set out in the Acceptance Procedures, CHT shall have ten (10) Business Days to perform the acceptance tests as set out in the Acceptance Procedures and to provide Ehave written notice of acceptance or non-acceptance of the Ehave Companion Solution (the \"Acceptance Period\").

ESCROW (a) Escrow Agreement (i) Concurrently with execution of this Agreement or, at CHT's option, as soon as practicable after the Effective Date but in no event later than CHT's acceptance of and the launch of the Ehave Companion Solution, CHT and Ehave shall enter into a Source Code Escrow Agreement with a reputable software escrow agent mutually acceptable to the Parties (\"Escrow Agent\"), in or substantially in the form attached hereto as Schedule \"7\", or otherwise in a form acceptable to the Parties, acting reasonably, and to the Escrow Agent (the \"Escrow Agreement\"), providing for the release of the Source Code for the Software, as modified pursuant to Section 3 and all necessary programming documentation, utilities and tools used by Ehave to maintain the Software and to compile the source code into object code (excluding third party utilities and tools licensed by Ehave for which Ehave has not been granted the right to sublicense or otherwise make available such utilities and tools to third parties without additional charge, but including such information as necessary for CHT to obtain licenses to and obtain such third party utilities and tools), all in its then-existing form, to CHT, in the certain circumstances expressly stated in Section 12(b). The Escrow Agreement shall provide that the Software, including the Source Code and object code, Specifications and related documentation are and shall be deemed to be \"intellectual property\" and the rights under the Escrow Agreement and the license granted under Section 12(a)(iii) are deemed to be \"rights to use intellectual property\" for purposes of section 65.11(7) of the BIA and section 32(6) of the CCAA. (ii) Upon release of the Source Code by the Escrow Agent to CHT pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement, Ehave hereby warrants that such Source Code and other materials are and will be the then current version of the Software as used by CHT in its provision to End Users of the eEhave Companion Solution under the Subscription Agreements and that Ehave shall throughout the Term keep the Source Code so deposited with the Escrow Agent current by periodically submitting material updates to the Escrow Agent from time to time, as necessary.

CHT may use third parties to perform its foregoing rights, provided that any such third parties are not competitors of Ehave and shall be subject to confidentiality obligations. CHT expressly agrees, however, that CHT shall not exercise any of the foregoing right and license unless and until CHT obtains such Source Code from the Escrow Agent. CHT's obligations with respect to confidentiality and use of the Source Code shall be equivalent to CHT's obligations set forth in Section 13 of this Agreement.

CHT shall have the right to exercise all rights and elections under the BIA and CCAA and all other applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws with respect to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the subject matter hereof and thereof.

CONFIDENTIALITY (a) Obligation: Each Party acknowledges that all Confidential Information consists of confidential and proprietary information of the disclosing Party. Each Party shall, and shall cause its employees, agents and contractors to hold Confidential Information of the other Party in confidence, and shall use the same degree of care by instruction, agreement or otherwise, to maintain the confidentiality of the other Party's Confidential Information that it uses to maintain the confidentiality of its own Confidential Information, but with at least a reasonable degree of care commensurate with the nature and importance of such Confidential Information. Each Party agrees not to make use of Confidential Information other than for the exercise of rights or the performance of obligations under this Agreement (and the Source Code Escrow Agreement), and not to release, disclose, communicate it or make it available to any third person other than employees, agents and contractors of the Party who reasonably need to know it in connection with the exercise of rights or the performance of obligations by such Party under this Agreement (and the Source Code Escrow Agreement) and who are bound by confidentiality and restricted use obligations at least as protective of the Confidential Information as those set forth herein. Each Party agrees to notify the other Party in writing promptly of any loss or unauthorized disclosure or use of such other Party's Confidential Information and cooperate with such other Party to protect the confidentiality and ownership of all Intellectual Property Rights and other rights therein. (b) Subpoena: In the event that any Party receives a request to disclose all or any part of the Confidential Information of the other Party under the terms of a valid and effective subpoena or order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a Governmental Authority, such Party agrees to (i) immediately notify the other Party of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a request; (ii) consult with the other Party on the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such request; and (iii) if disclosure of such Confidential Information is required, exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, and/or assist the other Party to obtain, at the other Party's expense, an order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of the disclosed Confidential Information which the other Party so designates. (c) Injunctive Relief: Each Party acknowledges and agrees that any unauthorized use or disclosure by it of any of the other Party's Confidential Information, in whole or part, will cause irreparable damage to the disclosing Party, that monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy and that the amount of such damages would be extremely difficult to measure. The receiving Party agrees that the disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief to restrain the receiving Party from any unauthorized disclosure or use. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as preventing the disclosing Party from pursuing any and all remedies available to it for a breach or threatened breach of a covenant made in this Section 13, including the recovery of monetary damages from the receiving Party.\n\n20.\n\nSource: EHAVE, INC., 20-F, 5/15/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n14.

If such Claim has occurred, or in Ehave's opinion is likely to occur, without limiting Ehave's obligation to defend and indemnify the CHT Indemnified Parties as aforesaid, Ehave may, at its option and expense, either procure for CHT the right to continue using the Ehave Companion Solution in accordance with this Agreement or modify or replace the same so that it becomes non-infringing without loss of functionality, or if none of the foregoing alternatives is reasonably available and at Ehave's discretion, discontinue the use of the Ehave Companion Solution on not less than sixty (60) Business Days' prior written notice to CHT and its End Users.

The Parties agree to discuss their differences in good faith and to attempt, with the assistance of the mediator, to reach an amicable resolution of the dispute. The mediation shall be treated as a settlement discussion and therefore shall be confidential. The mediator may not testify for either Party in any later proceeding relating to the dispute. No recording or transcript shall be made of the mediation proceedings. Each Party shall bear its own costs and legal fees in the mediation. The Parties shall share the fees and expenses of the mediator equally.

After evaluating a number of different options, we determined that the flexibility and quality of BISYS'  TOTALPLUS (R) system would best serve our needs today and for years to come.\"\n\nUnited Financial  Services, a third party services provider that United National Bancorp owns with another joint venture  partner,  currently handles the Bank's information  processing  services,  item processing and deposit  services.  As a result of its planned move to BISYS,  United  National will be  liquidating  its interest  in United  Financial  Services  during the first half of 1999 after it goes live with BISYS.\n\n\"Our  investment  in United  Financial  Services  has made a great deal of sense since we established it in 1995,\" said Mr. Gregor.  \"United Financial  Services has allowed  United  National to realize  significant  efficiencies  through the sharing of technology and processing  costs.

Company shall allow at least seven (7) business days notice of any proposed public disclosure for JHU's review and comment or to provide written consent. 9.5 Duties of the Parties: JHU is not a commercial organization. It is an institute of research and education. Therefore, JHU has no ability to evaluate the commercial potential of any PATENT RIGHT(S), LICENSED PRODUCT(S), LICENSED SERVICE(S) or other license or rights granted in this Agreement. It is therefore incumbent upon Company to evaluate the rights and products in question, to examine the materials and information provided by JHU, and to determine for itself the validity of any PATENT RIGHT(S), its freedom to operate, and the value of any LICENSED PRODUCT(S) or LICENSED SERVICE(S) or other rights granted. 9.6 Disclaimer of Warranties: JHU does not warrant the validity of any patents or that the practice under such patents, or the manufacture, use, sale or import of LICENSED PRODUCT(S) or LICENSED SERVICE(S), shall be free from patent infringement.

Therefore, JHU requires Company to protect JHU and Inventors from such exposure to the same manner and extent to which insurance, if available, would protect JHU and Inventors. JHU and the Inventors will not, under the provisions of this Agreement or otherwise, have control over the manner in which Company or those operating for its account or third parties who purchase LICENSED PRODUCT(S) or LICENSED SERVICE(S) from any of the foregoing entities, practice the inventions of LICENSED PRODUCT(S) and LICENSED SERVICE(S).

The obligation of the Company to defend and indemnify as set out in this Paragraph 9.7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall not be limited by any other limitation of liability elsewhere in the Agreement. 9.8 Product Liability: Prior to first commercial sale of any LICENSED PRODUCT(S) or LICENSED SERVICE(S) as the case may be in any particular country, Company shall establish and maintain, in each country in which Company shall sell LICENSED PRODUCT(S) or LICENSED SERVICE(S), product liability or other appropriate insurance coverage appropriate to the risks involved in marketing LICENSED PRODUCT(S) and/or LICENSED SERVICE(S) and will annually present evidence to JHU that such coverage is being maintained. Upon JHU's request, Company will furnish JHU with a Certificate of Insurance of each product liability insurance policy obtained. JHU shall be listed as an additional insured in Company's said insurance policies. If such Product Liability insurance is underwritten on a 'claims made' basis, Company agrees that any change in underwriters during the term of this Agreement will require the purchase of 'prior acts' coverage to ensure that coverage will be continuous throughout the term of this Agreement. 9.9 Entire Agreement: This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties with respect to the obligations of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes and replaces all prior agreements, understandings, writings, and discussions between the parties relating to said subject matter.\n\nSource: VIRTUOSO SURGICAL, INC., 1-A, 12/27/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\nMay 3, 2016 9.10 Amendment & Waiver: This Agreement may be amended and any of its terms or conditions may be waived only by a written instrument executed by the authorized officials of the parties or, in the case of a waiver, by the party waiving compliance.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the form of consideration paid or payable includes securities for which there is not an active public market, in lieu of paying that portion of the fee with such securities COMPANY will make a cash payment to JHU equal to the fair market value of such securities.

If any event described in clause (i) through (iv) of the preceding sentence occurs, (x) if the Director Designee is TF, then the Farids Group shall forfeit its rights under this Agreement to designate the Director Designee as a member of the Board of Director and shall not have any right to a replacement designee and (y) if the Director Designee is an individual other than TF, then the TF Group shall designate a replacement designee who shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company and shall satisfy the eligibility requirements set forth in this Section 4.3 and such replacement designee shall thereafter constitute a \"Director Designee\" under this Agreement. The Company shall promptly notify the Farids Group in writing of any objection to the Director Designee in advance of the date on which proxy materials are mailed by the Company in connection with such election of directors.

(a) Until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, the Farids Group agrees not to make any Transfer of all or any portion of the Purchased Shares, except that the Farids Group shall be permitted to make Permitted Transfers. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Farids Group agrees that it will not effect any Transfer of Purchased Shares unless such Transfer is made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and, in either case, in compliance with all applicable state securities laws and all applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The Company agrees, and the Farids Group understands and consents, that the Company will not take any action to cause or permit the Transfer of any Purchased Shares to be made on its books (or on any register of securities maintained on its behalf) unless the Transfer is permitted by and has been made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and all applicable securities laws. The Farids Group agrees that in connection with any Transfer of Purchased Shares that is not made pursuant to a registration statement, the Company may, in its sole discretion, request an opinion, certifications and other information in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and from counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company stating that such transaction is exempt from registration under the Securities Act. (c) The Purchased Shares shall be stamped or otherwise imprinted with legends substantially similar to the following (in addition to any legend required under applicable state securities laws) or if held in electronic form, shall be held in an account by the Company's stock transfer agent subject to restrictions on Transfer substantially consistent with the following legend, which shall be furnished in accordance with applicable Law: THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE \"ACT\"), AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED, ASSIGNED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED EXCEPT (A) PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE ACT COVERING ANY SUCH TRANSACTION OR (B) PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION THEREUNDER, SUBJECT TO THE COMPANY'S RIGHT TO RECEIVE AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, CERTIFICATIONS AND OTHER INFORMATION IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY AND FROM COUNSEL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY STATING THAT SUCH TRANSACTION IS EXEMPT FROM SUCH REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS. 14\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SALE, PLEDGE, HYPOTHECATION OR TRANSFER OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF A CERTAIN STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT DATED AS OF DECEMBER 20, 2019, AMONG FARIDS & CO. LLC, EDIBLE ARRANGEMENTS, LLC AND THE COMPANY (AS THE SAME MAY BE AMENDED AND IN EFFECT FROM TIME TO TIME). NO SALE, PLEDGE, HYPOTHECATION OR TRANSFER OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY BE MADE EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF SUCH STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT. COPIES OF SUCH AGREEMENT MAY BE OBTAINED UPON WRITTEN REQUEST TO THE SECRETARY OF THE COMPANY. (d) The Farids Group acknowledges and agrees that any Transfer of the limited liability company interests, partnership interests, shares or other similar equity interests in any member of the Farids Group or a parent entity of such member will be deemed to constitute a Transfer of Purchased Shares, and any proposed Transfer of all or any portion of any such interests in any member of the Farids Group or a parent entity of such member shall be subject to compliance with the terms of this Agreement as such terms apply to the Farids Group. (e) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Farids Group may from time to time pledge, and/or grant a security interest in, some or all of the legended Purchased Shares in connection with applicable securities laws, pursuant to a bona fide margin agreement in compliance with a bona fide margin loan. Such a pledge would not be subject to approval or consent of the Company and no legal opinion of legal counsel to the pledgee, secured party or pledgor shall be required in connection with the pledge, but such legal opinion shall be required in connection with a subsequent transfer or foreclosure following default by the Farids Group transferee of the pledge. No notice shall be required of such pledge, but the Farids Group's transferee shall promptly notify the Company of any such subsequent transfer or foreclosure. The Farids Group acknowledges that the Company shall not be responsible for any pledges relating to, or the grant of any security interest in, any of the Purchased Shares or for any agreement, understanding or arrangement between the Farids Group and its pledgee or secured party. At the Farids Group's expense, the Company will execute and deliver such reasonable documentation as a pledgee or secured party of Purchased Shares may reasonably request in connection with a pledge or transfer of the Purchased Shares, including the preparation and filing of any required prospectus supplement under Rule 424(b)(3) of the Securities Act or other applicable provision of the Securities Act to appropriately amend the list of selling stockholders thereunder. (f) The legend set forth in Section 5.1(c) above shall be removed and the Company shall issue one or more certificates without such legend or any other legend to the holder of the Purchased Shares upon which it is stamped or issue to such holder by electronic delivery, if (i) such Purchased Shares are registered for resale under the Securities Act, (ii) such Purchased Shares are sold or transferred pursuant to Rule 144, or (iii) such Purchased Shares are eligible for resale under the Securities Act without regard to current public information, manner of sale or volume limitations. Any fees (with respect to the Company's transfer agent, Company counsel or otherwise) associated with the removal of such legend shall be borne by the Company. 15\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 5.2 Remedy for Prohibited Transfer. In the event that any member of the Farids Group Transfers any Purchased Shares in contravention of Section 5.1, such Transfer shall be null and void, and the Company agrees it will not take any action to effect such a Transfer nor will it treat any alleged transferee as the holder of such Purchased Shares. ARTICLE VI REGISTRATION RIGHTS Section 6.1 Demand Registration. (a) If the Company shall receive a written request (a \"Demand Request\") from the Farids Group that the Company file a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the registration of all or a portion of the Registrable Securities owned by the Farids Group, then the Company shall, subject to the limitations of this Section 6.1, effect, as expeditiously as reasonably possible, the registration under the Securities Act of all Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method of distribution thereof that the Farids Group requests to be registered, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1(c); provided, however, that any Eligible Resale Registration Statement shall be filed within 90 days following receipt of such Demand Request and any Resale Shelf Registration Statement shall be filed within 30 days following receipt of such Demand Request, as applicable. The Farids Group shall have the right to make two (2) Demand Requests on or after the date that is the second anniversary of the date of this Agreement; provided, that the Farids Group shall not make more than one (1) Demand Request within any six-month period. (b) If the Farids Group intends to distribute the Registrable Securities covered by its request by means of an underwritten public offering, it shall so advise the Company as a part of their request made pursuant to this Section 6.1. The Farids Group shall have the right to select the investment bank or banks and managers to administer any offering made in connection with a Demand Request, including the lead managing underwriter; provided that such investment banks or managers shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company; provided, further, that if the Farids Group declines to exercise such right, the Company shall select the investment bank or banks and managers to administer the offering, but the Farids Group shall continue to have such right pursuant to this Section 6.1(b) in any subsequent underwritten public offering. (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be obligated to (i) effect a registration pursuant to Section 6.1 unless the Registrable Securities requested to be registered by the Farids Group, together with all other shares of Common Stock requested to be registered by any other holder of piggyback registration rights (each, an \"Other Piggyback Holder\") pursuant to any agreement containing similar registration rights as those contained in this Article VI (such other shares, the \"Other Registrable Securities\"), are reasonably expected to result in aggregate gross cash proceeds in excess of (x) in the case of a Resale Shelf Registration Statement, three (3) million dollars ($3,000,000) and (y) in the case of any other form of registration statement, one (1) million dollars ($1,000,000) or (ii) prepare, file, effect or maintain a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (or any successor to Form S-3) or any similar shelf registration statement (other than a Resale Shelf Registration Statement) under the Securities Act for the purposes of compliance with any Demand Right pursuant to this Section 6.1. 16\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 6.2 Piggyback Registrations. (a) From and after the second anniversary of the date of this Agreement, the Company shall notify the Farids Group (unless the Farids Group has demanded such registration pursuant to Section 6.1) in writing at least five (5) business days prior to the initial public filing of any Eligible Registration Statement. Such notice from the Company shall state the intended method of distribution of the Registrable Securities included in such Eligible Registration Statement. The Company shall afford the Farids Group the opportunity to include Registrable Securities in such Eligible Registration Statement so long as it agrees to sell its Registrable Securities pursuant to the same method of distribution. If the Farids Group desires to include Registrable Securities held by it in any such Eligible Registration Statement, it shall, within four (4) business days after the above-described notice from the Company, so notify the Company in writing. Any such notice from the Farids Group shall (i) specify the amount of Registrable Securities that the Farids Group would like to include in such Eligible Registration Statement and (ii) include the agreement of the Farids Group to participate in any related underwritten offering on the same terms as the other participating Holders. Upon such written notice from the Farids Group, the Company will use its best efforts to effect the registration under the Securities Act of all Registrable Securities which the Farids Group has requested to be registered. If the Farids Group decides not to or is unable to include all of its Registrable Securities in any Eligible Registration Statement filed by the Company, the Farids Group shall nevertheless continue to have the right to include Registrable Securities in any subsequent Eligible Registration Statement as may be filed by the Company, all upon the terms and conditions set forth herein. Prior to the effectiveness of the applicable Eligible Registration Statement, the Farids Group may withdraw from such Eligible Registration Statement any of the Registrable Securities at any time upon written notice to the Company. (b) Underwriting. If the Eligible Registration Statement under which the Company gives notice under this Section 6.2 is for an underwritten offering, the Company shall so advise the Farids Group. In such event, the right of the Farids Group to be included in an Eligible Registration Statement pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall be conditioned upon the Farids Group's participation in such underwriting by executing and delivering a custody agreement and power of attorney in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company with respect to such Registrable Securities (the \"Custody Agreement and Power of Attorney\"), which Custody Agreement and Power of Attorney shall permit the Farids Group to, prior to the effectiveness of such Eligible Registration Statement, withdraw any of the Registrable Securities at any time from such Eligible Registration Statement upon written notice to the Company and the custodian. The Custody Agreement and Power of Attorney will provide, among other things, that (i) the Farids Group will, to the extent applicable, deliver to and deposit in custody with the custodian and attorney-in-fact named therein one or more certificates representing such Registrable Securities, accompanied by duly executed stock powers in blank, and irrevocably appoint said custodian and attorney-in-fact with full power and authority to act under the Custody Agreement and Power of Attorney on the Farids Group's behalf with respect to the matters specified therein, including, but not limited to, the entry into an underwriting agreement (the \"Underwriting Agreement\"\") in customary form with the underwriter(s) and such other documents and agreements reasonably required in connection with such registration or offering and (ii) the Farids Group will perform its obligations under such Underwriting Agreement and any other agreement entered into in connection with such registration and/or offering. The Farids Group also agrees to execute such other documents and agreements as the Company may reasonably request to effect the provisions of this Section 6.2 and any transactions contemplated hereby. 17\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 6.3 Priority on Registrations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VI, if the lead managing underwriter or underwriters advise, in the case of a requested registration pursuant to Section 6.1, the Farids Group or, in all other cases, the Company that marketing factors (including, but not limited to, an adverse effect on the per share offering price) require a limitation of the number of shares to be included in an underwritten offering (including Registrable Securities), then the Farids Group or the Company, as the case may be, shall so advise all holders of Registrable Securities and all Other Piggyback Holders who have requested to participate in such offering, that (i) if the requested registration is pursuant to Section 6.1, the number of shares that may be included in the underwriting shall be allocated first to the Farids Group for its own account, and second to the Company (to the extent it is selling shares of Common Stock in such offering) and the Other Piggyback Holders who have duly requested shares to be included therein on a pro rata basis based on the number of shares proposed to be sold by the Company and the number of Other Registrable Securities requested to be included by such Other Piggyback Holders, and (ii) if the requested registration is not pursuant to Section 6.1, the number of shares that may be included in the underwriting shall be allocated first to the Company for its own account (to the extent such registration was initiated by the Company) or to such Holder of Other Registrable Securities who demanded such registration pursuant to demand rights similar to those set forth in this Agreement, and second to the Company (to the extent such registration was not initiated by the Company), the Farids Group and the Other Piggyback Holders who have duly requested shares to be included therein on a pro rata basis based on the number of shares proposed to be sold by the Company (to the extent such registration was not initiated by the Company), the number of Registrable Securities requested to be included by the Farids Group and the number of Other Registrable Securities requested to be included by all such Other Piggyback Holders. For any Other Piggyback Holder which is a partnership, limited liability company or corporation, the partners, members or shareholders, as applicable, of such Other Piggyback Holder and the estates and Family Members of any such partners, members and shareholders and any trusts for the benefit of any of the foregoing Person(s) shall be deemed to be a single \"Other Piggyback Holder,\" and any pro rata reduction with respect to such \"Other Piggyback Holder\" pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall be based upon the aggregate amount of shares carrying registration rights owned by all Persons deemed to constitute such \"Other Piggyback Holder\" (as defined in this sentence). Section 6.4 Termination, Effectiveness, Postponement and Suspension of Registration. (a) Right to Terminate Registration. If the Farids Group determines for any reason not to proceed with any proposed registration requested pursuant to Section 6.1, the Farids Group shall promptly notify the Company in writing. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company shall withdraw or terminate such registration whether or not any Other Piggyback Holder has elected to include any Other Registrable Securities in such registration. In addition, the Company shall have the right to withdraw or terminate any proposed registration initiated by it and a Holder of Other Registrable Securities shall have the right to withdraw or terminate any proposed registration initiated by it, whether or not the Farids Group or any Other Piggyback Holder has elected to include Registrable Securities or Other Registrable Securities, as the case may be, in such registration. The Company shall promptly give notice of the withdrawal or termination of any registration to the Farids Group, to the extent the Farids Group has elected to participate in such registration. The Registration Expenses of any such withdrawn or terminated registration shall be borne by the Company in accordance with Section 6.5. 18\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Effectiveness of the Registration Statement. The Company shall maintain the effectiveness of the Eligible Registration Statement until the earlier of (i) the date on which all Registrable Securities included in such Eligible Registration Statement have actually been sold and (ii) the date that is (x) 180 days (in respect of a Resale Shelf Registration Statement) or (y) 90 days (in respect of any Eligible Registration Statement other than a Resale Shelf Registration Statement) from the effective date of such Eligible Registration Statement. (c) Postponement or Suspension of Registration. If the filing, initial effectiveness or continued use of an Eligible Registration Statement in respect of a registration pursuant to this Agreement at any time would require the Company to make a public disclosure of material non-public information, (1) which disclosure in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors (after consultation with external legal counsel) (x) would be required to be made in any registration statement so that such registration statement would not contain a material misstatement or omission, (y) would not be required by applicable Law to be made at such time but for the filing, effectiveness or continued use of such Eligible Registration Statement and (z) would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to effect a material proposed acquisition, disposition, financing, business opportunity, reorganization, recapitalization or similar transaction or (2) during a customary \"blackout\" period of the Company, then the Company may, upon giving prompt written notice of such determination to the Farids Group, delay the filing or initial effectiveness of, or suspend the use of, such Eligible Registration Statement; provided, that the Company shall not be permitted to do so pursuant to clause (1) above (x) more than two times during any twelve (12) month period or (y) for a period exceeding thirty (30) days on any one occasion (unless a longer period is consented to by the Farids Group) (the \"Suspension Period\"). In the event the Company exercises its rights under the preceding sentence, the Farids Group agrees to suspend, promptly upon its receipt of the notice referred to above, its use of any prospectus relating to such registration in connection with any sale or offer to sell Registrable Securities. If so requested by the Company, the Farids Group shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to the Company (at the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in the Farids Group's possession, of the prospectus relating to such Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of such notice. The Company agrees that, in the event it exercises its rights under this Section 6.4(c), it shall (i) promptly notify the Farids Group of the termination or expiration of any Suspension Period, (ii) within thirty (30) days after delivery of the notice referred to above (unless a longer period is consented to by the Farids Group), resume the process of filing or request for effectiveness, or update the suspended registration statement, as the case may be, as may be necessary to permit the Farids Group to offer and sell its Registrable Securities in accordance with applicable Law and (iii) if an Eligible Registration Statement that was already effective had been suspended as result of the exercise of such rights by the Company, promptly notify the Farids Group after the termination or expiration of any Suspension Period of the applicable time period during which the Eligible Registration Statement is to remain effective, which shall be extended by a period of time equal to the duration of the Suspension Period. 19\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 6.5 Expenses of Registration. Except as specifically provided herein, all Registration Expenses incurred in connection with any registration under Sections 6.1 and 6.2 shall be borne by the Company. All underwriting fees and selling commissions relating to the distribution of the Registrable Securities and all taxes, if any, on the transfer and sale, respectively, of the Registrable Securities being sold that are incurred in connection with any registrations hereunder shall be borne by the Farids Group. For the avoidance of doubt, all underwriting fees, selling commissions and taxes incurred in connection with any registration hereunder relating to securities sold by the Company shall be borne by the Company. Section 6.6 Obligations of the Company. If and whenever the Company is required to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities under the Securities Act as provided in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 (to the extent the Farids Group has requested to include Registrable Securities in an Eligible Registration Statement pursuant to clause (a) of such Section 6.1 or 6.2, as the case may be), the Company shall effect such registration to permit the sale of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof, and pursuant thereto the Company shall cooperate in the sale of the securities and shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible: (a) Prepare and file with the SEC an Eligible Registration Statement on such form as shall be available for the sale of the Registrable Securities by the Farids Group in accordance with the intended method of distribution thereof and the provisions of this Article VI, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause each such Eligible Registration Statement to become effective and remain effective as provided herein; provided, however, that before filing any Eligible Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto (not including documents that would be incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference), the Company shall afford the Farids Group, its counsel and the managing underwriter, if any, an opportunity to review copies of all such documents proposed to be filed. The Company shall not file any Eligible Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto in respect of which the Farids Group has a right to review prior to the filing of such document, if the Farids Group, its counsel or the managing underwriter, if any, shall reasonably object, in writing, on a timely basis. (b) Prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and post-effective amendments to each Eligible Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep such Eligible Registration Statement continuously effective for the effectiveness period; and comply with the provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to it with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such Eligible Registration Statement as so amended or in such Prospectus as so supplemented. 20\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Notify the Farids Group, its counsel and the managing underwriter, if any, promptly (but in any event within 10 business days), and confirm such notice in writing, (i) when a Prospectus or any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with respect to an Eligible Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective (including in such notice a written statement that the Farids Group may, upon request, obtain, without charge, one conformed copy of such Eligible Registration Statement or post-effective amendment including financial statements and schedules, all documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference and all exhibits), (ii) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a Eligible Registration Statement or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (iii) if at any time when a prospectus is required by the Securities Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Eligible Registrable Securities the representations and warranties of the Company contained in any agreement (including any underwriting agreement) contemplated by Section 6.6(k) below cease to be true and correct in all material respects, (iv) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of an Eligible Registration Statement or any of the Registrable Securities for offer or sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose, (v) of the happening of any event that makes any statement made in such Eligible Registration Statement or related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect or that requires the making of any changes in such Eligible Registration Statement, Prospectus or documents so that, in the case of such Eligible Registration Statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and that in the case of the Prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (vi) of the Company's reasonable determination that a post-effective amendment to an Eligible Registration Statement would be appropriate. (d) Use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any order suspending the effectiveness of an Eligible Registration Statement or of any order preventing or suspending the use of a Prospectus or suspending the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, and, if any such order is issued, to obtain the withdrawal of any such order at the earliest possible moment.

(f) Furnish to the Farids Group and each managing underwriter, if any, without charge, one conformed copy of the Eligible Registration Statement or Statements and each post-effective amendment thereto, including financial statements and schedules, all documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference and all exhibits. 21\n\n\n\n\n\n(g) Deliver to the Farids Group, its counsel and the underwriters, if any, without charge, as many copies of the Prospectus or Prospectuses (including each form of prospectus) and each amendment or supplement thereto as such Persons may reasonably request; and, the Company hereby consents to the use of such Prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto by the Farids Group and the underwriters, if any, in connection with the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by such Prospectus and an amendment or supplement thereto. (h) Prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, to use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify, and cooperate with the Farids Group, the underwriters, if any, the sales agent and their respective counsel in connection with the registration or qualification (or exemption from such registration or qualification) of such Registrable Securities for offer and sale under the securities or \"blue sky\" laws of such jurisdictions within the United States as the Farids Group or the managing underwriter, if any, reasonably request in writing; use its reasonable best efforts to keep each such registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective during the period during which the related Eligible Registration Statement is required to be kept effective and use its reasonable best efforts to do any and all other acts or things necessary or advisable to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities covered by the applicable Eligible Registration Statement; provided, however, that the Company will not be required to (A) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified or (B) take any action that would subject it to general service of process or taxation in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject. (i) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by clause (v) or (vi) of Section 6.6(c) above, as promptly as practicable prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to the Eligible Registration Statement or a supplement to the related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the Registrable Securities being sold thereunder, such Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. (j) Enter into an underwriting agreement in form, scope and substance as is customary in underwritten offerings and take all such other actions as are reasonably requested by the managing underwriter in order to expedite or facilitate the registration or the disposition of such Registrable Securities, and in such connection, (i) make such customary representations and warranties to the underwriters, with respect to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, and the Eligible Registration Statement, Prospectus and documents, if any, incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein; (ii) obtain opinions of counsel to the Company and updates thereof (which counsel and opinions shall be reasonably satisfactory (in form, scope and substance) to the managing underwriter), addressed to the underwriters covering the matters customarily covered in opinions requested in underwritten offerings and such other matters as may be reasonably requested by the underwriters; and (iii) obtain \"comfort\" letters and updates thereof from the independent certified public accountants of the Company (and, if necessary, any other independent certified public accountants of any subsidiary of the Company or of any business acquired by the Company for which financial statements and financial data are, or are required to be, included in the Eligible Registration Statement), addressed to each of the underwriters, such letters to be in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in \"comfort\" letters in connection with underwritten offerings. The above shall be done at each closing under such underwriting agreement, or as and to the extent required thereunder. 22\n\n\n\n\n\n(k) Use its reasonable best efforts to cause all Registrable Securities covered by such Eligible Registration Statement to be listed on each securities exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed.

Section 6.7 Delay of Registration; Furnishing Information. It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the Company to take any action pursuant to Section 6.1 or 6.2 that the Farids Group shall furnish to the Company such information regarding itself, the Registrable Securities held by it and the intended method of distribution of such securities as required by Section 6.12 or as otherwise reasonably requested by the Company. Section 6.8 Indemnification. In the event any Registrable Securities are included in an Eligible Registration Statement under Section 6.1 or 6.2: (a) To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless the Farids Group, the partners, members, directors and officers of any member of the Farids Group, any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act), the directors and officers of such underwriter, and each person, if any, who controls any member of the Farids Group or such underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (collectively, the \"Non-Company Indemnified Parties\"), against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (joint or several) to which they may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or suits, actions or proceedings in respect thereof) and reasonable documented expenses that arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations by the Company: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such Eligible Registration Statement or incorporated by reference therein, including any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto or any document incorporated by reference therein, or any other such disclosure document (including reports and other documents filed under the Exchange Act and any document incorporated by reference therein) or related document or report, (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein (in the case of an Eligible Registration Statement only), or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in the case of a prospectus, in the light of the circumstances when they were made, or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any federal, state, foreign or common law, rule or regulation in connection with the offering covered by such Eligible Registration Statement (collectively, a \"Violation\"); and the Company will reimburse each such Non-Company Indemnified Party for any reasonable legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, suit, action or proceeding; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 6.8(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, suit, action or proceeding if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, nor shall the Company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability, suit, action or proceeding to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such Eligible Registration Statement by such Non-Company Indemnified Party. 23\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Farids Group will, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act), the directors and officers of such underwriter, and each person, if any, who controls such underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which the Company or any such director, officer, employee, agent, representative, controlling person or underwriter may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or suits, actions or proceedings in respect thereof) and reasonable documented expenses that arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such Eligible Registration Statement or incorporated by reference therein, including any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto or any document incorporated by reference therein, or any other such disclosure document (including reports and other documents filed under the Exchange Act and any document incorporated by reference therein) or related document or report, (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein (in the case of an Eligible Registration Statement only), or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in the case of a prospectus, in the light of the circumstances when they were made, or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any federal, state, foreign or common law, rule or regulation in connection with the offering covered by such Eligible Registration Statement (collectively, a \"Holder Violation\"), in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such Holder Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by the Farids Group expressly for use in connection with such Eligible Registration Statement; and the Farids Group will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer, employee, agent, representative, controlling person or underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, suit, action or proceeding if it is judicially determined that there was such a Holder Violation; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 6.8(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, suit, action or proceeding if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Farids Group, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; provided, further, that in no event shall any indemnity under this Section 6.8(b) exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by the Farids Group upon the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. 24\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 6.8 (an \"Indemnified Party\") of written notice of the commencement of any claim, damage, suit, action or proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation) being brought or asserted against it, such Indemnified Party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 6.8 (an \"Indemnifying Party\"), deliver to the Indemnifying Party a written notice of the commencement thereof; provided, that the failure of the Indemnified Party to deliver written notice to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability it may have under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 6.8 except to the extent such failure has materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend such action (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses). The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the Indemnifying Party so desires, jointly with any other Indemnifying Party who has received a similar notice, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to represent the Indemnified Party in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel relating to such proceeding, and after notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall not, except as specified below, be liable to such Indemnified Party under paragraph (a) or (b) above, as the case may be, for any legal expenses of other counsel. In any such proceeding, an Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the Indemnified Party; provided the Indemnifying Party will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel if (i) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have so mutually agreed; (ii) the Indemnifying Party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; (iii) the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded, based on the advice of counsel, that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Party; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel that is required to effectively defend against any such proceeding) for all Indemnified Parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be paid or reimbursed promptly. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Party agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party. 25\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.8 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an Indemnified Party with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to herein, the Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party thereunder, shall to the extent permitted by applicable Law contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party on the one hand and of the Indemnified Party on the other in connection with the actions that resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and of the Indemnified Party shall be determined by a court of law by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Indemnifying Party or by the Indemnified Party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; provided, that in no event shall any contribution by a Holder hereunder exceed the net proceeds from the offering made under such Eligible Registration Statement received by such Holder. (e) The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to Section 6.8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. (f) The obligations of the Company and the Farids Group under this Section 6.8 shall survive completion of any offering of Registrable Securities in an Eligible Registration Statement and the termination of this Agreement. (g) The obligations of the parties under this Section 6.8 will be in addition to any liability, without duplication, which any party may otherwise have to any other party. Section 6.9 \"Market Stand-Off\" Agreement. The Farids Group hereby agrees that the Farids Group shall not Transfer, make any short sale of, grant any option for the purchase of, or enter into any hedging or similar transaction with the same economic effect as a sale or other Transfer, any Lock-Up Security held by the Farids Group (other than those included in the registration) for a period specified by the representative(s) of the underwriters of Registrable Securities or any other securities sold in any offering in respect of which the Farids Group received notice from the Company in accordance with Section 6.2, such period not to exceed one hundred and eighty (180) days following the pricing date of any underwritten offering; provided that the Farids Group shall only be required to comply with this Section 6.9 if the Farids Group beneficially own (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, or any successor provision) at least 3.0% or more of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at such time. The Company may impose stop transfer instructions with respect to any Lock-Up Security subject to the foregoing restriction until the end of said one hundred and eighty (180) day or shorter period. 26\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 6.10 Agreement to Furnish Information. The Farids Group agrees to execute and deliver such other agreements as may be reasonably requested by the Company or the representative(s) of the underwriter(s) that are consistent with the Farids Group's obligations under Section 6.9 or that are necessary to give further effect thereto. In addition, if requested by the Company or such representative(s), the Farids Group shall provide, to the extent the Farids Group has elected to include Registrable Securities in an Eligible Registration Statement, within one (1) business day of such request, such information relating to itself, the Registrable Securities held by it and the registration and the intended method of distribution of the Registrable Securities as may be reasonably requested by the Company or such representative(s) in connection with the completion of any public offering of Common Stock pursuant to such Eligible Registration Statement. The underwriters of Registrable Securities are intended third party beneficiaries of Sections 6.8 and 6.10 and shall have the right, power and authority to enforce the provisions hereof as though they were a party hereto. Section 6.11 Termination. The rights and obligations of the Farids Group set forth in this Article VI (other than those set forth in Sections 6.8 and 6.9) shall terminate on the date that the Farids Group owns less than 3% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock, but in no event earlier than the Expiration Date (as defined in the Warrant).

If Excite                           fails to deliver the indicated number of impressions                           required during any annual period, Client may suspend                           (but not eliminate) its payments specified in Section                           7 for a maximum of sixty (60) days (the \"Make-Good                           Period) during which Excite will deliver the                           shortfall of such impressions.  The parties agree to                           cooperate in good faith to evaluate the quality and                           performance of the placements used to deliver the                           impressions during the Make-Good Period.  Until such                           shortfall is delivered, no impressions will be deemed                           delivered for the next annual period.

If                           Excite achieves the annual impression delivery goal                           at any time during the Make-Good Period, the term of                           this Agreement will continue and Client shall                           immediately resume payment of the sponsorship and                           advertising fees specified in Section 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    9    10                             CONFIDENTIAL MATERIALS OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY                                     WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

Descriptions of the services and technologies to be leveraged throughout the\n\n\n\n\n\noptimization process are highlighted below.\n\nCENTRALIZED AD SERVING Through its proprietary centralized ad serving infrastructure, MatchLogic will facilitate the trafficking, delivery, tracking and reporting of Client's banners throughout the Excite Network.  During the ad management process, MatchLogic will employ TrueCount(sm) cache counting techniques as the underlying measurement technology for the reporting of client campaign performance data.  Basic campaign performance data including primary impressions, clicks, click %, cache impressions and total impressions will be supplied to Client daily through an online interface.\n\nTRUEFFECT(sm) TruEffect(sm) refers to the process of establishing, tracking and communicating the relationship between locations from which users have interacted with Client's marketing messages and the activities they engaged in at the Client Site as a result of these interactions.  TruEffect(sm) measurement will allow Client to directly relate user activity within the Client Site to marketing messages within the Excite Network.  As a result of these measurements, Client will have the ability to optimize campaigns in order to drive actual user activities or transactions.  Client will be able to identify the number of unique visitors coming to the Client Site or promotional areas, from which message and area they originated, and the number of measurable transactions these visitors performed.  Additionally, measurements of reach and frequency will accompany this analysis.\n\nUpon successful implementation of TruEffect(sm), performance reporting will be available to Client on a daily basis through an online interface.\n\nLANDSCAPE(sm) LandscapE(sm) demographic profile reports will afford Client an effective means of understanding the visitor segments exposed to Client's messages or interacting with Client sponsored content areas within the Excite Network.  All of the information contained within the demographic profiles is derived from consumers who have been both exposed to an advertising campaign and are also within MatchLogic's Digital 1:1(sm) database (MatchLogic's proprietary consumer database).  When a subset of unique visitors taken from all visitors exposed to a Client's marketing message or content area are matched against the Digital 1:1(sm) database, demographic profiles are derived.  The matched records create a sample of visitors that are used to demographically represent and statistically profile\n\n                                    19    20                             CONFIDENTIAL MATERIALS OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY                                     WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

These profiles will allow Client to compare its understanding of its customers offline to its customers online as a basis for more effective segmenting and future targeting.\n\nLandscapE(sm) reports are generated on a campaign basis and will include measurements of campaign reach by Age, Gender, Age/Gender, Household Income, and Household Income/Age.  These reports will be made available to Client once statistically significant profiles have been established.\n\nTRUESELECT(sm) TrueSelect(sm) is MatchLogic's centralized advertising targeting system. TrueSelect(sm) enables MatchLogic to project demographics of users across the Internet based on our Digital 1:1 database, user traffic and user search patterns.  The first implementation of this technology will be Virtual Keywords slated for release in 4Q98.  Virtual Keywords will allow MatchLogic to actively target a user on the Excite Network based on the user's input of search terms at a previous point in time.  TrueSelect(sm) will be able to track and target users by Virtual Keywords on both an inter-day and intra-day basis.  Following Virtual Keywords, TrueSelect(sm) capabilities will enable marketers to actively target specific users based on predetermined demographic or lifestyle information in real time.\n\nUpon release of this technology, delivery of TrueSelect(sm) targeted messaging for Client is highly dependent on a number of qualifying criteria.  A critical qualifier for the implementation of TrueSelect(sm) will be the establishment of a significant behavioral profile target for Client's customers as highlighted within the LandscapE(sm) services description above.\n\nDELIVERE(sm) DeliverE(sm), MatchLogic's email marketing service will be leveraged to deliver email marketing campaigns on behalf of Vitamin Shoppe.  The DeliverE(sm) team will consult with Client to evaluate current business objectives (branding, acquisition, retention, reactivation, etc.) and develop e-mail strategies that meet these specific objectives.  Once appropriate strategies have been established, MatchLogic will target both MatchLogic and Excite registered users for the facilitation of the Client's program.  Performance results for these campaigns will be provided to Client and assist in the development of strategies for subsequent e-mail campaigns.\n\n\n\n\n\nProjected delivery schedules for DeliverE(sm) services over the [*****]-year term of this agreement are as follows.\n\n                                    20    21                             CONFIDENTIAL MATERIALS OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY                                     WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.
