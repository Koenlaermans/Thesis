If there is any discrepancy or conflict between the terms contained in a Protocol or workscope and this Agreement and/or the relevant Study Order, the terms of the Protocol or workscope shall govern and control with respect to clinical/scientific matters and the terms of the Agreement and/or the relevant Study Order in that order shall govern and control with respect to all other matters, e.g., legal and financial matters.   1.3 Adaptimmune agrees to commit funding in an amount of at least nineteen million six hundred and forty four thousand Dollars US ($19,644,000) for the performance of the Studies as set out in Exhibit I during the term (\"Alliance Funding\"). The JSC may allocate and/or re-allocate funds to Studies as necessary and agreed by JSC. The basic per patient estimate for Clinical Studies is as follows: for screening Clinical Studies: $***, for long term follow-up Clinical Studies: $*** and for other Clinical Studies: $***. If the Parties extend the term by mutual agreement as set forth herein, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith the amount of future Study funding commitments by Adaptimmune applicable to such extended term. In the event a Study is terminated early, then in relation to any funds allocated to such Study, the Parties shall promptly discuss and agree upon a replacement of that Study with a new study of similar scope that is of mutual scientific interest to the Parties and that is approved by the JSC, and that will be funded by the Alliance Funding. If there is any Alliance Funding at the expiration or termination of this Agreement, it will be allocated to studies, research or tests agreed by the JSC, and such Alliance Funding will be payable in accordance with agreed milestones relevant to such agreed studies, research or tests.   The Parties understand that the compensation being paid to MD Anderson under this Agreement constitutes the fair market value of the services to be provided hereunder. Neither MD Anderson nor Principal Investigator shall seek or accept reimbursement from any third-party payor for any Study items or procedures supplied by or paid for by Adaptimmune under this Agreement. MD Anderson acknowledges that Adaptimmune may be obligated to disclose all payments made hereunder, including the provision of non-monetary items of value, as may be required under Applicable Law, including the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, passed as Section 6002 of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and, to the extent required by Applicable Laws, agrees to keep and maintain relevant records of such and, upon Adaptimmune's reasonable request, provide such records to Adaptimmune to the extent such information is not already in Adaptimmune's possession, but only to the extent required for Adaptimmune to comply with its legally required reporting obligations. MD Anderson consents to such disclosure, to the extent such disclosure is required for Adaptimmune to comply with Applicable Laws. MD Anderson shall ensure that the Principal Investigator provides in a timely manner all such reasonable information to Adaptimmune necessary for Adaptimmune to comply with any disclosure requirements to the extent required by and in accordance with 21 C.F.R. Part 54, including but not limited to, any information required to be disclosed in connection with any financial relationship between Adaptimmune and the Principal Investigators and sub-investigators involved in the Study, as well as any immediate family members thereof. MD Anderson will ensure that Principal Investigator promptly updates any provided information if any relevant changes occur during the performance of any Study and for one year following completion of any Study.\n\n***  Portions of this page have been omitted pursuant to a request for Confidential Treatment and filed separately with the Commission.   2\n\n\n\n\n\n  No amounts paid under this Agreement are intended to be for, nor shall they be construed as, an offer or payment made in exchange for any explicit or implicit agreement to purchase, prescribe, recommend, or provide a favorable formulary status, for any Adaptimmune product or service. Any such compensation will be consistent with fair market value in arms-length transactions and will not be determined in a manner that takes into account the volume or value of any referrals or business otherwise generated between the Parties for which payment may be made in whole or in part under Medicare, Medicaid or other Federal health care programs. MD Anderson and Adaptimmune each confirm that in entering into this Agreement they have not accepted any bribes or illegal inducements to enter into this Agreement or to perform any Study and will not accept any bribe or illegal inducement or offer any bribe or illegal inducement in the performance of or for the performance of any Study whether during or after the termination or expiry of this Agreement.     1.4 The nineteen million six hundred and forty four thousand Dollars US ($19,644,000) for the Studies shall be due and payable to MD Anderson according to the schedule outlined in Table 2 in Exhibit II. The JSC retains the right to prioritize and replace Studies as necessary subject to Section 1.6.   1.5 The Parties will establish a Joint Steering Committee (\"JSC\") of equal representation, comprised of three (3) representatives (employees, directors or consultants who are subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations) from each Party, with the representatives of each Party collectively having one vote on all matters to be decided upon by the JSC. Each Party can appoint and replace its representatives in the JSC at its own discretion through timely written notice to the other Party.   1.6 The JSC will have meetings (either in person, by teleconference or via electronic means) at least quarterly. At least one meeting per year will be conducted in person or by videoconference (including the kick-off meeting). The JSC will decide on matters by unanimous vote with each of MD Anderson and Adaptimmune exercising one vote each provided, however, that no action may lawfully be taken at any meeting unless at least two representatives of each Party (including for this purpose any proxy representative appointed as provided below) are present at the meeting.  If a member of the JSC is unable to attend a meeting, he or she may appoint, in writing, a proxy to participate and vote in his or her stead. Decisions may also be made by electronic mail, provided such electronic mail is provided by at least two representatives from Adaptimmune and MD Anderson and such electronic mail is acknowledged to be received by the recipient. Although decision will be made by mutual agreement of the JSC, in the event of any disagreement, ***           .   1.7 The main task of the JSC will be to oversee the Alliance. In order to achieve the objectives of the Alliance, the JSC will oversee each Study under the Alliance. The JSC will provide technical, scientific, clinical, and regulatory guidance to the Studies and will be responsible for monitoring progress of these Studies. Additional representatives can be invited by the JSC on a case by case basis should discussion of certain topics require so, provided that such guests will be subject to an obligation of confidentiality and non-use at least as strict as Section 5 below. In the event a Study is terminated early or does not initiate, the Parties shall promptly replace that Study with a new study similar in scope that is of mutual scientific interest to the Parties. Once agreed by the JSC, such replacement study will be funded by the Alliance Funding and payable in accordance with agreed milestones for such replacement study.\n\n***  Portions of this page have been omitted pursuant to a request for Confidential Treatment and filed separately with the Commission.   3\n\n\n\n\n\n  1.8 In addition, the JSC will be responsible for coordinating resolution of problems arising in the Studies or in the Alliance as a whole. In the event of any matter to which the JSC cannot reach resolution, or in the event of any dispute arising as to any matter subject to JSC responsibility and save where Adaptimmune has the deciding vote in accordance with Section 1.6 above, such matter or dispute will be escalated to executive management of MD Anderson and Adaptimmune for good faith resolution. Both Parties shall use all reasonable efforts to resolve any matter or dispute on a timely basis.   1.9 MD Anderson represents and certifies that neither MD Anderson nor Principal Investigator will, directly or indirectly, offer or pay, or authorize an offer or payment of, any money or anything of value to any Public Official (defined below) or public entity, with the knowledge or intent that the payment, promise or gift, in whole or in part, will be made in order to improperly influence an official act or decision that will assist Adaptimmune in securing an improper advantage or in obtaining or retaining business or in directing business to any person or entity in relation to the Study.  In addition to other rights or remedies under this Agreement or at law, Adaptimmune may terminate the affected Study Order if MD Anderson breaches any of the representations or certifications contained in this Section or if Adaptimmune learns that improper payments are being or have been made to any Public Official by MD Anderson or Investigator.

Data will be promptly disclosed by MD Anderson to Adaptimmune in the form of a Study report or as otherwise reasonably requested by Adaptimmune. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, MD Anderson shall have the right to use results and Data of the Study for its internal research, academic, and patient care purposes and for publication in accordance with Section 12 below, save that no right or license is granted to MD Anderson under any of Adaptimmune's Background IP. Adaptimmune shall promptly disclose any Data it generates to MD Anderson.   7.3 MD Anderson will provide to Adaptimmune a detailed written disclosure of each patentable invention and/or discovery (and all intellectual property rights therein) conceived and reduced to practice in the conduct of a Study and arising from the performance of a Study (\"Invention\") promptly after a written invention disclosure report for such Invention is received by MD Anderson's Office of Technology Commercialization.   7.4 Inventions shall be owned by the Parties in accordance with the following: (a) ***               \"Adaptimmune Inventions\" shall be the sole property of Adaptimmune Limited.   (b) With respect to any Inventions that are not Adaptimmune Inventions (\"Other Inventions\"), where made solely by MD Anderson or its employees and agents, such Inventions will be solely owned by MD Anderson; where made jointly by MD Anderson and Adaptimmune and/or Adaptimmune Limited and their employees and agents will be jointly owned by MD Anderson and Adaptimmune Limited. Inventions that are made solely by Adaptimmune, Adaptimmune Limited or its employees and agents will be solely owned by Adaptimmune Limited. Inventorship will be determined in accordance with United States patent law.   7.5  MD Anderson hereby grants Adaptimmune and Adaptimmune Limited a non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable royalty-free license to any Invention in which MD Anderson has an ownership interest, for any purpose. Such license shall include an unrestricted right to sublicense through multiple tiers. MD Anderson also hereby grants to Adaptimmune Limited an exclusive option to negotiate an\n\n***  Portions of this page have been omitted pursuant to a request for Confidential Treatment and filed separately with the Commission.   11\n\n\n\n\n\n  exclusive (subject to MD Anderson's perpetual, irrevocable, no-cost right to use such Invention for non-commercial internal research, academic and patient care purposes), royalty-bearing license to any Invention in which MD Anderson has an ownership interest, provided that Adaptimmune Limited pays all reasonably incurred patent expenses for such Invention in the event Adaptimmune Limited exercises its option. Adaptimmune Limited must exercise its option to negotiate a license to any Invention by notifying MD Anderson in writing within six months' of MD Anderson disclosing such Invention to Adaptimmune (the \"Option Period\").  If Adaptimmune Limited fails to timely exercise its option within the Option Period with respect to any Invention, Adaptimmune Limited's right to negotiate a license agreement with respect to such Invention will automatically terminate, and MD Anderson will be free to negotiate and enter into a license with any other party. If Adaptimmune Limited timely exercises its option, the terms of the license shall be negotiated in good faith within six months of the date such option is exercised, or within such time the parties may mutually agree in writing (the \"Negotiation Period\"). If, however, Adaptimmune Limited timely exercises its option, but MD Anderson and Adaptimmune Limited are unable to agree upon the terms of the license during the Negotiation Period, Adaptimmune Limited's right to exclusively license such Invention will terminate, and MD Anderson will be free to enter into a license with any other party (subject to the grant of the non-exclusive license above).   7.6. Adaptimmune Limited hereby grants MD Anderson a perpetual, irrevocable, no-cost, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to any Adaptimmune Invention or Other Invention in which Adaptimmune Limited has an ownership interest for MD Anderson's internal non-commercial research, academic and patient care purposes. For clarity the grant of any license under any Invention or assignment of any Invention by either Party does not include any license under any of such Party's Background IP, even where such Background IP dominates or encompasses any Invention.   7.7 As between the Parties, the sole owner of any Invention will have the sole right to prepare, file, prosecute, maintain, enforce and defend all U.S. and foreign patents, registrations and other forms of intellectual property in such Invention but nothing herein will obligate the owner to take any such actions. As between the Parties, Adaptimmune will have the first right to prepare, file, prosecute, maintain, enforce and defend all U.S. and foreign patents, registrations and other forms of intellectual property in any jointly-owned Invention using patent counsel of its choice that is subject to the written approval of MD Anderson not to be unreasonably withheld and at the sole cost and expense of Adaptimmune, with accounting to MD Anderson.  Adaptimmune will keep MD Anderson reasonably informed of all such material preparations, filings, material prosecution, material maintenance, material enforcement and defense and will consider MD Anderson's recommendations in good faith (provided such recommendations are provided on a timely basis) If Adaptimmune elects not to file in the United States or not to maintain an application or patent arising from any jointly-owned Invention, Adaptimmune will promptly notify MD Anderson within reasonable time for MD Anderson to file, prosecute or maintain such application or patent, and MD Anderson will have the right to file, prosecute or maintain such application or patent, at MD Anderson's expense. MD Anderson will keep Adaptimmune reasonably informed of all such material preparations, material filings, material prosecution, material maintenance, material enforcement and defense it makes in relation to any jointly-owned Invention. The Parties will reasonably cooperate with each other with respect to matters concerning jointly-owned Inventions to the extent reasonably necessary for filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending or enforcing any such patents, registrations and other forms of intellectual property protection. MD Anderson will keep Adaptimmune reasonably informed of any material filings, material prosecution, enforcement and defense patents, new patent applications, material registrations or other forms of intellectual property covering Other Inventions.   7.8 ***\n\n***  Portions of this page have been omitted pursuant to a request for Confidential Treatment and filed separately with the Commission.   12\n\n\n\n\n\n            .   8. Term and Termination   8.1 The term of this Agreement shall be five (5) years following the Effective Date or until the Studies are completed, whichever is later,  unless extended or unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions hereof.  In the event of expiration or early termination of this Agreement, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall remain binding with respect to any ongoing Studies (including any new studies to which any remaining Alliance Funding is allocated under Section 1.3) until completion of the Studies or termination of the respective Study Order/s.   8.2 A Party will have the right to terminate this Agreement if the other Party commits a material breach of the Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of receiving notice from the non-breaching Party of such breach.  Any expiration or termination of this Agreement will not affect any then existing Study Orders, and any then outstanding Study Orders will continue after the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with their respective provisions. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, provisions of this Agreement that are incorporated by reference into any then outstanding Study Orders will survive termination of this Agreement and will continue to apply to such Study Orders until termination or expiration of each such Study Orders in effect at the time this Agreement expires or is terminated.   8.3 A Party may terminate a Study Order: (a) if the other Party commits a material breach of this Agreement or the Study Order and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of receiving notice from the non-breaching Party of such breach; or (b) in the case of any Clinical Studies, due to health and safety concerns related to the Study Drug or procedures in the Study (including regulatory holds due to the health and safety of the Study Subjects); or (c) in the case of MD Anderson and in relation to any Clinical Studies, where IRB requests termination of any Study; or (d) in the case of Adaptimmune, *** set out in Section 1.2 above. The Parties agree that any termination of a Study Order shall allow for: (i) the wind down of the Study to ensure the safety of Study subjects; and (ii) Adaptimmune's final reconciliation of Data related to the Study in addition to Adaptimmune's final monitoring visit. All reasonable fees associated with the wind-down activities and final monitoring visit shall be paid by Adaptimmune, to the extent not covered by Alliance Funding. Termination of one or more Study Orders will not automatically result in the termination of this Agreement or termination of any other Study Orders. Upon termination of a Study Order, MD Anderson will immediately return (at Adaptimmune's cost) any Study Drugs provided by Adaptimmune for such Study as directed by Adaptimmune.   8.4 In case any regulatory or legal authorization necessary for the conduct of the Study is (i) finally rejected or (ii) withdrawn, the relevant Study Order shall terminate automatically at the date of receipt of such final rejection. Termination or cancellation of this Agreement or a Study Order will not affect the rights and obligations of the Parties that have accrued prior to termination, and any provisions of this Agreement or a particular Study Order that by their nature extend beyond expiration or termination will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement and/or that particular Study Order. In particular, the provisions of Sections 2-13 as applicable will survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n***  Portions of this page have been omitted pursuant to a request for Confidential Treatment and filed separately with the Commission.   13\n\n\n\n\n\n  8.5 In the event the Parties cannot reach agreement on a new Principal Investigator pursuant to Section 14.1 or such new Principal Investigator does not agree to the terms of this Agreement and the relevant Study Order, either Party may terminate such Study Order upon notice to the other Party.   8.6 In addition, in order to accommodate the review and approval of this Agreement by the Office of General Counsel of UT System (the \"OGC\"), for a period of *** (***) days following the Effective Date (the \"Limited Unilateral Termination Period\"), MD Anderson will have the right to terminate this Agreement without cause upon ten (10) days' notice to Adaptimmune; provided, however, that (i) a termination by MD Anderson will be effective if notice of termination is sent by MD Anderson any time within the Limited Unilateral Termination Period even if the ten day notice period extends beyond the Limited Unilateral Termination Period and (ii) the Limited Unilateral Termination Period will expire on the earlier to occur of (x) the end of the sixty days, or (y) written notice to Adaptimmune from MD Anderson that the Agreement has been approved by the OGC. Should MD Anderson terminate this Agreement in accordance with this Section 8.6 then the Parties will use reasonable efforts to ensure that any Clinical Study in relation to which any patient has been screened or enrolled shall continue under a separate clinical trial agreement to be entered into between the Parties as soon as possible after receipt of notice of termination by Adaptimmune. The terms of such clinical trial agreement shall be in substantially similar form to terms agreed for other clinical trial agreements between the Parties and a separate budget shall be agreed pursuant to such clinical trial agreement.   8.7 For each Study, Adaptimmune shall make all payments due for Study performance reasonably incurred or obligated in good faith hereunder which have accrued up to the date of termination of a Study Order or this Agreement, or, in case of a termination of this Agreement or the relevant Study Order pursuant to Section 8.4, up to the date of receipt of such final rejection.   9. Indemnification   9.1 Adaptimmune and Adaptimmune Limited agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless MD Anderson, System, each Principal Investigator and its/their Regents, trustees, directors, officers, staff, employees, students, faculty members, and its/their affiliates and contracted clients and other parties as may be listed on a Study Order (\"Indemnified Party/ies\"): (a) from and against any and all liability, claims, lawsuits, losses, demands, damages, costs, and expenses as a result of third party claims or judgments (\"Indemnified Losses\") resulting from (i) personal injury (including death) to any person or damage to property to the extent arising from the design or manufacture of the Study Drug, and (ii) the use of the Data or results of the Study by or on behalf of Adaptimmune, Adaptimmune Limited or any Joint Research Partner and (iii) Adaptimmune's or Adaptimmune Limited's negligence in connection with a Study or this Agreement; (b) from and against any Indemnified Losses arising from an injury to a Study subject caused by the Study Drug or any procedure required by the Protocol.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Adaptimmune and Adaptimmune Limited will not be responsible for any Indemnified Losses to the extent that they arise from the negligence, intentional misconduct, or malpractice of the Indemnified Parties or of any breach of the terms of this Agreement by any Indemnified Party, it being understood that the proper administration of the Study Drug in accordance with the Protocol (including permitted deviations) shall not constitute negligence, intentional misconduct, or malpractice for the purposes of this Agreement. For clarity, a request for indemnity by any Indemnified Party under this Section 9.1 may only be made against one of Adaptimmune or Adaptimmune Limited.   9.2 To the extent authorized by the constitution and laws of the State of Texas, MD Anderson, agrees indemnify, and hold harmless Adaptimmune and Adaptimmune Limited: (a) from and against any and all\n\n***  Portions of this page have been omitted pursuant to a request for Confidential Treatment and filed separately with the Commission.   14\n\n\n\n\n\n  Indemnified Losses resulting from any negligent or intentional act or omission of MD Anderson in conducting a Study hereunder; (b) failure of MD Anderson or Principal Investigator to comply with Applicable Laws or to adhere to Protocol; or (c) any use by MD Anderson of the results and Data of the Study outside of the performance of any Study. The completion or termination of a Study shall not affect MD Anderson's obligation to indemnify with respect to any claim or suit based upon the aforementioned Indemnified Losses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, MD Anderson will not be responsible for any Indemnified Losses to the extent that they arise from the negligence, intentional misconduct, or malpractice of Adaptimmune or Adaptimmune Limited or from a breach of Agreement by Adaptimmune or Adaptimmune Limited.   9.3 Subject to the statutory duties of the Texas State Attorney General, any indemnified Party shall: (a) notify the indemnifying Party in writing as soon as is reasonably possible after receipt of notice of any and all claims, lawsuits, and demands, or any action, suit, or proceeding giving rise to the right of indemnification; (b) permit the indemnifying Party to retain counsel to represent the named indemnified Party; and (c) permit the indemnifying Party to retain control of any such claims, lawsuits, and demands, including the right to make any settlement, except that the indemnifying Party shall not make any settlement or take any other action which would be deemed to confess wrongdoing by any of the indemnified Parties without the prior written consent of the applicable indemnified Party.         10. Subject Injury Medical Costs   10.1  Adaptimmune shall assume responsibility for reasonable medical expenses incurred by a Study subject for reasonable and necessary treatment if the Study subject experiences an illness, adverse event or injury that is a result of the Study Drug or any procedure required by the Protocol that the subject would not have undergone were it not for such Study subject's participation in the Study.  Adaptimmune shall not be responsible for expenses to the extent that they are due to pre-existing medical conditions, underlying disease, or the negligence or intentional misconduct or due to breach of this Agreement by MD Anderson or Principal Investigator. Adaptimmune shall have no obligation to make any payments for any Study patient that is not eligible for inclusion in any Protocol. Any payments for such medical expenses shall be subject to Adaptimmune receiving relevant documentation supporting the claim for such medical expenses.   11. Insurance   11.1 During the term of any Study Order under this Agreement, Adaptimmune Limited shall maintain in full force and effect insurance for its and Adaptimmune's liabilities arising from the Study with limits of not less than $*** per loss and $*** annual aggregate.

The alliance pairs MD Anderson's preclinical and clinical teams with Adaptimmune's scientists and proprietary SPEAR\u00ae (Specific Peptide Enhanced Affinity Receptor) T-cell technology platform, which enables Adaptimmune to identify targets expressed on solid and hematologic cancers and to develop affinity enhanced T-cell receptors (TCRs) with optimal potency and specificity against them.   The teams will collaborate in a number of areas including preclinical and clinical development of Adaptimmune's SPEAR T-cell therapies targeting MAGE-A10 and future clinical stage first and second generation SPEAR T-cell therapies such as MAGE-A4 across a number of cancers, including bladder, lung, ovarian, head and neck, melanoma, esophageal and gastric cancers. The alliance will also drive research and development of other new SPEAR TCR therapies to targets in other tumor types such as breast cancers and facilitate clinical study participation by MD Anderson in other Adaptimmune trials. Access to MD Anderson's tumor repository will guide further target selection and clinical trial design, while its cancer immunology cores and expertise in performing translational medicine studies may help optimize the efficacy and safety of SPEAR T-cell therapies.   \"At MD Anderson, we are focused on providing the best possible care for cancer patients, including implementing important new technologies and treatment modalities,\" said Elizabeth Mittendorf, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of Breast Surgical Oncology.   David Hong, M.D., associate professor of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics at MD Anderson added, \"It is our hope this alliance will allow us to address numerous solid tumors and augment the patient's immune system, directing it against tumors based on their specific molecular makeup.\"   \"We believe that this strategic alliance will provide a strong partnership for the development of multiple new first and subsequent generation SPEAR T-cell therapies against many intractable solid tumors in our near-term clinical programs,\" commented Rafael Amado, Adaptimmune's chief medical officer. \"It will also generate invaluable data from patient samples that will help us understand these therapies and design the next generation of studies. We are very proud to form this alliance with the outstanding team of cancer immunologists at MD Anderson, and are confident that together we can move these novel immunotherapeutic candidates forward for patients who are fighting a variety of cancers.\"   About MD Anderson   The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston ranks as one of the world's most respected centers focused on cancer patient care, research, education and prevention. The institution's sole mission is to end cancer for patients and their families around the world. MD Anderson is one of only 45 comprehensive cancer centers designated by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). MD Anderson is ranked No.1 for cancer care in U.S. News & World Report's \"Best Hospitals\" survey. It has ranked as one of the nation's top two hospitals since the survey began in 1990, and has ranked first for nine of the   46\n\n\n\n\n\n  past 10 years. MD Anderson receives a cancer center support grant from the NCI of the National Institutes of Health (P30 CA016672).   About Adaptimmune   Adaptimmune is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on novel cancer immunotherapy products based on its SPEAR\u00ae (Specific Peptide Enhanced Affinity Receptor) T-cell platform. Established in 2008, the company aims to utilize the body's own machinery - the T-cell - to target and destroy cancer cells by using engineered, increased affinity TCRs as a means of strengthening natural patient T-cell responses. Adaptimmune's lead program is a SPEAR T-cell therapy targeting the NY-ESO cancer antigen. Its NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy has demonstrated signs of efficacy and tolerability in Phase 1/2 trials in solid tumors and in hematologic cancer types, including synovial sarcoma and multiple myeloma. Adaptimmune has a strategic collaboration and licensing agreement with GlaxoSmithKline for the development and commercialization of the NY-ESO TCR program. In addition, Adaptimmune has a number of proprietary programs. These include SPEAR T-cell therapies targeting the MAGE-A10 and AFP cancer antigens, which both have open INDs, and a further SPEAR T-cell therapy targeting the MAGE-A4 cancer antigen that is in pre-clinical phase with IND acceptance targeted for 2017. The company has identified over 30 intracellular target peptides preferentially expressed in cancer cells and is currently progressing 12 through unpartnered research programs. Adaptimmune has over 250 employees and is located in Oxfordshire, U.K. and Philadelphia, USA.

Limitations to Patent Licenses.  Nothing contained in a Patent               --------------------------------                               License shall be construed as:\n\n    (a) requiring the filing of any application for a Patent or utility model,\n\n\n\n\n\nor the prosecution, maintenance or defense of any such application;\n\n    (b) the maintenance or defense of any Patent;\n\n    (c) a warranty or representation by Grantor, or admission by Grantee, as to the validity or scope of any Patent;\n\n    (d) a warranty or representation that any manufacture, sale, lease, use, or importation of a Licensed Product, or the provision of any Licensed Service, by Grantee shall be free from infringement of any intellectual property right of Grantor other than those Patents under which and to the extent to which licenses are in force under the Patent License;\n\n    (e) an agreement to bring or prosecute actions or suits against third parties for infringement;\n\n    (f) an obligation to provide any manufacturing or technical information or any support or technical assistance;\n\n    (g) conferring any right to use, in advertising, publicity or otherwise, any name, trade name or trademark, or any contraction, abbreviation or simulation thereof, except as expressly provided herein;\n\n    (h) conferring by implication, estoppel or otherwise upon Grantee any license or other right under any Patent or other intellectual property right, except the licenses and rights expressly granted herein; or\n\n                                       7\n\n      (i) an obligation upon grantor to make any determination as to the applicability of any Patent to any product, Licensed Product or Licensed Service of Grantee.\n\nSection 6.06 NTL Right to Cross-License.  The licenses granted hereunder do not              ---------------------------                                        include for the Grantee the right to grant sublicenses to any third party except as expressly provide in Section 6.03.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, NTL shall be entitled to sublicense the Entrust Patents to meet its obligations under its existing Patent cross license agreements.  For so long as ETI is an NTL Subsidiary, NTL shall also be entitled, as part of its continuing Patent cross licensing program, to sublicense Entrust Patents under new Patent cross license agreements provided that the rights granted in the Entrust Patents pursuant to any such new Patent cross license agreements do not materially exceed those rights customarily granted under NTL's existing Patent cross license agreements (as of the Effective Date) and ETI obtains the benefit of all Nortel Patents involved.\n\nSection 6.07. Excluded Patents.               -----------------\n\n(a) Assigned Patents.  It is recognized that Grantor may have entered into or     -----------------                                                             may hereafter enter into a contract with, or a subcontract directly for the     benefit of, a third party to undertake development work partially or     completely financed by such third party and that Grantor may be required     under such contract or subcontract (either unconditionally or by reason of     any action or inaction thereunder) to assign to such third party its rights     to grant, or may now or hereafter be restrained by such third party from     granting, licenses to Grantee under Patents arising out of such work or     covered by such contract or subcontract.  The resulting inability of Grantor     to grant the licenses purported to be granted by it under such Patents shall     not be considered to be a breach of the Patent License.  In such case, upon     request by the Grantee, Grantor shall make reasonable efforts to secure     rights and licenses for the Grantee from the third-party equivalent to those     provided in the Patent License.\n\n(b) Patents Subject to Exclusive Licenses.  ETI acknowledges that NTL may have     --------------------------------------                                         entered into exclusive license arrangements with other corporations or legal     entities.  The Patent License granted hereunder by NTL does not extend the     scope of any such exclusive licenses (including any which NTL is negotiating     as of the Effective Date).\n\nSection 6.08. Jointly Owned Patents.  If the grant by Grantor of licenses and               ----------------------                                          rights in accordance with the Patent License in respect of Patents made by its employees jointly with third parties is subject by contract or by operation of law to the consent of such third parties or their assignees, upon request of the Grantee, Grantor shall use reasonable efforts to either secure rights and licenses for the Grantee from such third-party equivalent to those provided in\n\n                                       8\n\n  the Patent License, or obtain consent from such third parties to grant rights and licenses equivalent to those provided in the Patent License; however, the inability of Grantor to secure such rights or to obtain such consent in spite of the use of reasonable efforts shall not be considered to be a breach of the Patent License.  Notwithstanding that such rights or such consent may be subject to the payment of a royalty or other consideration to any such third party as provided for in Section 6.09, and notwithstanding other conditions agreed with the third party, the grant of such licenses and rights shall otherwise be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Patent License.\n\nSection 6.09. Royalty Obligations.  Licenses and rights, the grant of which by\n\n\n\n\n\n              --------------------                                             Grantor or the exercise of which by Grantee would make Grantor liable to third parties for royalties or other payments, shall be granted only upon agreement in writing of the Grantee to pay an appropriate portion of such royalties or make such other payments.\n\nSection 6.10. Patent Information.  Each Party shall, upon written request from               -------------------                                              the other Party sufficiently identifying any Patent by country, number and date of issuance, inform such other Party of the extent to which any such Patent is available for licensing under the Patent License.  If the license or rights under any such Patent are restricted in scope, or are subject to payments according to Section 6.09, a statement of the nature of any such restrictions or payments shall, on request, be provided within a reasonable time.\n\nSection 6.11.  Duration of Cross Licenses.                ---------------------------\n\n(a) The Patent License shall commence on the Effective Date hereof (except as     provided in Section 6.12) and shall continue for the Patent License Term     unless terminated as provided in Article X or Section 6.06.  Notwithstanding     the expiration of the Patent License Term, the rights and licenses granted     hereunder shall continue for the entire terms that the Entrust Patents or     the NTL Patents, as the case may be, are in force or for that part of such     terms for which the Grantor has the right to grant such rights and licenses.     Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the Patent License     shall terminate immediately upon ETI ceasing to be a Subsidiary of NTL.\n\n(b) Subject to the other sections of this Article VI, any termination of the     licenses and rights granted to one Party and its Subsidiaries under the     Patent License shall not affect the licenses and rights granted to the other     Party and its Subsidiaries.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.11, the Patent     Licenses shall, for the patents owned or by a party, terminate as provided     for in Section 6.11(a) or ten years from the Effective Date, whichever is     later.\n\n                                       9\n\n  Section 6.12.

When a Subsidiary of ETI or NTL ceases to be a Subsidiary of such Party, any     license granted to such Subsidiary in or pursuant to the Patent License     shall terminate on the date that such Subsidiary ceases to be a Subsidiary.\n\nSection 6.12.  Restraint on Claims.  Each Grantor undertakes not to assert any                --------------------                                            claim for Patent infringement with respect to use and maintenance of Licensed Products against any end user, customer or distributor of Grantee, or any subsequent vendee, lessee, or transferee to the extent the Licensed Products have been acquired from Grantee after the Effective Date and are used for the purpose for which they predominantly have been made (without modification or amendment).\n\nSection 6.13. Patent License Limitations.  Neither Party makes any               --------------------------                           representations, extends any conditions or warranties of any kind or assumes any responsibility whatever with respect to the Patent Licenses other than the licenses, rights and representations expressly granted in this Article VI; in particular, unless the Parties or their Subsidiaries have expressly agreed otherwise, neither Grantor warrants that Licensed Products made, used, sold, disposed of, leased or licensed for use by Grantee, or Licensed Services provided by Grantee, do not infringe Patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.\n\n                                  ARTICLE VII                           COORDINATION OF CONTRACTING                           ---------------------------\n\nSection 7.01 Compliance with Nortel Policies.

HPS desires that SHPS provide, and SHPS is willing to provide, the Care Management Services to the Clients on behalf of HPS in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Accordingly, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth below, the parties agree as follows:\n\n                                   TERMS\n\n      1.       SERVICES PROVIDED; TERM AND TERMINATION\n\n               1.1 AGREEMENT TO OUTSOURCE CARE MANAGEMENT SERVICES. HPS agrees to outsource to SHPS, and hereby appoints SHPS as the exclusive provider of, Care Management Services to the Clients, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. SHPS shall provide the Care Management Services directly to the Clients in accordance with the terms of the Client Agreements. \"Care Management Services\" means the business of providing utilization review (which includes, but is not limited to, pre-admission certification, prior authorization, prospective length of stay approvals, second opinions, concurrent review and discharge planning), catastrophic medical case management, disease management and demand management (24 hours per day, 7 days per week) services to benefits payors and health providers, in all cases in accordance with the terms of the applicable Client Agreement.\n\n               1.2 TERM. The term of this Agreement will commence on January 1, 1998 (the \"Effective Date\") and will end on December 31, 1998. Unless either party gives the other at least ninety days' prior written notice that it has elected not to extend the term of this Agreement beyond December 31, 1998, the term of this Agreement will be automatically extended until December 31, 1999. Thereafter this Agreement will automatically be renewed for successive additional periods of one year, unless either party gives notice of cancellation on or before October 1 of any such year.\n\n               1.3 TERMINATION FOR CAUSE. In the event that either party materially or repeatedly defaults in the performance of any of its duties or obligations hereunder and does not substantially cure such default within thirty days after being given written notice specifying the default, or, with respect to those defaults which cannot reasonably be cured within thirty days, if the defaulting party fails to proceed promptly after being given such notice to commence curing the default and thereafter to reasonably proceed to cure the same, then the party not in default\n\n2\n\nmay, by giving written notice to the defaulting party, terminate this Agreement as of a date specified in such notice of termination.\n\n      2.       PAYMENTS\n\n               2.1 FEES FOR CURRENT HPS CLIENTS. For each month during the term of this Agreement, HPS will pay to SHPS an amount equal to (i) eighty-two and one-half percent (82.5%) of the first $500,000 of Care Management Revenues (as defined below) during such month plus (ii) eighty percent (80%) of Care Management Revenues during such month in excess of $500,000. HPS shall pay such amount to SHPS within fifteen days following the end of the applicable month. At the time of payment HPS shall submit to SHPS a schedule for the month of payment setting forth the calculation of fees payable under this Section 2.1 and Care Management Revenues by Client.\n\n               2.2 CALCULATION OF CARE MANAGEMENT REVENUES. \"Care Management Revenues\" means, with respect to any month during the term, the revenues collected by HPS from Clients (or new Clients, as applicable) for the Care Management Services. Monthly revenues for Care Management Services shall be calculated based on a per employee per month fee equal to: (i) the amount (as of the date of this Agreement) set forth in the applicable Client Agreement (including hourly medical case management fees); or (ii) if the Client Agreement does not include a per employee per month fee for Care Management Services, $2.00 (this amount shall apply to all individual and small group business). Prospectively, for new Clients, SHPS and HPS shall agree to the rate HPS will offer to such new Clients (including hourly medical case management fees).\n\n               2.3 ALLOCATION OF COSTS. SHPS shall pay to HPS its allocable portion (which portion shall approximate HPS' direct costs chargeable to the business function) of depreciation, information system services, rent and utilities for the use by SHPS of HPS facilities in connection with its delivery of Care Management Services to the Clients. SHPS shall also reimburse HPS for direct costs for postage and telecommunications incurred by HPS in connection with such use by SHPS of HPS facilities. For convenience, the parties\n\n\n\n\n\nacknowledge that HPS will deduct amounts owed by SHPS under this Section 2.3 from the fees described in Section 2.1 and reflect such deductions in the schedule prepared by HPS.\n\n               2.4 NEW CLIENTS. In the event that HPS (or one of its affiliates other than SHPS) enters into an agreement to provide Care Management Services with a client which is not a Client as of the date of this Agreement (a \"New Client\"), SHPS shall provide such Care Management Services to the New Client in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. HPS will pay to SHPS all Care Management Revenues collected from such New Client, and SHPS will pay a commission to HPS equal to five percent (5%) of such amount received by SHPS from HPS pursuant to this Section 2.4.

NPC shall          perform on NCB's behalf all of the administrative and bookkeeping          functions necessary to effect payment in such manner.\n\n               1.7 DUE DILIGENCE BY NCB; NPC'S STANDARDS.\n\n               (a) DUE DILIGENCE PRIOR TO EXECUTION OF AGREEMENT.

Schedule A attached hereto outlines the credit and financial          review procedures and standards currently used by NPC.

NPC shall          keep NCB's senior management advised of any material changes in the          credit and financial review procedures and standards and of any          material exceptions to such procedures and standards which may from          time to time be made with respect to particular Merchants. NPC shall          not make any such changes or exceptions until its management committee          has approved such changes or exceptions after carefully evaluating the          relative advantages and disadvantages expected to result from such          changes or exceptions. NPC also shall continue to advise senior          management officials of NCB on a timely basis with respect to any          substantial loss (meaning any loss of $1,000,000 or more with respect          to a single Merchant or $3,000,000 or more in the aggregate in any          twelve month period) incurred by NPC as a result of any financial          failures or fraud by its merchant customers. If NCB's senior management          officials reasonably determine from time to time that any changes are          needed in NPC's credit and financial review procedures and standards or          in the implementation thereof in order to avoid any significant          increase in NPC's losses from financial failures or fraud by its          merchant customers, then NCB shall so notify NPC in writing, and NPC          and NCB shall mutually agree upon, and NPC shall implement appropriate          changes.\n\n               (c) DUE DILIGENCE BY NCB FOR NPC PRICING STANDARDS. Senior          management officials of NPC have met with senior management officials          of NCB and have discussed with the NCB officials the pricing procedures          and standards used for Merchants as customers for Merchant Processing          Services. NPC shall keep NCB's senior management advised of any\n\n\n\n\n\n      material changes in its pricing procedures and standards and of any          material exceptions to such procedures and standards which may from          time to time be made with respect to particular Merchants. NPC shall          not make any such changes or exceptions until its management committee          has approved such changes or exceptions after carefully evaluating the          relative advantages and disadvantages expected to result from such          changes or exceptions. If NCB's senior management officials reasonably          determine from time to time that any changes are needed in NPC's          pricing procedures and standards or in the implementation thereof, then          NCB shall so notify NPC in writing, and NPC and NCB shall mutually          agree upon, and NPC shall implement appropriate changes.\n\n                 ARTICLE II - AUTHORITY OF JOINT OFFICERS                     ----------------------------------------\n\n               2.1 JOINT OFFICERS.

Each Joint Officer shall have authority to establish at NCB or any other mutually acceptable financial institution any deposit accounts on behalf of NCB as may be necessary to provide some or all of the Merchant Processing Services contemplated by this Agreement for such periods as NCB and NPC agree.

Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create any obligation on the part of NCB to loan or advance to NPC any amounts in connection with Merchant Processing Services for any period of time.\n\n                      ARTICLE IV - FEES AND EXPENSES                          ------------------------------\n\n               4.1 CHARGES TO MERCHANTS.

FORCE MAJEURE Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Parties shall be excused from the consequences of any breach of this Agreement if and to the extent that such breach was caused in whole or in part by a Force Majeure event, provided that (a) the affected Party shall not in any material way have caused or contributed to such Force Majeure event, (b) the Force Majeure event could not have been prevented by reasonable and ordinary precautions (as would be employed by a reasonably prudent person in the position of the affected party), and (c) the Force Majeure event could not reasonably have been circumvented by the affected Party by reasonable and ordinary commercial means, such as the use of alternate suppliers or subcontractors. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) the existence or occurrence of a Force Majeure event shall excuse a breach of this Agreement only for such period of time as the Force Majeure event remains in existence and only to the extent that such Force Majeure event has caused in whole or in part the breach of this Agreement;\n\n- 19 -\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) the existence of a Force Majeure event that has caused a breach of this Agreement shall not prevent a Party from asserting and acting upon a breach of this Agreement that has not been caused by a Force Majeure event; (c) If a Party is not or is not expected to be able to perform any material obligation under this Agreement due to a Force Majeure event for a period of [Redacted - Commercial Sensitive - Time Period] or more, the other Party may terminate this Agreement without liability.

M&I does however need to perform regular technical maintenance (e.g., NCP maintenance), CPU IPLs, DASD installs, IHS gens, etc.).  This type of maintenance is performed between 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. CST/CDT.  These activities may result in system downtime during this window.\n\n          C.   Processing Time.  M&I will process transactions in an average of 2.5 seconds for teller transactions (not to exceed six (6) seconds for five percent (5%) of all transactions per month)  and in an average of three point five (3.5) seconds (not to exceed seven (7) seconds for five percent (5%) of all transactions per month) for bank operations CRT transactions as measured over a calendar month, from the time the transaction is sent by the Customer's controller or gateway to the time the processed data is returned to the Customer's controller or gateway.  Should M&I not be able to perform in accordance with the Performance Standards because Customer failed to acquire network or equipment recommended by M&I, or such additional network or equipment as may be reasonably necessary based on the circumstances, M&I shall notify Customer in writing and Customer shall either acquire such network and/or equipment or accept the response time that is achieved.\n\n          D.

M&I may, at any time, withdraw any of the Services (other than the Core Services) upon providing ninety (90) days' prior written notice to Customer.  M&I may also terminate any of the Services immediately upon any final regulatory, legislative, or judicial\n\n\n\n\n\ndetermination that providing such Services is inconsistent with applicable law or regulation or upon imposition by any such authority of restrictions or conditions which would detract from the economic or other benefits to M&I or Customer to any element of the Services.  In the event a Service provided as part of the monthly Base Fee is terminated by M&I, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith an appropriate reduction in the monthly Base Fee.\n\n     10.3 Partial Termination by Customer.\n\n          A.

All programs (including ideas and know-how and concepts) developed by M&I are and shall remain M&I's sole property.  Any writing or work of authorship created by M&I in the course of performing the Services under this Agreement, even if paid for by Customer, shall be the property of M&I (\"Developed Software\").  M&I may make such Developed Software available to any of its other customers; provided, however, if Customer has paid for such Developed Software and M&I offers, as part of M&I's standard price list, a separate service resulting exclusively from such Developed Software, M&I will refund, or credit, to Customer a portion of any amounts paid for such Developed Software on terms and conditions agreed to by the parties prior to commencement of work on the Developed Software.\n\n11.  TERMINATION\n\n     11.1 For Convenience.  Customer may terminate this Agreement during the Term upon at least one (1) years' written notice to M&I, provided that Customer pays M&I an early termination fee (\"Termination for Convenience Fee\") in an amount equal to REDACTED of the Estimated Remaining Value.

Fifty percent of the Termination for Convenience Fee shall be paid to M&I within thirty (30) days following the date of Customer's notice and the remaining 50% shall be paid to M&I within thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Date of Termination.  In addition to the foregoing, Customer shall pay to M&I, any unamortized Conversion or other costs, reasonable Expenses in connection with the disposition of equipment, facilities and contracts related to M&I's performance of the Services on behalf of Customer.

In addition to the foregoing, Customer shall pay to M&I, reasonable Expenses in connection with the disposition of equipment, facilities and contracts related to M&I's performance of the Services on behalf of Customer.  The Termination for Cause Fee shall not be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 13.4.\n\n          B.   If Customer terminates this Agreement following an Event of Default on the part of M&I, Customer shall not be responsible for any termination fees or charges as a result thereof.\n\nREDACTED\n\n     11.4 Termination Assistance.  Commencing six (6) months prior to the expiration of the Term of this Agreement, or upon any termination of this Agreement for any reason, M&I shall provide Customer, at Customer's expense, all necessary assistance to allow the Services to continue without interruption or adverse affect to Customer and to facilitate the orderly transition of Services to Customer or its designee (\"Termination Assistance\").  At the written request of Customer, given at least 100 days prior to expiration of the Term of the Agreement, M&I shall continue to provide Customer all Services at the rates set forth in this Agreement, for a maximum period of six (6) months.  As part of the Termination Assistance, M&I shall assist Customer to develop a plan for the transition of all data processing services from M&I to Customer or its designee on a reasonable schedule developed by Customer.  Prior to providing any Termination Assistance, M&I shall deliver to Customer a good faith estimate of all such Expenses and charges including, without limitation, charges for custom programming services.  Customer understands and agrees that all Expenses and charges for Termination Assistance shall be computed in accordance with M&I's then-current rates for such products, materials and services.  Nothing contained herein shall obligate Customer to receive Termination Assistance from M&I.\n\n12.  EVENTS OF DEFAULT; REMEDIES\n\n\n\n\n\n     12.1 By M&I.

It shall be an Event of Default on the part of the Customer if: (i) Customer becomes insolvent, or a receiver of conservator shall be appointed with respect to the Customer; or (ii) Customer shall fail to pay any sum due M&I within the prescribed time period, and such failure continues for ten days after written notice thereof from M&I; or (iii) Customer shall fail to perform any of its other obligations under this Agreement which have a material adverse effect on M&I, and such failure is not cured within 30 days after written notice from M&I.\n\n     12.3 Remedies.  Following an Event of Default, the non-defaulting party shall have the right to and commence the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Article 15 or to terminate this Agreement and collect its Damages.\n\n13.  DAMAGES\n\n     13.1 Direct Damages.  Customer and M&I shall be liable to the other only for direct damages arising out of or relating to their respective performance or non-performance of obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that the following shall be considered direct damages for the purposes of this Agreement:\n\n          A.   Costs of recreating or reloading any of Customer's information that is lost or damaged;\n\n          B.

Neither Customer nor M&I shall be liable for, nor will the measure of any damages in any event include, any indirect, incidental, punitive, special or consequential damages or amounts for loss of income, profits or savings arising out of or relating to performance or non-performance under this Agreement.\n\n     13.3 Equitable Relief.

Customer acknowledges that M&I shall suffer a material adverse impact on its business if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 11.1 or 11.2(A) and that the resulting damages may not be susceptible of precise determination.  Customer acknowledges that the Termination for Convenience Fee and the Termination for Cause Fee are each a reasonable approximation of such damages and shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and not a penalty.\n\n14.  INSURANCE AND INDEMNITY\n\n     14.1 Insurance.\n\n          A.   Throughout the Term of this Agreement, M&I shall maintain at all times at its own cost and expense:\n\n               1.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnitee shall have the right to employ its own separate counsel in any such action, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnitee; provided, however (1) if the parties agree that it is advantageous to the defense for the indemnitee to employ its own counsel or (2) in the reasonable judgment of the indemnitee, based upon an opinion of counsel which shall be provided to the indemnifying party, representation of both indemnifying party and the indemnitee would be inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct due to actual or potential conflicts of interest between them, then reasonable fees and expenses of the indemnitee's counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party, provided that the indemnifying party approves such counsel.  Neither the indemnifying party nor any indemnitee shall be liable for any settlement of action or claim effected without its consent.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnitee shall retain, assume, or reassume sole control over all expenses relating to every aspect of the defense that it believes is not the subject of the indemnification provided for in this section.  Until both (a) the indemnitee receives notice from indemnifying party that it will defend, and (b) the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnitee may, at any time after ten (10) days from the date notice of claim is given to the indemnifying party by the indemnitee, resist or otherwise defend the claim or, after consultation with and consent of the indemnifying party, settle or otherwise compromise or pay the claim.  The indemnifying party shall pay all costs of indemnity arising out of or relating to that defense and any such settlement, compromise, or payment.  The indemnitee shall keep the indemnifying party fully apprised at all times as to the status of the defense.  Following indemnification as\n\n\n\n\n\nprovided in this Section, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated to all rights of the indemnitee with respect to the matters for which indemnification has been made.\n\n15.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n     15.1 Representatives of Parties.  All disputes arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall initially be referred to the Account Representatives (as defined in Section 18.1).  If the Account Representatives are unable to resolve the dispute within five (5) business days after referral of the matter to them, the managers of the Account Representatives shall attempt to resolve the dispute.  If, after five (5) days they are unable to resolve the dispute, senior executives of the parties shall attempt to resolve the dispute.  If, after give (5) days they are unable to resolve the dispute, the parties shall submit the dispute to the chief executive officers of the parties for resolution.\n\n     15.2 Continuity of Performance.

Customer shall remain the sole and exclusive owner of all Customer Data and other Confidential Information (as hereinafter defined), regardless of whether such data is maintained on magnetic tape, magnetic disk, or any other storage or processing device.  All such Customer Data and other Confidential Information shall, however, be subject to regulation and examination by the appropriate auditors and regulatory agencies to the same extent as if such information were on Customer's premises.  \"Customer Data\" means any and all data and information of any kind or nature submitted to M&I by Customer, or received by M&I on behalf of Customer, in connection with the Services.\n\n     17.2 M&I Systems.  Customer acknowledges that it has no rights in any software, systems, documentation, guidelines, procedures and similar related materials or any modifications thereof provided by M&I, except with respect to Customer's use of the same during the Term to process its data.        17.3 Confidential Information.  \"Confidential Information\" of a party\n\n\n\n\n\nshall mean all confidential or proprietary information and documentation of such party, whether or not marked as such, including without limitation with respect to Customer, all Customer Data.

Each party shall instruct its employees, agents, and contractors of its confidentiality obligations hereunder and not to attempt to circumvent any such security procedures and devices.  Each party's obligation under the preceding sentence may be satisfied by the use of its standard form of confidentiality agreement, if the same reasonably accomplishes the purposes here intended.  All such Confidential Information shall be distributed only to persons having a need to know such information to perform their duties in conjunction with this Agreement.\n\n     17.5 Security.  M&I shall be responsible for, and shall establish and maintain safeguards against, a disaster, loss or alteration of the Customer Data in the possession of M&I.  Such safeguard shall be no less rigorous than that M&I uses to protect its own data of a similar nature.\n\n18.  MANAGEMENT OF PROJECT\n\n     18.1 Account Representatives.  Each party shall cause an individual to be assigned to the position of Account Representative to devote time and effort to management of the Services under this Agreement.  Neither party shall reassign or replace its Account Representative during the first year of his or her assignment without the consent of the other party, except if such individual voluntarily resigns, is dismissed for cause, or is unable to work due to his or her death or disability.\n\n     18.2 Change Control Procedures.  On or prior to the Conversion Date, M&I shall deliver to Customer the Change Control Procedures to be used by M&I to perform the Services.  At a minimum, the Change Control Procedures shall provide for prior notice to Customer of changes which materially adversely effect the quality or timeliness of the Services, in which case such change shall be made only on a temporary basis.

Customer shall have the right to notify M&I of any requirements or changes in state law which affect the provision of the Services.  Thereafter, M&I shall schedule implementation of the changes prior to the deadline imposed by the regulatory or other governmental agency having jurisdiction for such change.

M&I shall implement such change at Customer's sole cost and expense (shared equitably among all of M&I's other service bureau customers who are affected by such change).\n\n\n\n\n\n          B.   Provided that such enactments or regulations do not prohibit M&I from performing the Services for Customer, M&I shall use commercially reasonable efforts to perform the Services regardless of changes in legislative enactments or regulatory requirements.  If such changes prevent M&I from performing its obligations under this Agreement, M&I shall, when appropriate, make commercially reasonable efforts to develop and implement a suitable work around until such time as M&I can perform its obligations under this Agreement without such work around.\n\n20.  DISASTER RECOVERY\n\n     20.1 Disaster Recovery Plan.

(the \"Agent\") as follows:\n\nSection 1. The Offering. The MHC, in accordance with the plan of conversion as adopted by the Boards of Directors of each of the Blue Hills Parties (the \"Plan\"), intends to convert from the current mutual holding company form of organization to a stock holding company form of organization (the \"Conversion\"). Pursuant to the Plan, the Holding Company will offer and sell up to 24,150,000 shares (subject to increase up to 27,772,500 shares) of its common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the \"Shares\"), in a subscription offering (the \"Subscription Offering\") to (1) depositors of the Bank with Qualifying Deposits (as defined in the Plan) as of February 28, 2013 (\"Eligible Account Holders\"), (2) the Bank's tax\u00ad qualified employee benefit plans, including the employee stock ownership plan established by the Bank (the \"ESOP\"), and (3) employees, officers, directors, trustees and corporators of the Bank, the Mid-Tier and the MHC who do not have a higher priority to purchase stock. Subject to the prior subscription rights of the above\u00adlisted parties, the Holding Company may offer for sale in a direct community offering (the \"Community Offering\" and when referred to together with or subsequent to the Subscription Offering, the \"Subscription and Community Offering\") the Shares not subscribed for or ordered in the Subscription Offering to members of the general public to whom a copy of the Prospectus (as hereinafter defined) is delivered with a preference given first to natural persons and trusts of natural persons residing in the local community as defined in the Plan, and thereafter to cover orders of other members of the general public. It is anticipated that Shares not subscribed for in the Subscription and Community Offering may be offered to certain members of the general public on a best efforts basis through a selected dealers agreement (the \"Syndicated Community Offering\") or to certain members of the general public in a firm commitment underwritten offering (the \"Underwritten Offering\") with the Agent acting as sole book\u00adrunning manager (the Underwritten Offering, Subscription Offering, Community Offering and Syndicated Community Offering are collectively referred to as the \"Offering\"). It is acknowledged that the purchase of Shares in the Offering is subject to the maximum and minimum purchase limitations as described in the Plan and that the Holding Company may reject, in whole or in part, any order received in the Community Offering or Syndicated Community Offering.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Holding Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"Commission\") a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333\u00ad194486) (the \"Registration Statement\"), containing a prospectus relating to the Subscription and Community Offering, for the registration of the Shares under the Securities Act of 1933 (the \"1933 Act\"), and has filed such amendments thereof and such amended prospectuses as may have been required to the date hereof. The term \"Registration Statement\" shall include all financial schedules and exhibits thereto, as amended, including post-effective amendments. The prospectus, as amended, on file with the Commission at the time the Registration Statement initially became effective is hereinafter called the \"Prospectus,\" except that if any prospectus is filed by the Holding Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the \"1933 Act Regulations\") differing from the prospectus on file at the time the Registration Statement initially became effective, the term \"Prospectus\" shall refer to the prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) from and after the time said prospectus is filed with the Commission.\n\nIn accordance with the Massachusetts General Laws and the rules and regulations governing the conversion of Massachusetts mutual holding companies to stock holding companies (including, without limitation, Chapter 167H of the Massachusetts General Laws and Chapter 33, Subpart D of the Code of Massachusetts Regulations), as from time to time amended or supplemented (the \"Massachusetts Regulations\"), the MHC has filed the Plan with the Massachusetts Division of Banks (the \"Division\") and has filed such amendments thereto and supplementary materials as may have been required to the date hereof (such application, as amended to date, if applicable, and as subsequently amended, if applicable, is hereinafter referred to as the \"Massachusetts Conversion Application\"), including copies of the MHC's Notice and Information Statement for a Special Meeting of its Corporators relating to the Conversion (the \"Information Statement\"), the Appraisal, and the Prospectus.\n\nIn addition, the Holding Company has filed with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the \"FRB\") an Application to Become a Bank Holding Company and/or Acquire an Additional Bank or Bank Holding Company on Form FR Y\u00ad3 (the \"Holding Company Application\") to become a bank holding company under Section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the \"BHCA\"), as in effect at the time and the FRB has approved the Holding Company Application. The Massachusetts Conversion Application and the Holding Company Application are collectively referred to herein as the \"Applications\".\n\nSection 2. Retention of Agent; Compensation; Sale and Delivery of the Shares. Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Blue Hills Parties hereby appoint the Agent as their exclusive financial advisor and conversion agent (i) to utilize its best efforts to solicit subscriptions for Shares and to advise and assist the Holding Company and the Bank with respect to the sale of the Shares in the Offering and (ii) to participate in the Offering in the areas of market making and in syndicate formation or to act as sole book-running manager in the Underwritten Offering (if necessary).\n\nOn the basis of the representations, warranties, and agreements herein contained, but subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Agent accepts such appointment and agrees to consult with and advise the Blue Hills Parties as to the matters set forth in the letter agreements, dated October 7, 2013, among the MHC, the Mid-Tier, the Bank and the Agent (a copy of each of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A and Exhibit B). It is acknowledged by the Blue Hills Parties that the Agent shall not be required to purchase any Shares in the Subscription Offering, Community Offering, and Syndicated Community Offering or be obligated to take any action which is inconsistent with all applicable laws, regulations, decisions or orders.\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nThe obligations of the Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate upon termination of the Offering, but in no event later than 45 days after the completion of the Subscription Offering, unless extended (the \"End Date\"). All fees or expenses due to the Agent but unpaid will be payable to the Agent in next day funds at the earlier of the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) or the End Date. In the event the Offering is extended beyond the End Date, the Blue Hills Parties and the Agent may agree to renew this Agreement under mutually acceptable terms.\n\nIn the event the Holding Company is unable to sell a minimum of 17,850,000 Shares within the period herein provided, this Agreement shall terminate and the Holding Company shall refund to any persons who have subscribed for any of the Shares the full amount which it may have received from them plus accrued interest, as set forth in the Prospectus; and none of the parties to this Agreement shall have any obligation to the other parties hereunder, except as set forth in this Section 2 and in Sections 7, 9 and 10 hereof. In the event the Offering is terminated for any reason not attributable to the action or inaction of the Agent, the Agent shall be paid the fees due to the date of such termination pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and (e) below.\n\nThe Agent shall receive the following compensation for its services hereunder:\n\n(a) A management fee of $50,000 payable in four installments of $12,500 on the first day of October 2013, December 2013, March 2014 and June 2014. Such fees shall be deemed to have been earned when due. Should the Offering be terminated for any reason not attributable to the action or inaction of Agent, Agent shall have earned and be entitled to be paid fees accruing through the stage at which point the termination occurred.\n\n(b) A Success Fee of 0.85% shall be paid based on the aggregate purchase price of the Shares sold in the Subscription Offering and the Community Offering excluding shares purchased by the Blue Hills Parties' officers, directors, trustees or employees (or members of their immediate family) plus any ESOP, tax-qualified or stock based compensation plans or similar plan created by the Blue Hills Parties for some or all of their directors or employees or by the foundation (or any shares contributed to the foundation). The Management Fee described in Section 2(a) above will be credited against the Success Fee paid pursuant to this paragraph.\n\n(c) If any of the Shares remain available after the Subscription Offering and Community Offering, at the request of the Holding Company, Agent will seek to form a syndicate of registered broker-dealers to assist in the sale of Shares on a best efforts basis, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a selected dealers agreement to be entered into between the Holding Company and Agent. Agent will endeavor to distribute the Shares among dealers in a fashion which best meets the distribution objectives of the Holding Company and the Plan. Agent will be paid a fee not to exceed 5.25% of the aggregate Purchase Price of the Shares sold in the Syndicated Community Offering. From this fee, Agent will pass onto selected broker-dealers, who assist in the Syndicated Community Offering, an amount competitive with gross underwriting discounts charged at such time for comparable amounts of stock sold at a comparable price per share in a similar market environment.

(ii) stating in effect that, on the basis of certain agreed upon procedures (but not an audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)) consisting of a reading of the latest available consolidated financial statements of the MHC prepared by the MHC, a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the Boards of Directors of each of the Blue Hills Parties and consultations with officers of the MHC responsible for financial and accounting matters, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that: (A) the audited consolidated financial statements and any unaudited interim financial statements included in the Prospectus are not in conformity with the 1933 Act, applicable accounting requirements of the FRB, the Division and the FDIC and GAAP applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Prospectus;

and (iii) stating that, in addition to the audit referred to in their opinion included in the Prospectus and the performance of the procedures referred to in clause (ii) of this subsection (i), they have compared with the general accounting records of the MHC, which are subject to the internal controls of the MHC, the accounting system and other data prepared by the MHC, directly from such accounting records, to the extent specified in such letter, such amounts and/or percentages set forth in the Prospectus as the Agent may reasonably request; and they have found such amounts and percentages to be in agreement therewith (subject to rounding).\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n(j) At the Closing Date, the Agent shall receive a letter dated the Closing Date, addressed to the Agent, confirming the statements made by Wolf & Co., P.C. in the letter delivered by it pursuant to subsection (i) of this Section 8, the \"specified date\" referred to in clause (ii) of subsection (i) to be a date specified in the letter required by this subsection (j) which for purposes of such letter shall not be more than three business days prior to the Closing Date.\n\n(k) At the Closing Date, the Holding Company shall receive a letter from RP Financial LC., dated the Closing Date (i) confirming that said firm is independent of the Blue Hills Parties and is experienced and expert in the area of corporate appraisals within the meaning of the Massachusetts Conversion Regulations, (ii) stating in effect that the Appraisal prepared by such firm complies in all material respects with 209 CMR 33.08(3)(a), and (iii) further stating that its opinion of the aggregate pro forma market value of the Holding Company including the Bank, as most recently updated, remains in effect.\n\n(l) At or prior to the Closing Date, the Agent shall receive: (i) a copy of the letter from the FRB approving the Holding Company Application;

Indemnification.\n\n(a) Each of the Blue Hills Parties jointly and severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent, its officers and directors, employees and agents, and each person, if any, who controls the Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act, against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage or expense whatsoever (including, but not limited to, settlement expenses), joint or several, that the Agent or any of them may suffer or to which the Agent and any such persons may become subject under all applicable federal or state laws or otherwise, and to promptly reimburse the Agent and any such persons upon written demand for any reasonable expense (including all reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by the Agent or any of them in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any actions, proceedings or claims (whether commenced or threatened) to the extent such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions: (i) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the General Disclosure Package, any Issuer-Represented Limited-Use Free Writing Prospectus, any Issuer-Represented General Free Writing Prospectus, preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Applications (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or any instrument or document executed by the Blue Hills Parties or based upon written information supplied by the Holding Company filed in any state or jurisdiction to register or qualify any or all of the Shares or to claim an exemption therefrom or provided to any state or jurisdiction to exempt the Blue Hills Parties as a broker-dealer or its officers, directors and employees as broker-dealers or agents, under the securities laws thereof (collectively, the \"Blue Sky Application\"), or any document, advertisement, oral statement or communication (\"Sales Information\") prepared, made or executed by or on behalf of the Blue Hills Parties with its consent and based upon written or oral information furnished by or on behalf of the Blue Hills Parties, whether or not filed in any jurisdiction, in order to qualify or register the Shares or to claim an exemption therefrom under the securities laws thereof; (ii) arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in any of the foregoing documents or information a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (iii) arise from any theory of liability whatsoever relating to or arising from or based upon the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the General Disclosure Package, any Issuer\u00adRepresented Limited\u00adUse Free Writing Prospectus, any Issuer-Represented General Free Writing Prospectus, the Applications (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information or other documentation distributed in connection with the Conversion; provided, however, that no indemnification is required under this paragraph (a) to the extent such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue material statement or alleged untrue material statement in, or material omission or alleged material omission from, the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the General Disclosure Package, any Issuer-Represented Limited-Use Free Writing Prospectus, any Issuer-Represented General Free Writing Prospectus, the Applications, any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Holding Company, by the Agent or its counsel regarding the Agent, and provided, that it is agreed and understood that the only information furnished in writing to the Holding Company, by the Agent regarding the Agent is set forth in the Prospectus in the first sentence of the second paragraph under the caption \"The Conversion; Plan of Distribution\u2014Marketing and Distribution; Compensation\"; and, provided further, that such indemnification shall be limited to the extent prohibited by the Commission, the FDIC, the Division and the FRB.\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) The Agent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Blue Hills Parties, their directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Holding Company or the Bank within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage or expense whatsoever (including but not limited to settlement expenses), joint or several, which they, or any of them, may suffer or to which they, or any of them may become subject under all applicable federal and state laws or otherwise, and to promptly reimburse the Blue Hills Parties, and any such persons upon written demand for any expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by them, or any of them, in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any actions, proceedings or claims (whether commenced or threatened) to the extent such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions: (i) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Applications (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information, (ii) are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in any of the foregoing documents a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iii) arise from any theory of liability whatsoever relating to or arising from or based upon the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Applications (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information or other documentation distributed in connection with the Offering; provided, however, that the Agent's obligations under this Section 9(b) shall exist only if and only to the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement was made in, or such material fact or alleged material fact was omitted from, the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Applications (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Holding Company or the Bank, by the Agent or its counsel regarding the Agent, and provided, that it is agreed and understood that the only information furnished in writing to the Holding Company or the Bank, by the Agent regarding the Agent is set forth in the Prospectus in the first sentence of the second paragraph under the caption \"The Conversion; Plan of Distribution\u00adMarketing and Distribution; Compensation.\"\n\n(c) Each indemnified party shall give prompt written notice to each indemnifying party of any action, proceeding, claim (whether commenced or threatened), or suit instituted against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have on account of this Section 9 or otherwise. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of such action. In addition, if it so elects within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, an indemnifying party, jointly with any other indemnifying parties receiving such notice, may assume defense of such action with counsel chosen by it and approved by the indemnified parties that are defendants in such action, unless such indemnified parties reasonably object to such assumption on the ground that there may be legal defenses available to them that are different from or in addition to those available to such indemnifying party. If an indemnifying party assumes the defense of such action, the indemnifying parties shall not be liable for any fees and expenses of counsel for the indemnified parties incurred thereafter in connection with such action, proceeding or claim, other than reasonable costs of investigation. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (and any local counsel that said firm may retain) for each indemnified party in connection with any one action, proceeding or claim or separate but similar or related actions, proceedings or claims in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.\n\nSection 10. Contribution. In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in Section 9 is due in accordance with its terms\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\nbut is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Blue Hills Parties or the Agent, the Blue Hills Parties and the Agent shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including any investigation, legal and other expenses incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding, but after deducting any contribution received by the Blue Hills Parties or the Agent from persons other than the other parties thereto, who may also be liable for contribution) in such proportion so that the Agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the fees paid to the Agent pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement (not including expenses) bears to the gross proceeds received by the Holding Company from the sale of the Shares in the Offering, and the Blue Hills Parties shall be responsible for the balance. If, however, the allocation provided above is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative fault of the Blue Hills Parties on the one hand and the Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, proceedings or claims in respect thereto), but also the relative benefits received by the Blue Hills Parties on the one hand and the Agent on the other from the Offering (before deducting expenses). The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Blue Hills Parties on the one hand or the Agent on the other and the parties' relative intent, good faith, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Blue Hills Parties and the Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10 were determined by pro-rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 10. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, proceedings or claims in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 10 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action, proceeding or claim. It is expressly agreed that the Agent shall not be liable for any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense or be required to contribute any amount pursuant to Section 9(b) or this Section 10 which in the aggregate exceeds the amount paid (excluding reimbursable expenses) to the Agent under this Agreement. It is understood that the above stated limitation on the Agent's liability is essential to the Agent and that the Agent would not have entered into this Agreement if such limitation had not been agreed to by the parties to this Agreement. No person found guilty of any fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not found guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Blue Hills Parties under this Section 10 and under Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Holding Company and the Agent may otherwise have.

Termination. The Agent may terminate this Agreement by giving the notice indicated below in Section 12 at any time after this Agreement becomes effective as follows:\n\n(a) If any domestic or international event or act or occurrence has materially disrupted the United States securities markets such as to make it, in the Agent's reasonable opinion,\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\nimpracticable to proceed with the offering of the Shares; or if trading on the NYSE shall have suspended (except that this shall not apply to the imposition of NYSE trading collars imposed on program trading); or if the United States shall have become involved in a war or major hostilities or escalation thereof; or if a general banking moratorium has been declared by a state or federal authority which has a material effect on the Blue Hills Parties on a consolidated basis; or if a moratorium in foreign exchange trading by major international banks or persons has been declared; or if there shall have been a material adverse change in the financial condition, results of operations or business of any of the Blue Hills Parties, or if any of the Blue Hills Parties shall have sustained a material or substantial loss by fire, flood, accident, hurricane, earthquake, theft, sabotage or other calamity or malicious act, whether or not said loss shall have been insured; or, if there shall have been a material adverse change in the financial condition, results of operations or business of the Blue Hills Parties taken as a whole.\n\n(b) In the event the Holding Company fails to sell the required minimum number of the Shares by the date when such sales must be completed, in accordance with the provisions of the Plan or as required by the Massachusetts Regulations and applicable law, this Agreement shall terminate upon refund by the Holding Company to each person who has subscribed for or ordered any of the Shares the full amount which it may have received from such person, together with interest as provided in the Prospectus, and no party to this Agreement shall have any obligation to the other hereunder, except as set forth in Sections 2(a), 2(e), 7, 9 and 10 hereof.\n\n(c) If any of the conditions specified in Section 8 shall not have been fulfilled when and as required by this Agreement, unless waived in writing, or by the Closing Date, this Agreement and all of the Agent's obligations hereunder may be cancelled by the Agent by notifying the Holding Company of such cancellation in writing or by electronic mail at any time at or prior to the Closing Date, and any such cancellation shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as otherwise provided in Sections 2(a), 2(e), 7, 9 and 10 hereof.\n\n(d) If the Agent elects to terminate this Agreement as provided in this Section, the Blue Hills Parties shall be notified promptly by telephone or electronic mail, confirmed by letter.\n\nAny of the Blue Hills Parties may terminate this Agreement in the event the Agent is in material breach of the representations and warranties or covenants contained in Sections 5 or 6(c) and such breach has not been cured within a reasonable time period after the Blue Hills Party has provided the Agent with notice of such breach.\n\nThis Agreement may also be terminated by mutual written consent of the parties hereto.\n\nSection 12.

With regard 4\n\nSource: GARRETT MOTION INC., 8-K, 10/1/2018\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nto the Honeywell Shared IP, the Parties seek to ensure that SpinCo has the freedom to use such Honeywell Shared IP in the future. Hence, as of the Distribution Date, Honeywell hereby grants, and agrees to cause the members of the Honeywell Group to hereby grant, to SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid, perpetual, sublicenseable (solely to Subsidiaries and suppliers for \"have-made\" purposes), worldwide license to use and exercise rights under the Honeywell Shared IP (excluding Trademarks, the Honeywell Content and the subject matter of any other Ancillary Agreement), said license being limited to use of a similar type, scope and extent as used in the SpinCo Business prior to the Distribution Date and the natural growth and development thereof.\n\n(b) Trademarks.

For a period of five (5) years after the Distribution Date, in the event any member of the SpinCo Group, in SpinCo's reasonable judgment, requires a license under any Honeywell IP in order to initiate and pursue any new technical projects not covered by the licenses granted in Section 3.01(a), the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to license such Honeywell IP to the applicable member of the SpinCo Group on commercially reasonable terms. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if the Parties cannot reach agreement with respect to the terms of a license to Honeywell IP pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the applicable member of the SpinCo Group shall be permitted to challenge the validity or enforceability of such Honeywell IP (it being understood that such challenge is the sole remedy available to SpinCo in the event Honeywell does not grant such license, without regard to whether Honeywell has negotiated in good faith).\n\nSection 3.02. Other Covenants.\n\n(a) Honeywell hereby acknowledges (on behalf of itself and each other member of the Honeywell Group) SpinCo's right, title and interest in and to the SpinCo IP. Honeywell agrees that it will not, and agrees to cause each member of the Honeywell Group not to, (i) initiate any Action against any member of the SpinCo Group or its Affiliates for infringement, misappropriation or other violation of any Honeywell IP, (ii) oppose, challenge, petition to cancel, contest or threaten in any way, or assist another party in opposing, challenging, petitioning to cancel, contesting or threatening in any way, any application or registration by SpinCo or its Affiliates or their respective licensees for any SpinCo IP, the use of which is consistent with the use of such SpinCo IP in connection with the SpinCo Business as of immediately prior to the Distribution Date, (iii) engage in any act, or purposefully omit to perform any act, that impairs or adversely affects the rights of SpinCo or any member of the SpinCo Group in and to any SpinCo IP or (iv) apply for any registration with respect to the SpinCo IP (including federal, state and national registrations), in each case of the foregoing clauses (i) - (iv) for a period of five (5) years after the Distribution Date, without the prior written consent of SpinCo, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 5\n\nSource: GARRETT MOTION INC., 8-K, 10/1/2018\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n(b) SpinCo shall be responsible for policing, protecting and enforcing its own Intellectual Property Rights. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Honeywell will promptly give notice to SpinCo of any actual or threatened, unauthorized use or infringement of the SpinCo IP of which it receives notice, in each case for a period of five (5) years after the Distribution Date.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.02, each member of the Honeywell Group shall be permitted to challenge the validity or enforceability of SpinCo IP, in each case solely in response to an Action initiated by a third party where failure to assert such challenge would reasonably be expected to materially prejudice any member of the Honeywell Group's defense to such Action; provided, that the applicable member(s) of the Honeywell Group shall use reasonable best efforts to provide SpinCo with reasonable written notice prior to initiating any such challenge.\n\n(d) All SpinCo Trade Secrets shall be in or shall be moved to the physical possession of the SpinCo Group in a tangible form (including all copies thereof and all notes, extracts or summaries based thereon) prior to the Distribution Date. At the specific written request of SpinCo, Honeywell shall destroy or shall have destroyed any form or copy of any SpinCo Trade Secrets specified by SpinCo in such written request that are in the possession of Honeywell or any members of the Honeywell Group and were not used in the Honeywell Business as of immediately prior to the Distribution, other than SpinCo Trade Secrets that were electronically preserved or recorded by an electronic backup system prior to the Distribution Date and remain within a secure, encrypted data backup system that is subject to industry practice defense, protection and access restriction measures.\n\nSection 3.03. Honeywell Content.\n\n(a) Notwithstanding Section 3.01, Honeywell hereby grants, and agrees to cause the members of the Honeywell Group to hereby grant, to SpinCo and the members of the SpinCo Group, for a period of ten (10) years after the Distribution Date (unless earlier terminated in accordance with Section 3.03(c)), a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid, non-sublicenseable, non-transferable, worldwide license to use and reproduce the Honeywell Content solely for the SpinCo Group's internal business purposes. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that SpinCo may distribute the Honeywell Content internally through SpinCo's intranet in the same form and manner that it was distributed on the Honeywell intranet immediately prior to the Distribution Date; provided, that the Honeywell Content may not be used for any purpose other than the SpinCo Group's internal business purposes and may not be shared with any third party without the prior written consent of Honeywell.\n\n(b) SpinCo shall, and shall cause each member of the SpinCo Group to, remove any Honeywell Trademarks or reference to the Honeywell Business appearing on any Honeywell Content as soon as reasonably practicable following the Distribution Date, but in no event later than one hundred and eighty (180) days after the Distribution Date.\n\n(c) Without limiting ARTICLE VIII, the license granted to the SpinCo Group in Section 3.03(a) shall automatically terminate in the event (i) that any member of the SpinCo Group assigns, transfers, licenses or otherwise conveys any rights in or to the Honeywell Content to any third party or (ii) of (x) the sale of all or substantially all of the ownership interests 6\n\nSource: GARRETT MOTION INC., 8-K, 10/1/2018\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nin, or the assets of, any member of the SpinCo Group in a single transaction or a series of related transactions to one or more third parties, (y) any direct or indirect acquisition, consolidation or merger of any member of the SpinCo Group by, with or into any third party or (z) any spin-off, public offering or other corporate reorganization or single transaction or series of related transactions in which direct or indirect control of any member of the SpinCo Group is transferred to one or more third parties, including by transferring an excess of fifty percent (50%) of such member of the SpinCo Group's voting power, shares or equity, through a merger, consolidation, tender offer or similar transaction to one or more third parties.\n\nARTICLE IV LICENSES AND COVENANTS FROM SPINCO TO HONEYWELL\n\nSection 4.01. License Grants.\n\n(a) General. The Parties acknowledge that through the course of a history of integrated operations Honeywell and the members of the Honeywell Groups have each obtained knowledge of and access to, or otherwise used, certain SpinCo IP, including Patents, Trade Secrets, copyrighted content, proprietary know-how, and other Intellectual Property Rights that are not otherwise governed expressly by the Separation Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or identified expressly in the schedules thereto (collectively, \"SpinCo Shared IP\"). With regard to the SpinCo Shared IP, the Parties seek to ensure that Honeywell has the freedom to use such SpinCo Shared IP in the future. Hence, as of the Distribution Date, SpinCo hereby grants, and agrees to cause the members of the SpinCo Group to hereby grant, to Honeywell and the members of the Honeywell Group a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid, perpetual, sublicenseable (solely to Subsidiaries and suppliers for \"have made\" purposes), worldwide license to use and exercise rights under the SpinCo Shared IP (excluding Trademarks and the subject matter of any other Ancillary Agreement), said license being limited to use of a similar type, scope and extent as used in the Honeywell Business prior to the Distribution Date and the natural growth and development thereof.\n\n(b) Additional Licenses. For a period of five (5) years following the Distribution Date, in the event any member of the Honeywell Group, in Honeywell's reasonable judgment, requires a license under any SpinCo IP in order to initiate and pursue any technical projects not covered by the licenses granted in Section 4.01(a), the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to license such SpinCo IP to the applicable member of the Honeywell Group on commercially reasonable terms. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if the Parties cannot reach agreement with respect to the terms of a license to SpinCo IP pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the applicable member of the Honeywell Group shall be permitted to challenge the validity or enforceability of such SpinCo IP (it being understood that such challenge is the sole remedy available to Honeywell in the event SpinCo does not grant such license, without regard to whether SpinCo has negotiated in good faith).\n\nSection 4.02. Other Covenants.\n\n(a) SpinCo hereby acknowledges (on behalf of itself and each other member of the SpinCo Group) Honeywell's right, title and interest in and to the Honeywell IP. SpinCo agrees that it will not, and agrees to cause each member of the SpinCo Group not to, (i) 7\n\nSource: GARRETT MOTION INC., 8-K, 10/1/2018\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\ninitiate any Action against any member of the Honeywell Group or its Affiliates for infringement, misappropriation or other violation of any SpinCo IP, (ii) oppose, challenge, petition to cancel, contest or threaten in any way, or assist another party in opposing, challenging, petitioning to cancel, contesting or threatening in any way, any application or registration by the Honeywell Group or its Affiliates or their respective licensees for any Honeywell IP, the use of which is consistent with the use of such Honeywell IP in connection with the Honeywell Business as of immediately prior to the Distribution Date, (iii) engage in any act, or purposefully omit to perform any act, that impairs or adversely affects the rights of Honeywell or any member of the Honeywell Group in and to any Honeywell IP or (iv) apply for any registration with respect to the Honeywell IP (including federal, state and national registrations), in each case of the foregoing clauses (i) - (iv) for a period of five (5) years after the Distribution Date, without the prior written consent of Honeywell, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.\n\n(b) Honeywell shall be responsible for policing, protecting and enforcing its own Intellectual Property Rights. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SpinCo will promptly give notice to Honeywell of any actual or threatened, unauthorized use or infringement of the Honeywell IP of which it receives notice, in each case for a period of five (5) years after the Distribution Date.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.02, each member of the SpinCo Group shall be permitted to challenge the validity or enforceability of Honeywell IP, in each case solely in response to an Action initiated by a third party where failure to assert such challenge would reasonably be expected to materially any member of the SpinCo Group's defense to such Action; provided, that the applicable member(s) of the SpinCo Group shall use reasonable best efforts to provide Honeywell with reasonable written notice prior to initiating any such challenge.\n\n(d) All Honeywell Trade Secrets shall be in or shall be moved to the physical possession of the Honeywell Group in a tangible form (including all copies thereof and all notes, extracts or summaries based thereon) prior to the Distribution Date. At the specific written request of Honeywell, SpinCo shall destroy or shall have destroyed any form or copy of Honeywell Trade Secrets specified in such written request by Honeywell that are in the possession of SpinCo or any members of the SpinCo Group and were not used in the SpinCo Business as of immediately prior to the Distribution, other than Honeywell Trade Secrets that were electronically preserved or recorded by an electronic backup system prior to the Distribution Date and remain within a secure, encrypted data backup system that is subject to industry practice defense, protection and access restriction measures.\n\nARTICLE V ADDITIONAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RELATED MATTERS\n\nSection 5.01.

All Co-Branded Pages shall link back to theglobe Site as specified by theglobe.\n\n     2.8  User Relations.

If requested by theglobe and if Boxlot captures relevant information, Boxlot shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with theglobe to implement ways for theglobe to capture User information to the extent that such information would change the relevant information in theglobe's databases.\n\n     2.10  Promotions.

Unless mutually agreed otherwise, Boxlot Banners shall link to the Co-Branded Pages.  theglobe may request that Boxlot Banners be co-branded with theglobe Marks, in which case the parties shall work together to develop a mutually acceptable implementation.  theglobe may approve or reject any Boxlot Banner in its sole discretion.  theglobe shall use commercially reasonable efforts not to run banners on the Co-Branded Pages for the companies enumerated on Exhibit C.

The Mark owner may terminate the foregoing trademark license if, in its reasonable discretion, the licensee's use of the Marks tarnishes, blurs or dilutes the quality associated with the Marks or the associated goodwill and such problem is not cured within 10 days of notice of breach; alternatively, instead of terminating the license in total, the owner may specify that certain licensee uses may not contain the Marks.  Title to and ownership of the owner's Marks shall remain with the owner.  The licensee shall use the Marks exactly in the form provided and in conformance with any trademark usage policies.  The licensee shall not take any action inconsistent with the owner's ownership of the Marks, and any benefits accruing from use of such Marks shall automatically vest in the owner.  The licensee shall not form any combination marks with the other party's Marks other than the Domain Name (if applicable).

USER DATA.\n\n     5.1  Rights/Restrictions.  Except as specified in this section, each party may freely use and disclose any information (both individual and aggregated) about Users (\"User Data\").  Neither party shall disclose any User Data in any manner that permits the User Data to be associated with the other party or permits the targeting of Users on the basis of their status as Users (in theglobe's case) or theglobe users (in Boxlot's case), nor shall a party use the User Data to target Users on the basis of their status as Users (in theglobe's case) or theglobe users (in Boxlot's case).  However, either party may disclose User Data if it is aggregated (in a non-associatable way) with data from multiple online properties.  Each party shall use and disclose User Data only in accordance with the privacy policy under which it was collected.\n\n                                       5\n\n       5.2  Delivery to theglobe.

A party obligated to make payments hereunder shall keep for 3 years proper records and books of account relating to the computation of such payments.  Once every 12 months, the party receiving payment or its designee may inspect such records to verify reports.  Any such inspection will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the inspected party's business activities.  The inspected party shall immediately make any overdue payments disclosed by the audit plus applicable interest.  Such inspection shall be at the inspecting party's expense; however, if the audit reveals overdue payments in excess of 5% of the payments owed to date, the inspected party shall immediately pay the cost of such audit, and the inspecting party may conduct another audit during the same 12 month period.\n\n7.  REPORTS.\n\n     7.1  By theglobe.  Within 30 days following the end of each month, theglobe shall provide Boxlot with its standard reports regarding theglobe's promotions hereunder and reports on the computation of Net Revenues.\n\n     7.2  By Boxlot.

The report shall be broken down into at least the following categories: the User's unique UserID\n\n                                       6\n\n  number assigned by theglobe, the action being logged (bid, purchase, list, sale), the date and time of the event, and the topic/category in which the event occurred. Such reports shall be provided to theglobe on at least a monthly basis in an electronic format that is easily decoded in an automated manner for import into theglobe's statistics database, and the file shall be a  delimited text file with each line corresponding to an event and including the information outlined above.\n\n8.

In addition, by providing written notice, theglobe may immediately terminate this Agreement, or at its option immediately suspend its promotion and other efforts hereunder, in the case of Boxlot's breach of Section 12.1  [Compliance with Laws].\n\n     8.3  Termination for Change of Control.  By providing written notice, theglobe may terminate this Agreement in its sole discretion if one of the following companies (or their subsidiaries) does an \"Ownership Change Event\": Lycos, Yahoo (including GeoCities, which shall be included even if their proposed merger does not occur), Xoom, Fortune City, Excite, Go Network (including Disney and Infoseek), Snap! (including NBC) and AOL.  An \"Ownership Change Event\" means: (x) the acquisition of 50% or more of Boxlot's equity or voting interests; (y) a merger or consolidation of Boxlot; or (z) the sale, exchange or transfer of all or substantially all of Boxlot's assets related to the Service.\n\n     8.4  Termination for Changes.  By providing written notice, theglobe may terminate this Agreement in its sole discretion if: (a) Boxlot's business model changes such that the Service is no longer Boxlot's primary line of business, or (b) at the one year anniversary of the Launch Date, the Service is significantly inferior to the comparable services being offered by the market leaders in the person to person auction space.\n\n     8.5  Termination for Failure to Grow.

Thus, in the event that this Agreement terminates under Section 8.2  [Termination for Failure to Perform] due to Boxlot's failure to perform (excluding the cross-reference to Section 12.7  [Force Majeure]) prior to the end of the applicable year, Boxlot shall immediately pay to theglobe the amount necessary to pay the total year's placement fee for that year.  Boxlot waives any right to assert that the foregoing fee is a liquidated damage or a penalty.\n\n9.  NO WARRANTIES.

In addition, theglobe shall indemnify Boxlot against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which Boxlot may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from the Page Templates or theglobe Marks.

The foregoing obligations are conditioned on the Indemnified Party: (i) giving the Indemnifying Party notice of the relevant claim, (ii) cooperating with the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, in the defense of such claim, and (iii) giving the Indemnifying Party the right to control the defense and settlement of any such claim, except that the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement that affects the Indemnified Party's rights or interest without the Indemnified Party's prior written approval.  The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense at its expense.\n\n11.  LIABILITY LIMITS.  NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR LOST PROFITS OR SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (HOWEVER ARISING, INCLUDING\n\nSource: THEGLOBE COM INC, S-1/A, 5/3/1999\n\n\n\n\n\nNEGLIGENCE) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF THE PARTIES ARE AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEXCEPT IN THE EVENT OF A CLAIM UNDER SECTION 10 OR FAILURE TO PAY UNDER SECTION 6, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE\n\n                                       8\n\n  OTHER PARTY IN AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN THE AMOUNT BOXLOT ACTUALLY PAYS TO THEGLOBE HEREUNDER.\n\n12.  GENERAL.\n\n     12.1  Compliance with Laws. At its own expense, Boxlot shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding providing and operating the Service.

This Agreement will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to conflict of laws principles. Both parties submit to personal jurisdiction in New York and further agree that any cause of action arising under this Agreement shall be brought in a court in New York City, NY.\n\n     12.3  Publicity. Prior to the release of any press releases or other similar promotional materials related to this Agreement, the releasing party shall submit a written request for approval to the other party with a copy of the materials to be released, which request shall be made no less than 3 business days prior to the requested release date.

Neither party shall make any warranties or representations on behalf of the other party.\n\n     12.5  Assignment.  Neither party may assign its rights or delegate its duties hereunder (except to an affiliated company, or to a successor in interest in the event of a merger, sale of assets of the business to which this Agreement is related, or consolidation) without the other party's prior written consent, and any purported attempt to do so is null and void.\n\n     12.6  Severability; Headings.  If any provision herein is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions will continue in full force without being impaired or invalidated in any way.  The parties agree to replace any invalid provision with a valid provision that most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the invalid provision.  Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section.\n\n     12.7  Force Majeure.  Except as otherwise provided, if performance hereunder (other than payment) is interfered with by any condition beyond a party's reasonable control, the affected party, upon giving prompt notice to the other party, shall be excused from such performance to\n\n                                       9\n\n  the extent of such condition.

In the case of Boxlot's performance, a Boxlot force majeure includes theglobe's failure to perform its obligations described in this Agreement or an outage that affects the entire Internet in the United States; however, in no event shall a failure of any Boxlot supplier or vendor be deemed a Boxlot force majeure.\n\n     12.8  Notice.

This Agreement may be changed only by a writing signed by both parties.  The waiver of a breach of any provision of this Agreement will not operate or be interpreted as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.\n\n     12.10  Equity Stake.  Boxlot shall grant to theglobe, pursuant to industry- standard terms negotiated between the parties in good faith, immediately vested options to purchase shares of common stock equal to up to 4% of Boxlot's fully diluted capital stock (in accordance with the chart below).

The only login or registration that should be required to access the Service or the Co-Branded Pages is theglobe Site's login or registration.  Because Boxlot hosts the Service and the Co-Branded Pages, theglobe will pass to Boxlot information about each User accessing the Service or the Co-Branded Pages as described below:\n\n .    Accounts will be created for each User via a one-time \"welcome\" page      (hosted by theglobe) when the User tries to access the portion of the      Service requiring such registration for the first time.\n\n .    The \"welcome\" page will include registration fields for any information      about the User needed to use the Service but not currently in theglobe's      database.\n\n .    The \"welcome\" page will include a \"Privacy Policy\" informing the User that      their data is being passed to a third party (Boxlot) in order to use the      Services.\n\n .    Any additional required User information is collected and entered into      theglobe's database. Then, the required User information is sent to Boxlot      all at once to create the new account. theglobe will include the User's      \"username\" and \"UserID#\" in the data passed to Boxlot.\n\nAdditional notes on account creation:\n\n .    The User will only see the \"Welcome\" page until they consent to the privacy      policy and enter any required information. This page will not appear after      the User completes the initial account creation process.\n\n .    Account information stored on Boxlot's servers in connection to the Service      will need to be kept in parity with theglobe. To do so, the parties shall      work together to implement a mechanism for updating information on Boxlot's      servers when User information changes on theglobe Site.\n\n .    The technology used to pass the data to Boxlot for account creation and      ongoing account updates will be determined jointly by Boxlot and theglobe.\n\n .    The UserID# theglobe passes to Boxlot during account creation will be      stored by Boxlot in association with each User. This UserID# is necessary      to link individual user reporting and individual account updates between      Boxlot and theglobe on an ongoing basis.\n\n                                       18\n\nSource: THEGLOBE COM INC, S-1/A, 5/3/1999"}]}, {"title": "EmbarkComInc_19991008_S-1A_EX-10.10_6487661_EX-10.10_Co-Branding Agreement", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "CO-BRANDING AGREEMENT", "answer_start": 2591}], "id": "EmbarkComInc_19991008_S-1A_EX-10.10_6487661_EX-10.10_Co-Branding Agreement__Document Name", "question": "The name of the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "Sponsor", "answer_start": 637}, {"text": "United Airlines, Inc.", "answer_start": 494}, {"text": "Snap", "answer_start": 346}, {"text": "Snap Technologies, Inc.", "answer_start": 346}], "id": "EmbarkComInc_19991008_S-1A_EX-10.10_6487661_EX-10.10_Co-Branding Agreement__Parties", "question": "The two or more parties who signed the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "June 8, 1999", "answer_start": 309}], "id": "EmbarkComInc_19991008_S-1A_EX-10.10_6487661_EX-10.10_Co-Branding Agreement__Agreement Date", "question": "The date of the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "The Term shall commence on the date of this Agreement and, unless earlier terminated or extended as provided below, shall end as of December 31, 2000.", "answer_start": 12267}], "id": "EmbarkComInc_19991008_S-1A_EX-10.10_6487661_EX-10.10_Co-Branding Agreement__Effective Date", "question": "The date when the contract is effective\u00a0", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "The Term shall commence on the date of this Agreement and, unless earlier terminated or extended as provided below, shall end as of December 31, 2000.", "answer_start": 12267}], "id": "EmbarkComInc_19991008_S-1A_EX-10.10_6487661_EX-10.10_Co-Branding Agreement__Expiration Date", "question": "On what date will the contract's initial term expire?", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [], "id": "EmbarkComInc_19991008_S-1A_EX-10.10_6487661_EX-10.10_Co-Branding Agreement__Renewal Term", "question": "What is the renewal term after the initial term expires?

During the Term, and for a period of five (5) years thereafter, the receiving party will not disclose to others or use for any purpose of its own, other than in performance of this Agreement, any Confidential Information of the other party. Each party shall take, at a minimum, measures consistent with those taken to protect its own similar types of Confidential Information (and in any event, at least reasonable measures) to protect the other's Confidential Information against disclosures prohibited by this Agreement. Each party acknowledges that its breach of the provisions of this Section 8.1  [CONFIDENTIALITY] will result in immediate and irreparable harm to the other and that money damages alone would be inadequate to compensate such party. Therefore, in the event of a breach of this Section 8.1  [CONFIDENTIALITY] by either party the other party may, in addition to other remedies, immediately obtain and enforce injunctive relief prohibiting the breach or threatened breach or compelling specific performance. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the restrictions set forth in this Section 8.1  [CONFIDENTIALITY] shall not apply to any information that: (i) is in or enters the public domain through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) is disclosed to the receiving party by a third party legally entitled to make such disclosure; (iii) is independently developed by the receiving party without reference to any Confidential Information of the other party; or (iv) is required to be disclosed by applicable law, regulation or order of any governmental authority; provided, that in such event, the receiving party shall provide the disclosing party with prior notice that is reasonable in the circumstances of such disclosure and shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the disclosing party to minimize the extent and scope of such disclosure.\n\n      8.2   INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS.

Each of the MG Capital Parties and the Company are referred to herein as a \"Party\" and collectively, as the \"Parties.\" RECITALS WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, the MG Capital Parties may be deemed to beneficially own 2,703,537 shares of the Company's common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the \"Common Stock\"), which represents approximately 5.8% of the Common Stock issued and outstanding on the date hereof; WHEREAS, in consideration of the agreements and obligations of the Company, as set forth in this Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, the MG Capital Parties are agreeing (i) to irrevocably withdraw the notice of stockholder nomination of individuals for election as directors of the Company at the Company's 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the \"2020 Annual Meeting\") submitted to the Company on February 13, 2020 (the \"Nomination Notice\"), and any related materials or notices submitted to the Company in connection therewith and (ii) to terminate its solicitation of proxies in connection with the 2020 Annual Meeting; WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, the Company and the MG Capital Parties have determined that it is in their respective best interests to come to an agreement to modify the composition of the Company's board of directors (the \"Board\") and as to certain other matters, as provided herein; and WHEREAS, the Board and the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board have selected their 2020 Director Slate (as defined herein) for the 2020 Annual Meeting. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows: 1. Board of Directors. (a) Appointments. Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Board and its committees shall take such actions (with such actions deemed to have to occurred substantially simultaneously) as are necessary (i) to increase the size of the Board from six (6) to ten (10) Directors, and (ii) to appoint each of Kenneth S. Courtis and Michael Gorzynski (the \"MG Capital Designees\") and (iii) to appoint each of Avram A. Glazer and Shelly Lombard (together with the MG Capital Designees, the \"New Directors\") to the Board. (b) Board Size. From the date of this Agreement through the completion of the 2020 Annual Meeting, the Board will not increase the size of the Board above ten (10) directors without the unanimous approval of the Board. From the completion of the Company's 2020 Annual Meeting through the end of the Standstill Period (as hereinafter defined), the Board will not increase the size of the Board above seven (7) directors without the unanimous approval of the Board. (c) Board Chairman Succession. Consistent with the actions previously taken by the Board and the Glazer Agreement, and as of the date hereof, Mr. Glazer will be appointed as Chairman of the Board, succeeding Mr. Gfeller, who is being replaced as Chairman of the Board effective as of the date hereof.\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) New Director Information. As a condition to the New Directors' appointment to the Board and any subsequent nomination for election as a director at any future Company annual meeting of stockholders, he or she must provide any information required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filing under applicable law, stock exchange rules or listing standards. (e) Date of the 2020 Annual Meeting. The Company agrees that it shall hold the 2020 Annual Meeting no later than July 8, 2020 and shall not cause or permit any delay, postponement or adjournment thereof, except for any adjournment solely due to a lack of quorum under the Company's Fourth Amended and Restated By-Laws (the \"By-Laws\"). (f) Slate of Directors for the 2020 Annual Meeting. (i) The Company agrees that, in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Board shall take such actions as are necessary to (i) reduce the size of the Board from ten (10) to seven (7) Directors, effective as of the 2020 Annual Meeting, and (ii) nominate each of the New Directors and Wayne Barr, Jr., Warren H. Gfeller and Philip A. Falcone (collectively, the \"2020 Director Slate\") for election to the Board at the 2020 Annual Meeting for a term expiring at the Company's 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the \"2021 Annual Meeting\"). The Board, based on the information provided to it, has determined that each member of the 2020 Director Slate would (i) qualify as an \"independent director\" under the applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") and (ii) satisfy the guidelines and policies with respect to service on the Board applicable to all non- management directors (other than Mr. Falcone). The Company agrees that, provided that each member of the 2020 Director Slate is able and willing to serve on the Board, (i) the Board will unanimously recommend that the stockholders of the Company vote to elect each member of the 2020 Director Slate as a director of the Company at the 2020 Annual Meeting, (ii) the Company will use its reasonable best efforts (which will include the solicitation of proxies) to obtain the election of the 2020 Director Slate at the 2020 Annual Meeting and (iii) the Company will use its best efforts to resist, discourage and defend against any attempt, solicitation or action by any stockholder of the Company to remove any member of the 2020 Director Slate prior to the 2021 Annual Meeting. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company will be required to use no less than the same level of efforts and to provide no less than the same level of support as was provided for its director nominees at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Any of the Company's current directors that is not standing for election at the 2020 Annual Meeting shall receive the full amount of his or her quarterly compensation for serving as non-management directors during the second quarter of 2020 (including any quarterly fee awarded and vesting of any and all equity awards for serving on, or serving as the Chair of, any committee of the Board). (g) Company Policies and Indemnification. (i) The Parties acknowledge that each of the MG Capital Designees and each other member of the 2020 Director Slate will be governed by the same protections and obligations as other non-employee directors of the Company, including, without limitation, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, related party transactions, fiduciary duties, codes of conduct, trading and disclosure policies, and other governance guidelines and policies of the Company (collectively, \"Company Policies\"), and shall have the same rights and benefits as other non-employee directors of the Company, including without limitation with respect to insurance, indemnification, compensation and fees. (ii) The Parties acknowledge that to the extent they have not already done so, within three (3) business days of the date hereof, the Company shall enter into an indemnification agreement with each of the New Directors in the form attached as Exhibit 10.20 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, previously filed with the SEC on March 16, 2020. 2. Additional Agreements.

(b) The MG Capital Parties, on behalf of themselves and their Affiliates and Associates, shall irrevocably withdraw their Nomination Notice and any related materials or notices submitted to the Company in connection therewith and shall agree to terminate any solicitation of proxies in connection with the 2020 Annual Meeting.\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) The MG Capital Parties hereby agree to appear in person (including via permitted remote or virtual attendance) or by proxy at any annual or special meeting of the Company's stockholders held during the Standstill Period, and agree that they shall not participate or vote in any solicitation of written consents of the Company's stockholders during the Standstill Period (unless expressly requested to do so by the Board), and that they shall vote all shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the MG Capital Parties at such meeting or in such consent solicitation, (A) in favor of all directors nominated by the Board for election and against the removal of any member of the Board, (B) in accordance with the Board's recommendation with respect to any \"say-on-pay\" proposal and (C) in accordance with the Board's recommendation with respect to any other Company proposal or stockholder proposal or nomination presented at such meeting or solicitation of consents; provided, however, that in the event that both Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (\"ISS\") and Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (\"Glass Lewis\") recommend otherwise with respect to the Company's \"say-on-pay\" proposal presented at an annual or special meeting held during the Standstill Period, the MG Capital Parties shall be permitted to vote in accordance with the recommendation of ISS and Glass Lewis. (d) The MG Capital Parties agree that the Board or any committee thereof, solely to fulfill the discharge of its fiduciary duties upon the advice of its legal counsel, may recuse either of Messrs. Courtis or Gorzynski by majority vote of the members of the Board (but excluding the applicable director), from the portion of any Board or committee meeting at which the Board or any such committee is evaluating and/or taking action with respect to and after the right of the recused director to be present prior to recusal (A) the exercise of any of the Company's rights or enforcement of any of the obligations under this Agreement, and (B) any transaction proposed by, or with, the MG Capital Parties, their Affiliates or Associates, as long as all other similarly situated directors are similarly recused.

Courtis or Gorznyski any material distributed to the directors to the extent directly relating to the subject of that recusal. 3. Standstill Provisions.

Such important factors include, without limitation, issues related to the restatement of our financial statements; the fact that we have historically identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and any inability to remediate future material weaknesses; capital market conditions, including the ability of HC2 and its subsidiaries to raise capital; the ability of HC2's subsidiaries and portfolio companies to generate sufficient net income and cash flows to make upstream cash distributions; volatility in the trading price of HC2's common stock; the ability of HC2 and its subsidiaries and portfolio companies to identify any suitable future acquisition or disposition opportunities; our ability to realize efficiencies, cost savings, income and margin improvements, growth, economies of scale and other anticipated benefits of strategic transactions; difficulties related to the integration of financial reporting of acquired or target businesses; difficulties completing pending and future acquisitions and dispositions; activities by activist stockholders, including a proxy contest, consent solicitation or any unsolicited takeover proposal; effects of litigation, indemnification claims and other contingent liabilities; changes in regulations and tax laws; the risks and uncertainties associated with, and resulting from, the COVID-19 pandemic; and risks that may affect the performance of the operating subsidiaries and portfolio companies of the Company.

Monsanto also acknowledges its obligations pursuant to Section 6.13(b) hereof.\n\n(b) The Agent is exclusively distributing and managing the sale of the Roundup Pro SKU in Lawn and Garden Channels in the United States. The parties acknowledge that the Agent purchases the Roundup Pro SKU from Monsanto (or a successor entity which holds the rights to manufacture, sell or commercialize the Roundup Pro SKU) for the Agent's own account in its capacity as a distributor and not as a marketing agent, and the sales resulting from such Roundup\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\nPro SKU shall not be included in the Program Sales Revenues hereunder. In the event that the Agent is terminated as an exclusive distributor of the Roundup Pro SKU by Monsanto (or by a successor entity which holds the rights to manufacture, sell or commercialize the Roundup Pro SKU), any subsequent sales of the Roundup Pro SKU by parties other than Agent in the Lawn and Garden Channels in the United States will be subject to the provisions of Section 3.8(c) below.\n\n(c) Except to the extent provided in Section 3.8(b) above, on and after the Effective Date, Monsanto shall use its reasonable efforts to ensure that Roundup Ag Products are not sold, directly or indirectly, through Lawn and Garden Channels to consumers in the Lawn and Garden Market in the Included Markets. In the event that in the normal course of business the Agent determines based on satisfactory evidence that a material amount of additional Roundup Ag Products, above Program Year 2016 sales levels (such amount, the \"Historical Threshold\"), are being sold directly by Monsanto (or directly by any successor entity which holds the rights to manufacture, sell or commercialize the Roundup Pro SKU) through Lawn and Garden Channels in the Included Markets, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to include, subject to the principles set forth in Section 3.8(d), an appropriate percentage of such incremental sales that exceed the Historical Threshold to reflect such Lawn and Garden Use within the definition of Program Sales Revenues so that the Agent receives credit therefor for purposes of calculating the Agent's Commission, or such other compensation as required to fully compensate the Agent for lost Commission as a result of such sales of Roundup Ag Products above the Historical Threshold as the Parties may agree (collectively, the \"Additional Amount\").\n\n(d) In implementing the foregoing, the parties shall follow the following principles: (i) that Monsanto's sales of Roundup Ag Products are not intended for Lawn and Garden Use and that Monsanto shall not sell Roundup Ag Products directly or promote the indirect sale thereof, through Lawn and Garden Channels to consumers for Lawn and Garden Use in the Included Markets and (ii) that there shall be no transfer of historical or future sales of Roundup Ag Products in the Ag Market into Program Sales Revenues. Furthermore, the parties acknowledge that Roundup Ag Products having a formulation consisting of 41% or more Glyphosate and in container sizes over 2.5 gallons in the United States or over one liter in the other Included Markets shall be presumed to have no Lawn and Garden Use and therefor that sales of such Roundup Ag Products shall not be deemed to compete with Roundup Products in a manner that would justify adjustment of the calculation of Program Sales Revenues; provided that if the Agent is able to demonstrate to the Steering Committee that a material change in the amount of such Roundup Ag Products above the Historical Threshold are being sold through Lawn and Garden Channels to consumers for Lawn and Garden Use in the Included Markets, the parties shall negotiate in good faith pursuant to Section 3.8(c) to adjust the calculation of Program Sales Revenues. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the Agent, any of its Affiliates and/or Seamless Control LLC (\"Seamless Control\"), but only if Seamless Control is then controlled by Agent or an Affiliate of Agent, sells, directly or indirectly, Roundup Ag Products through Lawn and Garden Channels to consumers in the Lawn and Garden Market in the Included Markets above the Historical Threshold, sales of such Roundup Ag Products shall (i) to the extent in excess of the Historical Threshold, be added to the Historical Threshold and (ii) not be considered by Monsanto or the Agent when determining the Additional Amount.\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) During the 2014 Program Year and for each Program Year thereafter, in consideration for the Agent's marketing, distribution and sales of Roundup 365, for the 2014 Program Year, and for each Program Year thereafter, if 365 Gross Profits exceed USD $10MM in a Program Year, the Agent shall be paid an amount equal to 7% of the 365 Gross Profits for such Program Year (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the first USD $10MM of the 365 Gross Profits). The amount that becomes payable under this Section 3.8(e) with respect to a Program Year shall be included as a separate line item in the Commission Statements delivered by Agent to Monsanto and the payment of such amount shall be in addition to the Commission otherwise payable under Section 3.6(b) and shall be subject to all other terms and conditions of this Agreement except as otherwise expressly stated in this Section 3.8(e).\n\nARTICLE 4 - ROUNDUP L&G BUSINESS MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE\n\nSection 4.1 Underlying principles for the Roundup L&G Business Management Structure.\n\n(a) The Roundup L&G Business management structure, as described in this Article, has been created for the purposes of fostering and promoting the following interests of the parties:\n\n(i) Common Interests:\n\n(A) achieve the maximum volume and profit levels for the Roundup Business;\n\n(B) continue to strengthen the Roundup brand; and\n\n(C) leverage the strengths of both parties while working together in a constructive and harmonious way.\n\n(ii) Monsanto's Interests:\n\n(A) retain ability to resume full management of the Roundup Business upon termination of this Agreement;\n\n(B) retain control over key business decisions; and\n\n(C) provide global stewardship of the Roundup brand.\n\n(iii) The Agent's Interests:\n\n(A) manage the Roundup Business within the parameters of approved Annual Business Plans.\n\n(b) The parties understand that such structure may be amended from time to time by mutual agreement of the parties provided any such change shall take into account the respective interests of each party as described hereunder.\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 4.2 Steering Committee.\n\n(a) Appointment. Monsanto and the Agent shall each appoint by April 1 of each year two (2) executives to a steering committee (\"Steering Committee\") provided, however, any vacancy shall be filled in such a manner that the parties shall maintain their respective proportionate representation on the Steering Committee and that upon failure by either party to appoint said two (2) executives by such time, the two (2) executives previously appointed by such party shall be deemed appointed for another Program Year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the members of the Steering Committee for the Program Year 2017 shall be the individuals whose names are set forth as Schedule 4.2(a) attached hereto. Either party may also invite a reasonable number of additional members from their respective organizations to attend meetings of the Steering Committee as they deem appropriate; provided, that, except to the extent provided under this Agreement, such additional members in attendance shall not have any voting rights.\n\n(b) Meetings, Quorum and Voting Requirements.\n\n(1) Meetings. The Steering Committee shall meet at least once a year for purposes of approving the Annual Business Plan no later than September 15 of every calendar year.

The quorum for any meeting of the Steering Committee shall require the participation of all four (4) members except that any member shall be deemed present when participating via phone or video conference. Any decisions by the Steering Committee may be taken by the affirmative vote of a majority of three of the members of the Steering Committee. In the event of a deadlock, when a particular vote is divided equally between the four members, the matter shall be submitted to Monsanto's senior executive responsible for the oversight of the Roundup L&G Business (as determined by Monsanto) (the \"Monsanto Senior Executive\"), who shall have the exclusive discretion to resolve the matter and such decision shall bind the Steering Committee to such action or inaction. Notwithstanding any future assignment of this Agreement to a third party by reason of a Roundup Sale, the Monsanto Senior Executive shall retain its right of veto in case of deadlock of the Steering Committee.\n\nFor every meeting of the Steering Committee, minutes shall be kept and circulated for approval to all four members. Every decision of the Monsanto Senior Executive shall also be recorded in writing and distributed to the members of the Steering Committee.\n\n(c) Authority.

The Roundup L&G Business shall be managed, on behalf of the Agent, by its respective pesticide business units for each of the Included Markets (\"Business Units\") provided that, for the management of the Roundup L&G Business, the head of each of the Business Units shall report directly to the Steering Committee.\n\n(b) Duties. The Business Units shall be responsible for:\n\n(i) taking any and all necessary actions to implement the approved Annual Business Plan and strategic plans, as may be amended from time to time, either by mutual agreement of the Business Unit and the Global Support Team or by the Steering Committee as described in Section 4.2(c);\n\n(ii) managing the day-to-day Roundup L&G Business;\n\n(iii) developing and submitting, in cooperation with the Global Support Team all strategic and Annual Business Plans;\n\n(iv) communicating, in writing or via meetings, on a regular basis, with the Global Support Team on all significant issues affecting the Roundup L&G Business; and\n\n(v) notifying the Global Support Team of any deviation to the Annual Business Plan, which, in their view, is reasonably likely to have a financial impact on the Program EBIT of at least $500,000 or constitutes a significant deviation from a non-financial item approved in the Annual Business Plan (\"Significant Deviation\").\n\nSection 4.4 Global Support Team.\n\n(a) Appointment. Monsanto shall maintain a team of up to 10 employees, or such number as the Agent and Monsanto may agree to from time to time, to support the Roundup\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\nL&G Business on a full-time basis as well as other employees who will support the Roundup L&G Business on a part-time basis (the \"Global Support Team\"). Monsanto may from time to time substitute any individual serving on the Global Support Team, with the written approval of the Agent, by providing a prior written notice to the Agent to such effect.\n\n(b) Duties. The Global Support Team shall be responsible to:\n\n(i) participate actively in the development of all strategic and Annual Business Plans;\n\n(ii) act as a liaison between any of Monsanto's functions or departments providing a support service to the Roundup Business (such as R&D, regulatory, etc.) and monitor the quality of services rendered;\n\n(iii) provide stewardship for the Roundup brand image worldwide;\n\n(iv) prepare internal assessments of the performance of the Roundup L&G Business for Monsanto management;\n\n(v) participate in planned key customer interactions and program presentations, either by participation in meetings or in preparatory sessions therefor;\n\n(vi) review and approve any material change or deviation in consumer communication, mass media, packaging design or any other marketing tactic that directly impacts the consumer perception and interface with the brand which may occur from time to time; and\n\n(vii) review and approve any Significant Deviation from the Annual Business Plan; and upon failure to agree with the Business Unit, prepare a recommendation to submit to the Steering Committee for resolution, provided that the Business Unit may similarly prepare a recommendation to submit to the Steering Committee.\n\nARTICLE 5 - DUTIES AND OBLIGATIONS OF MONSANTO\n\nSection 5.1 Monsanto's Obligations and Rights. Subject to Article 3, unless and until expressly directed otherwise by the Business Units, with the prior written approval of the Steering Committee Monsanto shall continue to support the Roundup L&G Business by performing necessary services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at all times during the term of this Agreement, Monsanto shall be solely responsible for the following functions:\n\n(a) Research and Development. Monsanto shall (i) in its sole discretion, continue to develop new Glyphosate- based non-selective herbicide formulations and (ii) exercise commercially reasonable efforts and cooperate in good faith with the Agent to develop other non-selective herbicide formulations, in each case, as more particularly as described in Section 6.10 hereof;\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Regulatory Compliance.

For Roundup Products with which Monsanto offers a \"written warranty,\" whether within the meaning of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty--Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act, 15 United States Code Annotated, Section 2301, or otherwise, Monsanto shall honor those warranties in accordance with such terms.\n\nARTICLE 6 - REPORTS AND ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES\n\nSection 6.1 Cooperation. The Agent and Monsanto shall cooperate with each other so as to facilitate the objectives set forth in this Agreement and shall act in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner in performing their respective duties hereunder.\n\nSection 6.2 Use of EDI.

The method of exchange will be approved by the Steering Committee and will include file transfer, e-mail and EDI protocol.\n\nSection 6.3 The Agent's Systems and Reporting Obligation. The Agent shall establish and maintain all such systems and procedures (financial, logistical, or otherwise) as reasonably requested by Monsanto or the Steering Committee in connection with the Agent's performance under this Agreement. For all reports, the data will include current period and current YTD, forecasts and budgets; and comparisons with same period and YTD and forecasts and budgets for the year previous. Specifically, the Agent shall provide the following reports:\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Weekly Reports.

Further, the Agent shall ensure that the appropriate personnel are compensated in a manner reasonably intended to encourage them to promote the sale of Roundup Products in a commercially reasonable manner generally consistent with other products or product lines, of similar volume or having similar margins (as compared to the overall Roundup P&L margins), of the Agent.\n\nSection 6.5 Insurance. The Agent, shall, during the term of this Agreement, maintain full insurance against the risk of loss or damages to the Roundup Products for any Agents' warehouse where Roundup Products are under the custody of the Agent and, upon request, shall furnish Monsanto with satisfactory evidence of the maintenance of said insurance. Further, each party shall make all contributions and pay all payroll taxes required under federal social security laws and state unemployment compensation laws or other payments under any laws of a similar character as to its own personnel involved in the Roundup L&G Business (including any purported \"independent\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\ncontractors\" subsequently classified by any authority under any Law, as an employee) in connection with the performance of this Agreement.\n\nSection 6.6 Liens. Subject to the provisions of any existing intercreditor agreement to which Monsanto is currently a party (as the same may be amended, modified or terminated) and except as may otherwise be agreed to by Monsanto, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld in the case of similar arrangements with existing or future institutional lenders, the Agent agrees not to allow any liens or encumbrances of any nature to attach to Roundup Products. At Monsanto's request, the Agent, sub-agent, or sub-distributor shall execute such financing statements, security agreements and other documents as Monsanto may reasonably request to create, perfect, and continue in effect its security interests hereunder.\n\nSection 6.7 Promoting Safe Use-Practices. Roundup Products may be or become hazardous unless used in strict accordance with Monsanto's product labels. The Agent shall use commercially reasonable methods to inform and familiarize its employees, agents, Customers, contractors (including warehousemen and transporters) and others who may handle or use Roundup Products of the potential hazards pertaining thereto (including accidental breakage or fire), and shall stress the safe use and application of Roundup Products in strict accordance with Monsanto's product labels. In addition, the Agent shall provide HM126F training to its personnel as required by the United States Department of Transportation (and such other training as may be required by other countries within the Included Markets).

From time to time, as Monsanto or the Steering Committee may request, the Agent shall permit, upon reasonable request and during normal business hours, representatives of Monsanto or the Steering Committee to inspect, with regard to Roundup Products, the Agent's inventories, warehousing, and shipping procedures.\n\nSection 6.9 Recalls. The Agent shall cooperate with Monsanto, and promptly take such actions as requested by Monsanto, with respect to any defective product including any \"stop-sales\" or recalls for Roundup Products.\n\nSection 6.10 New Roundup Products.\n\n(a) During the term of this Agreement, Monsanto covenants and agrees to first offer (the \"Product Offer\") to the Agent, with respect to the Included Markets, the exclusive agency and distribution rights to any newly created non-selective herbicide product, which is not marketed for Lawn and Garden Use as of the date of this Agreement, and which Monsanto, in its exclusive, reasonable discretion, determines to be suitable for sale as a new product for Lawn and Garden Use (the \"New Product\"); provided, however, that for the Lawn and Garden Market, that any new product containing Glyphosate or another non- selective herbicide shall be considered to be a New Product. The Product Offer shall be in writing, shall be in sufficient detail describing such New Product, and shall be made within sixty (60) days of the date of commercialization of such New Product for uses other than Lawn and Garden Use. In no event shall Monsanto, directly or indirectly, commercialize any New Product for Lawn and Garden Use in the Included Markets without first offering such New Product to the Agent pursuant to the terms of this Section 6.10. If the Agent agrees in writing\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\nwithin ninety (90) days of receipt of the Product Offer to accept the New Product, then such New Product shall be, without further action or amendment, included within the definition of Roundup Products and be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In such event, the parties shall adjust the Commission Thresholds to reflect this additional source of revenue unless the New Product is a Glyphosate-based product or an improvement of any existing Roundup Products in which case the Commission Thresholds shall remain the same. If the Agent fails to agree in writing to accept the Product Offer within such ninety (90) days of receipt, then Monsanto shall have the exclusive right to manufacture, package, promote, distribute, and sell such New Product in the Included Markets, regardless of any actual or potential conflict with the terms of Agreement.\n\n(b) During the term of this Agreement, the Agent may, from time to time, propose that Monsanto utilize a different formulation of non-selective herbicide product for Lawn and Garden Use in the Included Markets that may or may not contain Glyphosate (an \"Agent Proposed Product\") and offer the Agent the exclusive agency and distribution rights to such Agent Proposed Product under this Agreement. Any Agent Proposed Product proposal shall contain supporting detail describing the Agent Proposed Product. The Agent shall supply Monsanto with any information Monsanto reasonably requests as part of its evaluation. Monsanto shall not unreasonably delay its evaluation of an Agent Proposed Product following receipt of any such information. Monsanto shall give good faith consideration to all Agent Proposed Products, and provided that Monsanto shall have the sole discretion in branding any Agent Proposed Product, Monsanto shall not unreasonably refuse to submit to the Agent a Product Offer for an Agent Proposed Product under Section 6.10(a) that is, in Monsanto's reasonable discretion, commercially attractive, taking into account all relevant legal, financial, regulatory and other material aspects, including, without limitation, any possible effect of such Agent Proposed Product on Monsanto's overall business and business prospects.\n\n(c) The Agent hereby grants Monsanto an exclusive (even with respect to the Agent and its Affiliates), non- transferrable, royalty-free license and right to use the trademarks EcoSense and Path Clear (Trademark Application No. 1430287) in Canada (such trademarks, the \"Canada Marks\"), only in connection with Natural Products (as defined below) in the natural non-selective weedkiller category for Lawn & Garden Use during the term of this Agreement. Monsanto agrees to use the Canada Marks in a manner consistent with the form and style of such trademarks as used by the Agent, or as otherwise agreed in writing with the Agent. For the avoidance of doubt, the Agent currently uses and/or may in the future use the Canada Marks on products in categories other than non-selective weedkillers for Lawn & Garden Use, and the license granted to Monsanto herein shall not affect or restrict the Agent's rights in such other categories. Such license shall terminate automatically upon any expiration or termination of the term of this Agreement applicable to Canada. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall be interpreted as granting Monsanto a license to the Canada Marks outside of Canada or outside the category specified in this Section 6.10(c). The Agent represents and warrants that it is a licensee with the right to sublicense the Canada Marks, and that Monsanto's use of the Canada Marks, as described herein, shall not infringe upon the rights of any third party. The Agent agrees to hold harmless, indemnify, and defend Monsanto from any and all claims, demands, damages, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from a breach of this warranty by the Agent. The Agent agrees to carry out at its expense, all procedures necessary to register and maintain the Canada\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\nMarks in full force and effect and Monsanto agrees to cooperate with the Agent in providing any product sample or other required information to assist in the maintenance and renewal of the Canada Marks. Monsanto acknowledges OMS Investments, Inc.'s exclusive ownership of all right, title and interest in and to the Canada Marks and agrees that Monsanto's use of the Canada Marks shall inure to the benefit of OMS Investments, Inc. Monsanto further agrees that it will in no way dispute, impugn or attack the validity of said Canada Marks or OMS Investments, Inc.'s or the Agent's rights thereto.\n\n(d) The Agent hereby grants to Monsanto exclusive access to the registrations for an acetic acid/citric acid nonselective weedkiller formulation in Canada. The parties will agree on the mutually acceptable details and mechanics of access and appropriate registration/labeling rights, the cost of which will be included in the Roundup P&L. Access to the then-current registrations shall continue in perpetuity, on a nonexclusive basis, following any future termination or expiration of this Agreement, enabling Monsanto or its successors to market and sell such formulations following such termination under trademarks that are different from the trademarks licensed to Monsanto pursuant to Section 6.10(c).\n\n(e) Together, the respective trademark licenses and registration access provided pursuant to this Section 6.10 result in the following product: an acetic acid/citric acid nonselective weedkiller formulation under the EcoSense brand in Canada and an acetic acid nonselective weed killer formulation under the Path Clear brand in Canada (collectively, the \"Natural Products\"). Any Natural Product marketed and/or sold under a different brand name in Canada shall be deemed to be a Natural Product and subject to the terms of this Agreement. The Natural Products will be included in the Roundup P&L and shall be subject to the same terms, rights and obligations set forth in this Agreement as are the Roundup Products, except as modified by this Section 6.10. In the event that the Agent develops, or obtains access to, any improvements to the existing Natural Products formulations in Canada during the respective term of this Agreement, the Agent will grant Monsanto access to such improvements and the improved products will be included in the Roundup P&L on the same terms as agreed for the current formulations of the Natural Products. In the event that the Agent develops, or obtains access to, any new natural nonselective weedkiller products (including, without limitation, any herbicidally active substances which are plant extracts, including those derived from oleic acid or which are derived from plant extracts by processing including active substances) in Canada during the respective term of this Agreement, the Agent will grant Monsanto a right of first refusal to include such new products in the Roundup P&L on the same terms as agreed for the current Natural Products, and if accepted, such new products will become Natural Products. In the event that the Agent offers in writing a product to Monsanto pursuant to the terms of this Section 6.10(e) and Monsanto does not accept such product in writing within 90 days of the Agent's offer, the Agent may market such product at its own discretion utilizing an alternative trademark from those licensed to Monsanto pursuant to Section 6.10(c) (which alternative trademark is not identical or materially similar to the Canada Trademarks.\n\n(f) The marketing, sale and distribution of each of the Natural Products in Canada shall be governed in all respects by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including without limitation, the calculation of the Commission pursuant to Section 3.6 hereof. Following the inclusion of the Natural Products in the Roundup L&G Business in Canada, and fully consistent\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\nwith the performance standards and requirements of Section 2.2(b) of this Agreement, the performance of the Roundup L&G Business will be evaluated based on the total results of the business, including from current Roundup Products, the added Natural Products, and any future products added to the Roundup L&G Business. Subject to the provisions of the applicable Annual Business Plan, the Agent shall continue to promote Roundup Products in the manner described in Section 2.2(a)(7). The parties will ensure that marketing, promotional and selling plans promote the sale of the Natural Products in a manner that is consistent with this Agreement and complementary to Roundup Products, and does not directly or indirectly disparage or advertise against Roundup Products, as set forth in this Agreement. Furthermore, in addition to marketing and selling the Natural Products in such a manner to existing Customers, the Agent will use its best efforts to target retailers and customers who do not currently purchase Roundup Products. Without limiting the foregoing, the Agent hereby agrees that matters relating to the Naturals Products shall be included in the Annual Business Plan.\n\n(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the letter agreement dated February 26, 2010 between the Agent and Monsanto shall survive in full force and effect in its entirety.\n\n(h) No provision of this Section 6.10 should be understood, explicitly or implicitly, as an amendment of the noncompetition provisions of this Agreement, or a relinquishment by either party of their rights or waiver of their obligations except as expressly set forth in this Section 6.10.\n\nSection 6.11 Additional Roundup Products.\n\n(a) Each product listed in Schedule 6.11(a) (an \"Additional Roundup Product\") shall be included in the definition of \"Roundup Products\" for the purposes of this Agreement; provided, that, such Additional Roundup Products shall only be considered \"Roundup Products\" with respect to those countries set forth in the column titled \"Included Markets\" opposite such Additional Roundup Product in Schedule 6.11(a).\n\n(b) For purposes hereof, \"Additional Roundup Products Formulation Data\" shall mean the formula for the Additional Roundup Products, the raw material specifications, analytical methods, and other information as provided in the Quality Assurance Manual (as defined in the Formulation Agreement), the instructions and know how associated with formulating the Additional Roundup Products and any and all data related to the Additional Roundup Products required to make, sell, offer for sale, register with federal, state, or territorial government authorities (as may be required by law), and support and defend marketing claims for, the Additional Roundup Products in the United States and its territories. Such data may include, but is not limited to, validations of field efficacy, stability testing data, and toxicology studies. The Agent shall make all Additional Roundup Products Formulation Data available to Monsanto. For the avoidance of doubt, Additional Roundup Products Formulation Data shall not include any data which originated with Monsanto.\n\n(c) The Agent hereby grants to Monsanto, during the term of this Agreement, a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non- transferable and non-assignable license (without the right to\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n\nsublicense, except as specifically set forth in Section 6.11(h)) to use the Additional Roundup Products Formulation Data for the purpose of and to the limited extent necessary to register each of the Additional Roundup Products with federal, state, or territorial government authorities (as may be required by law) in the United States and its territories.

Except as provided for in Section 3.8, Monsanto covenants and agrees that for the Noncompetition Period, Monsanto will not, nor will it permit any Affiliate to, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate or control, or participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of, or be connected with or have any interest in, as a shareholder, partner, creditor or otherwise, any \"Competitive Business.\" A Competitive Business shall be any business which, anywhere within the Included Markets, (x) manufactures, sells, markets or\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n\ndistributes any non-selective weed control product, whether residual or non-residual, for Lawn and Garden Use or (y) competes with the Roundup L&G Business; provided, however, this Section 6.13(b) shall not apply to those actions of Monsanto or any Affiliate (i) to the extent such actions are expressly contemplated by this Agreement, for the duration of this Agreement, (ii) to the extent that immediately upon termination of this Agreement for whatever reason Monsanto or any Affiliates or successor to the Roundup L&G Business shall continue to operate the Roundup L&G Business without infringing this covenant, or (iii) to the extent that Monsanto's interest in a Competitive Business, as a shareholder, partner, creditor or otherwise, is equal to or less than 5%.\n\n(1) In the event any Exclusive Mexican Business makes a material change in its business model to target sales to consumers outside of the Lawn and Garden Market, Monsanto will notify the Agent in writing that it wishes to begin selling Mexican Roundup Ag Products to such identified business. The Agent will have thirty (30) days to provide any written objection to Monsanto's request. If the Agent does not object to the request, such identified Exclusive Mexican Business will no longer remain exclusive to the Agent. If the Agent objects to Monsanto's request, Monsanto shall have the ability to raise its request to the Steering Committee for final determination. Monsanto shall continue to maintain the right to sell Mexican Roundup Ag Products, labeled for the Ag Market, regardless of size, to any business that markets and makes sales to the Ag Market in Mexico, regardless of whether that business also markets and makes sales to consumers for use in, on or around residential homes, residential lawns and residential gardens, and such sales shall not constitute a violation of Section 6.13(b) of this Agreement. Monsanto's Mexican Roundup Ag Products shall not be included in the Program Sales Revenue, regardless of SKU size.\n\n(c) Agent's Covenant. The Agent covenants and agrees that during the Noncompetition Period, the Agent will not, nor will it permit any Affiliate to, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate or control, or participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of, or be connected with or have any interest in, as a shareholder, partner, creditor or otherwise, any Competitive Business; provided, however, this Section 6.13(c) shall not apply to those actions of the Agent or any Affiliate (i) to the extent such actions are expressly contemplated by this Agreement, for such term of this Agreement; (ii) to the extent such actions relate to the products listed on Exhibit D hereto in the countries listed therein, the products that the Agent either owns, has contracted to purchase or entered into a letter of intent with respect to as of the Effective Date and such additional products as the parties may from time to time agree (the \"Permitted Products\"); (iii) to the extent that the Agent's interest in a Competitive Business, as a shareholder, partner, creditor or otherwise, is equal to or less than 5%; or (iv) to any separate agreement with Monsanto with respect to transgenic technology sharing. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.13(c), the Agent shall have the right to market and make sales of Roundup Products labeled for Lawn and Garden Use to any business that markets and makes sales to Lawn and Garden Channels in Mexico regardless of whether that business also makes sales to the Ag Market in Mexico, and such sales shall not constitute a violation of Section 6.13(c) of this Section 6.13(c).\n\n(d) Non-Solicitation by Monsanto. Monsanto agrees that for the duration of the Noncompetition Period and for the two years thereafter, without the prior written consent of the Agent, it will not, nor will it permit any of its Affiliates to (i) solicit for employment any person\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n\nthen employed by the Agent or any of its Affiliates or (ii) knowingly employ any employee of the Agent or any of its Affiliates who voluntarily terminates such employment with the Agent (or such Affiliate) after the Effective Date, until three months have passed following termination of such employment.\n\n(e) Non-Solicitation by the Agent. The Agent agrees that for the duration of the Noncompetition Period, without the prior written consent of Monsanto, it will not, nor will it permit any of its Affiliates to (i) solicit for employment any person then employed who works primarily with Roundup Products or with other products with Lawn & Garden Uses (\"Lawn & Garden Employee\") by Monsanto or any of its Affiliates or (ii) knowingly employ any Lawn & Garden Employee of Monsanto or any of its Affiliates who voluntarily terminates such employment with Monsanto (or such Affiliate) after the Effective Date, until three months have passed following termination of such employment.\n\n(f) Consideration. The consideration for the agreements contained in this Section 6.13 are the mutual covenants contained herein, the agreement of the parties to consummate the purchase of the Non-Roundup Assets, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged.\n\n(g) Modification. In the event a court (or other authority) refuses to enforce the covenants and agreements contained in this Section 6.13, either because of the scope of the geographical area specified in this Section 6.13, the duration of the restrictions, or otherwise, the parties hereto expressly confirm their intention that the geographical areas covered hereby, the time period of the restrictions, or such other provision, be deemed automatically reduced to the minimum extent necessary to permit enforcement.\n\n(h) Injunctive Relief. The parties acknowledge and agree that the extent of damages to one party (the \"non- breaching party\") in the event of an actual or threatened breach of this Section 6.13 by the other party (the \"breaching party\") may be impossible to ascertain and there may be available to the non-breaching party no adequate remedy at law to compensate the non-breaching party in the event of such an actual or threatened breach by the breaching party. Consequently, the parties agree that, in the event that either party breaches or threatens to breach any such covenant or agreement, the non-breaching party shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy or relief to which it may be entitled, including without limitation, money damages, to seek to enforce any or all of such agreements or covenants against the breaching party by injunctive or other equitable relief ordered by any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nSection 6.14 Industrial Property.\n\n(a) Monsanto represents and warrants that Monsanto or Affiliates are the exclusive owners of the trademarks, trade names, packages, copyrights and designs used in the sale of Roundup Products (hereinafter referred to as \"Industrial Property\"). To Monsanto's knowledge, the conduct of the Roundup L&G Business as now being conducted and the use of the Industrial Property in the conduct of the Roundup L&G Business, do not infringe or otherwise conflict with any trademarks, registrations, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights of others, nor has any claim been made that the conduct of the Roundup L&G Business as now being conducted\n\n38\n\n\n\n\n\ninfringes or otherwise is covered by the intellectual property of a third party, except for any conflict or infringement which would not have a material adverse effect. To the knowledge of Monsanto, none of the Industrial Property is currently being infringed upon by a third party.\n\n(b) The Agent acknowledges the validity of the trademarks which designate and identify Roundup Products. The Agent further acknowledges that Monsanto is the exclusive owner of the Industrial Property.\n\n(c) The Agent agrees that, to the extent it uses Industrial Property, such Industrial Property shall be used in its standard form and style as it appears upon Roundup Products or as instructed in writing by Monsanto. No other letter(s), word(s), design(s), symbol(s) or other matter of any kind shall be superimposed upon, associated with or shown in such proximity to the Industrial Property so as to tend to alter or dilute such Industrial Property, and the Agent further agrees not to combine or associate any of such Industrial Property with any other industrial property. The generic or common name of the type of product (e.g., \"non-selective herbicide\") must always follow Roundup Products' trademarks.\n\n(d) In all advertisements, sales and promotional or other printed matter in which any Industrial Property appears, the Agent shall identify itself by full name and address and state its relationship to Monsanto. In all such material, the Roundup trademark shall be identified as a trademark owned by Monsanto Company. In the case of a registered trademark, a \u00ae shall be placed adjacent to the trademark with the \u00ae referring to a footnote reading \"\u00ae Registered trademark of Monsanto Company.\" In the case of unregistered trademarks, a \"TM\" shall be placed adjacent to the trademark with the \"TM\" referring to a footnote reading \"TM Trademark of Monsanto Company.\"\n\n(e) On its letterheads, business cards, invoices, statements, etc., the Agent may identify itself as a distributor for the Industrial Property.\n\n(f) The Agent agrees that it will never use any Industrial Property or any simulation of such Industrial Property as part of the Agent's corporate or other trading name or designation of any kind.\n\n(g) Upon expiration or in the event of any termination of this Agreement, the Agent shall promptly discontinue every use of the Industrial Property and any language stating or suggesting the Agent is a distributor for Roundup Products.

The Agent shall not promote the sale of products using trademarks, packages or designs which are in Monsanto's opinion deceptively similar to Industrial Property.\n\n39\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 6.15 Conflicts of Interest. Conflicts of interest relating to this Agreement are strictly prohibited. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, neither party nor any of its directors, employees or agents, or its subcontractors or vendors shall give to or receive from any director, employee or agent of the other party any gift, entertainment or other favor of significant value, or any commission, fee or rebate. Likewise, neither party nor its directors, employees or agents or its subcontractors or vendors shall, without prior written notification thereof to the other party, enter into any business relationship with any director, employee, or agent of the other party or any of its Affiliates unless such person is acting for and on behalf of such party. Each party shall promptly notify the other of any violation of this Section 6.15 and any consideration received as a result of such violation shall be paid over or credited to the other party.\n\nSection 6.16 Records Retention. The Agent and Monsanto shall each maintain true and complete records in connection with this Agreement and shall retain all such records for at least forty-eight (48) months following the termination or expiration of this Agreement. This obligation shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n\nSection 6.17 Additional Covenant of the Agent. The Agent shall not take any action or fail to take any action that materially adversely impacts the Roundup brand or the Ag Market; provided, however, that the Agent shall have no liability for any event resulting primarily by an act or omission of Monsanto or its Affiliates.\n\nSection 6.18 Roundup Telephone Number. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Agent currently is the party of record for the tollfree service number 1-888-768-6387 (1-888-ROUNDUP). The Agent hereby acknowledges and agrees that it will transfer the right to use such telephone number back to Monsanto within thirty (30) days of Monsanto providing notice to the Agent of Monsanto's decision to become the party of record for such telephone number.\n\nSection 6.19 Additional Obligations. Unless expressly agreed by the parties in writing on a country-by-country basis, Monsanto shall not sell, or promote the indirect sale of, the 1.67 Gallon Roundup Pro Max SKU through Lawn and Garden Channels in the Included Markets; provided, that the foregoing shall not be deemed an acknowledgement by Monsanto that a 1.67 Gallon package product or any other package size cannot have agricultural uses.\n\nARTICLE 7 - [RESERVED]\n\nARTICLE 8 - REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND COVENANTS\n\nSection 8.1 The Agent's Representations and Warranties.

The payment of a Termination Fee to the Agent under Section 10.4(c) shall be deemed to constitute the exclusive remedy for any damages resulting out of the termination of this Agreement by Monsanto or the successor to the Roundup Business pursuant\n\n45\n\n\n\n\n\nto Section 10.4(c) and the Agent shall waive its right to exercise any other remedies otherwise available at law or in equity.\n\n(g) Arbitration. In the event either party claims that a Material Breach, a Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct has been committed by the other party (the \"Breaching Party\"), or this Agreement otherwise explicitly provides that the provisions of this Section 10.4(g) apply, the following procedures shall apply:\n\n(1) After the asserted occurrence of a Material Breach, a Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct, the party who contends that such breach, fraud or misconduct has occurred (the \"Claimant\") shall send to the Breaching Party a notice, in accordance with the notice provisions of Section 11.9 of this Agreement, in which the Claimant shall: (i) identify the Material Breach, Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct which it contends has occurred; (ii) appoint an arbitrator; and (iii) demand that the Breaching Party appoint an arbitrator.\n\n(2) Within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the notice, the Breaching Party shall send a response to the Claimant, in accordance with the notice provisions of Section 11.9 of this Agreement, in which the Breaching Party shall: (i) indicate whether it contests the asserted occurrence of the Material Breach, Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct, as the case may be; and (ii) if it does contest such asserted occurrence, appoint a second arbitrator. The failure on the part of the Breaching Party to timely respond to the notice, and/or to timely appoint its arbitrator, shall be deemed to constitute acceptance of the arbitrator designated by the Claimant as the 'sole arbitrator.\n\n(3) If the Breaching Party appoints an arbitrator, then within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of the Breaching Party's response by the Claimant, the two arbitrators shall jointly appoint a third arbitrator. If the arbitrators selected by the parties are unable or fail to agree upon the third arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be selected by the American Arbitration Association. Upon their selection by either means, the three arbitrators (the \"Arbitrators\") shall expeditiously proceed to determine whether a Material Breach, Material Default or Material Willful Misconduct has occurred, in accordance with the procedures hereafter set forth.\n\n(4) Except as specifically modified herein, the arbitration proceeding contemplated by this section (the \"Arbitration\") shall be conducted in accordance with Title 9 of the US Code (United States Arbitration Act) and the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The cost of the Arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties, with the understanding that the Arbitrators may reimburse the prevailing party, if any, as determined by the Arbitrators for that party's cost of the Arbitration in connection with the award made by the Arbitrators as described below.\n\n(5) The award shall be made within three (3) months after the appointment of the third Arbitrator, and each of the Arbitrators shall agree to comply with this schedule before accepting appointment. However, this time limit may be extended by agreement of the parties or by the Arbitrators, if necessary.\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n\n(6) Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, each party will, upon the written request of the other party, promptly provide the other with copies of documents relevant to the issues raised by the notice or the response, including those documents on which the producing party may rely in support of or in opposition to any claim or defense. Any dispute regarding discovery, or the relevance or scope thereof, shall be determined by the Arbitrators, which determination shall be conclusive. All discovery shall be completed within 60 days following the appointment of the third Arbitrator.\n\n(7) At the request of a party, the Arbitrators shall have the discretion to order examination by deposition of witnesses to the extent the Arbitrators deem such additional discovery relevant and appropriate. Depositions shall be held within 30 days of the making of a request, and shall be limited to a maximum of number of hours' duration as may be mutually agreed to by the parties, or in the absence of such agreement as may be determined by the Arbitrators. All objections are reserved for the arbitration hearing, except for objections based on privilege and proprietary or confidential information.\n\n(8) Either party may apply to the Arbitrators seeking injunctive relief until the arbitration award is rendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved. Either party also may, without waiving any remedy under this Agreement, seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim or provisional relief that is necessary to protect the rights or property of that party, pending the establishment of the arbitral tribunal (or pending the arbitral tribunal's determination of the merits of the controversy).\n\n(9) The scope of the Arbitration shall include the following:\n\n(i) a determination as to whether the act(s) or omission(s) set forth by the Claimant have occurred;\n\n(ii) a determination as to whether those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred constitute a breach of this Agreement, fraudulent conduct in connection with this Agreement, or willful misconduct in connection with this Agreement, as the case may be;\n\n(iii) a determination as to whether those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred constitute a Material Breach, a Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct, as the case may be;\n\n(iv) a determination as to the amount of monetary damages, if any, suffered by the Claimant, as a result of those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred which constitute a breach of this Agreement, fraudulent conduct in connection with this Agreement, or willful misconduct in connection with this Agreement, as the case may be, regardless of whether such act(s) or omission(s) rise to the level of Material Breach, Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct, as the case may be;\n\n(v) a determination, to the extent applicable, of the specific performance which could and should be decreed to correct any breach, fraud or material misconduct which the Arbitrators determine can be cured by the issuance of such decree;\n\n47\n\n\n\n\n\n(vi) a determination as to which party, if any, is the prevailing party in the Arbitration, and the amount of such party's costs and fees. \"Costs and fees\" means all reasonable pre-award expenses of the arbitration, including the arbitrators' fees, administrative fees, travel expenses, out-of-pocket expenses such as copying and telephone, court costs, witness fees, and attorneys' fees; and\n\n(vii) a determination as to such matters as the Arbitrators deem necessary and appropriate to carry out their duties in connection with the Arbitration.\n\n(10) The Arbitrators' award shall be in writing, shall be signed by a majority of the Arbitrators, and shall include a statement regarding the reasons for the disposition of any claim.\n\n(11) The Arbitrators' award shall, as applicable, include the following:\n\n(i) to the extent that the Arbitrators determine that the Claimant has suffered monetary damages as a result of those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred which constitute a breach of this Agreement, fraudulent conduct in connection with this Agreement, or willful misconduct in connection with this Agreement, as the case may be, a monetary award in the amount of those damages;\n\n(ii) to the extent that the Arbitrators determine that the harm resulting from those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred can be cured, in whole or in part by a decree of specific performance, such a decree of specific performance implementing such determination as can be submitted to and made the order of a Court of competent jurisdiction;\n\n(iii) to the extent that the Arbitrators determine that those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred constitute a Material Breach, a Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct, as the case may be, an award authorizing the Claimant to immediately terminate this Agreement, together with damages or specific performance, if determined by the Arbitrators to be appropriate;\n\n(iv) to the extent that the Arbitrators determine that there is a prevailing party, and that said prevailing party should receive an award of its Costs and Fees, such award to the prevailing party; and\n\n(v) such other matters as the Arbitrators deem necessary and appropriate to implement their determinations made in the Arbitration.\n\n(12) The written determination of the Arbitrators shall be made and delivered promptly to the parties to the Arbitration and shall be final and conclusive upon the parties to the Arbitration.\n\n(13) Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor an Arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any Arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties.\n\n48\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 10.5 Termination by the Agent.\n\n(a) Material Breach, Material Fraud and Material Willful Misconduct. The Agent may terminate this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.4(g) upon:\n\n(1) a Material Breach of this Agreement committed by Monsanto and established in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.4(g) of this Agreement;\n\n(2) a Material Fraud committed by Monsanto and established in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.4(g) of this Agreement;\n\n(3) Material Willful Misconduct committed by Monsanto and established in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.4(g) of this Agreement. Such termination shall take effect on the later of the first business day following the thirtieth (30th) day after the sending of a termination notice to Monsanto in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.9, or the date designated by the Agent in said termination notice.\n\n(b) Roundup Sale. The Agent may terminate this Agreement by written notice thereof to Monsanto upon receipt of notice of a Roundup Sale as described in Section 10.6.\n\n(c) Termination Fee. Upon termination of this Agreement by the Agent pursuant to Section 10.5(a), Monsanto shall pay to the Agent the Termination Fee applicable pursuant to the Table set forth in Section 10.4(d).\n\n(d) Brand Decline Event.\n\n(i) If prior to Program Year 2023\n\n(A) the Sell-Through Business has declined by more than twenty-five percent (25%) as compared to the Sell-Through Business for Program Year 2014 due to legal, regulatory, governmental or non-governmental organization actions adversely affecting the market for Roundup Products or due to diminished consumer or retailer acceptance of Roundup Products due to anti-Monsanto or anti-glyphosate sentiment, or\n\n(B) there has been a significant decline in the overall health and goodwill of the Roundup brand, as measured by industry standard market research and best practices such as attitude and usage studies (provided that the decline is not primarily due to the acts or omissions of the Agent or its Affiliates), and, in the case of (A) or (B),\n\n(C) such declines cannot be remedied by the end of the next full Program Year,\n\nthen the Agent may provide notice to Monsanto of such alleged declines (such declines, a \"Brand Decline Event\").\n\n(ii) If Monsanto does not contest the occurrence of the alleged Brand Decline Event by submitting such alleged Brand Decline Event to resolution through\n\n49\n\n\n\n\n\narbitration in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.4(g) of this Agreement within ninety (90) days of receipt of such notice from the Agent, then that Brand Decline Event shall be deemed to have occurred as of the date of such notice, and thereafter the Agent shall be entitled to either, as the Agent's sole remedy, (x) terminate this Agreement, which termination shall be effective at the end of the third (3rd) full Program Year following the Program Year in which the Agent delivers notice of termination pursuant to this Section 10.5(d)(ii), or (y) not terminate this Agreement and be entitled to the Additional Commission Amount (in addition to the Commission) set forth in Section 10.5(d)(iv) below, which Additional Commission Amount shall be subject to all other terms and conditions of this Agreement with respect to the Commission, except as otherwise expressly stated in this Section 10.5(d).\n\n(iii) If Monsanto does contest the occurrence of the alleged Brand Decline Event by submitting such alleged Brand Decline Event to resolution through arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.4(g) of this Agreement within ninety (90) days of receipt of such notice from the Agent, then the question of whether a Brand Decline Event has occurred will be finally determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.4(g) of this Agreement, and if a Brand Decline Event is finally determined to have occurred, then the Brand Decline Event shall be deemed to have occurred as of the date of such notice, and thereafter the Agent shall be entitled to either, as the Agent's sole remedy, (x) terminate this Agreement, which termination shall be effective at the end of the third (3rd) full Program Year following the Program Year in which the Agent delivers notice of termination pursuant to this Section 10.5(d)(iii), or (y) not terminate this Agreement and be entitled to the Additional Commission Amount (in addition to the Commission) set forth in Section 10.5(d)(iv) below, which Additional Commission Amount shall be subject to all other terms and conditions of this Agreement with respect to the Commission, except as otherwise expressly stated in this Section 10.5(d).\n\n[Remainder of page intentionally left blank]\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n(iv) The amounts of the \"Additional Commission Amount\" mean, depending on the Program Year in which the Brand Decline Event occurs, the amounts indicated in the table below for the Program Years indicated:\n\nYear of Brand Decline Event => Program Year 2018 Program Year 2019 Program Year 2020 Program Year 2021 Program Year 2022\n\nAdditional Commission Amount in Program Year 2018 $10MM\n\n     Additional Commission Amount in Program Year 2019 $10MM $10MM\n\n    Additional Commission Amount in Program Year 2020 $10MM $10MM $10MM\n\n   Additional Commission Amount in Program Year 2021 $10MM $10MM $10MM $8MM\n\n  Additional Commission Amount in Program Year 2022 $10MM $10MM $10MM $8MM $6MM\n\nAdditional Commission Amount in Program Year 2023 $10MM $10MM $10MM $8MM $6MM\n\nAdditional Commission Amount in Program Year 2024 $10MM $10MM $10MM $8MM $6MM\n\nAdditional Commission Amount in Program Year 2025\n\n\n\n$8MM $6MM\n\nAdditional Commission Amount in Program Year 2026\n\n\n\n$6MM\n\nSection 10.6 Roundup Sale.\n\n(a) Roundup Sale Procedures.\n\n(i) Right of First Offer. If Monsanto (A) receives an unsolicited proposal with respect to a potential Roundup Sale and responds in any manner, other than rejecting such proposal, (B) solicits or makes a formal determination to solicit or make any proposal with respect to a potential Roundup Sale or (C) enters into an agreement relating to the provision of information with respect to a potential Roundup Sale (each a \"Roundup Sale Notice Trigger\"), the Agent shall have the rights as set forth in this Section 10.6 with respect to any such Roundup Sale and Monsanto shall promptly provide written notice to the Agent of such Roundup Sale as set forth\n\n51\n\n\n\n\n\nin Section 10.6(a)(ii) (a \"Roundup Sale Notice\"). For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 10.6(a) shall apply to any and all potential Roundup Sales.\n\n(ii) Roundup Sale Notice. Upon the occurrence of a Roundup Sale Notice Trigger, Monsanto shall promptly provide a Roundup Sale Notice to the Agent along with all Roundup Offering Materials (subject to Monsanto entering into a confidentiality agreement on commercially reasonable terms with the Agent with respect to such Roundup Offering Materials). After the occurrence of a Roundup Sale Notice Trigger, if Monsanto delivers any Roundup Offering Materials to a third party that contain material deviations from the Roundup Offering Materials previously provided to the Agent, Monsanto shall provide copies of such Roundup Offering Materials to the Agent promptly after such delivery.\n\n(iii) Exclusivity.\n\n(A) For a period of sixty (60) days from the last date of receipt by the Agent of the Roundup Sale Notice and any related Roundup Offering Materials as set forth in Section 10.6(a)(ii) (the \"Exclusive Roundup Sale Period\"), Monsanto agrees to negotiate in good faith with the Agent on an exclusive basis with respect to any potential Roundup Sale. If and only if Monsanto has complied with the provisions of the preceding sentence and no definitive agreement has been entered into with the Agent or one of its Affiliates with respect to a Roundup Sale, then following the Exclusive Roundup Sale Period, Monsanto may then make solicitations to, or otherwise negotiate with, a third party or parties with respect to a Roundup Sale and may provide the Roundup Offering Materials previously provided to the Agent to any such third party or parties in connection with a process to pursue a Roundup Sale. In the event that Monsanto engages in a process in which it seeks bids or proposals from more than one third party in connection with a contemplated Roundup Sale, the Agent shall be entitled to a fifteen (15) day exclusive negotiation period following the receipt and review by Monsanto of all bids or proposals (the \"Roundup Quiet Period\"), provided that, in determining the value of the price terms of the Agent's bid, Monsanto shall not discount the Agent's bid as a result of the fact that the Termination Fee is an offset or credit against the total purchase price, and that, during the Roundup Quiet Period, the Agent shall have the right to revise its original bid but shall not have the right to review the terms of any other bids or proposals. Monsanto may consummate a Roundup Sale with any third party only if such Roundup Sale is made pursuant to the acceptance by Monsanto of a Roundup Superior Offer.\n\n(B) During the Exclusive Roundup Sale Period, neither Monsanto nor any of its Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly through its or their agents, employees or representatives or otherwise, solicit, or cause the solicitation of, or in any way encourage the making of, any offer, proposal or indication of interest involving a Roundup Sale or negotiate with, respond to any inquiry from (except for \"no comment\" or another statement agreed to by the Agent), cooperate with or furnish or cause or authorize to be furnished any information to, any third party or its agents, employees or representatives with respect thereto, or disclose to any third party that a Roundup Sale Notice has been provided to the Agent. Monsanto will immediately advise the Agent of any offer, proposal or indication of interest received by Monsanto or its Affiliates with respect to a Roundup Sale during the Exclusive Roundup Sale Period.\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Credit of Termination Fee. In the event that the Agent or any of its Affiliates acquires the Roundup Business in a Roundup Sale, the Termination Fee that would have been payable to the Agent upon a termination pursuant to Section 10.4(a) (2) shall be credited against the purchase price to be paid by the Agent or such Affiliate in the Roundup Sale.\n\n(c) Agent's Election. In the event that Monsanto determines to consummate a Roundup Sale with a party other than the Agent, Monsanto shall deliver the Agent notice thereof and of the identity of such other party. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice, the Agent shall deliver written notice to Monsanto stating either that:\n\n(1) The Agent intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.5(b), in which case such notice shall constitute a termination notice for purposes of this Agreement provided that the termination shall be effective at the end of the Third Program Year following the Program Year in which the Agent delivers its Notice of Termination pursuant to this provision; or\n\n(2) The Agent will not terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.5(b) and agrees to continue the performance of its obligations under the Agreement unless and until the Agent receives a termination notice delivered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement by the successor to the Roundup Business.\n\n(d) Successor. Upon consummation of a Roundup Sale to a party other than the Agent, Monsanto's successor to the Roundup L&G Business shall assume all rights and responsibilities of Monsanto under this Agreement.\n\n(e) Noncompetition Upon Termination. In the event of a termination of this Agreement by Monsanto pursuant to Section 10.4(a)(2) hereof, or by the Agent pursuant to Section 10.6(c)(1) hereof, then notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.13 hereof, either party may, no earlier than three (3) years prior to the expiration of the Noncompetition Period, commence non- commercial activities (including formulation development, regulatory registrations, packaging and delivery systems development, and advertising and promotional material development and any other activities not prohibited by Section 6.13 of this Agreement during the Noncompetition Period, but excluding consumer-facing efforts or communications) for the sole purpose of such party's preparation to launch any competing product upon expiration of the Noncompetition Period; and provided, that either party may, no earlier than twelve (12) months prior to the expiration of the Noncompetition Period, engage with retail customers for the sole purpose of selling-in competing products (provided that no product may be shipped to a retail customer or distributor prior to the end of the Noncompetition Period).\n\nSection 10.7 Effect of Termination.\n\n(a) Reserved.\n\n(b) Prior Obligations and Shipments. Termination shall not affect obligations of Monsanto or of the Agent which have arisen prior to the effective date of termination.\n\n53\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Representations and Materials. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, the Agent shall not continue to represent itself as Monsanto's authorized agent to deal in Roundup Products, and shall remove, so far as practical, any printed material relating to such products from its salesperson's manuals and shall discontinue the use of any display material on or about the Agent's premises containing any reference to Roundup Products.\n\n(d) Return of Books, Records, and other Property. To the extent not otherwise provided herein, upon termination of this Agreement, the Agent shall immediately deliver to Monsanto all records, books, and other property of Monsanto.\n\nSection 10.8 Force Majeure. If either party is prevented or delayed in the performance of any of its obligations by force majeure and if such party gives written notice thereof to the other party within twenty (20) days of the first day of such event specifying the matters constituting force majeure, together with such evidence as it reasonably can give, then the party so prevented or delayed will be excused from the performance or punctual performance, as the case may be, as from the date of such notice for so long as such cause of prevention or delay continues. For the purpose of this Agreement, the term \"force majeure\" will be deemed to include an act of God, war, hostilities, riot, fire, explosion, accident, flood or sabotage; lack of adequate fuel, power, raw materials, containers or transportation for reasons beyond such party's reasonable control; labor trouble, strike, lockout or injunction (provided that neither party shall be required to settle a labor dispute against its own best judgment); compliance with governmental laws, regulations, or orders; breakage or failure of machinery or apparatus; or any other cause whether or not of the class or kind enumerated above, including, but not limited to, a severe economic decline or recession, which prevents or materially delays the performance of this Agreement in any material respect arising from or attributable to acts, events, non-happenings, omissions, or accidents beyond the reasonable control of the party affected.\n\nSection 10.9 [Intentionally deleted]\n\nARTICLE 11 - MISCELLANEOUS\n\nSection 11.1 Relationship of the Parties. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties' status with respect to each other shall be, at all times during the term of this Agreement, that of independent contractors retaining complete control over and complete responsibility for their respective operations and employees.

Nothing in this Agreement shall confer, or shall be construed to: (i) confer on the Agent any mutual proprietary interest in, or subject the Agent to any liability for, the business, assets, profits, losses, or obligations associated with Monsanto's manufacture, marketing, distribution and sales of Roundup Products; (ii) otherwise make either party a partner, member, or joint venturer of the other party (A) for purposes of the tax laws of the United States or any other country, or (B) for any other purposes under any other Laws; or (iii) create a franchise relationship between the parties. The parties expressly agree that at no time during the term of this Agreement, shall either party through its officers, directors, agents, employees, independent contractors or other representatives or through their respective representatives on the\n\n54\n\n\n\n\n\nSteering Committee or Global Roundup Team take any action inconsistent with the foregoing expression of the nature of their relationship, except as required pursuant to applicable governmental authority under applicable Law or with the express written consent of the other party. Accordingly, the parties expressly agree to cooperate and communicate with the Steering Committee and the Global Roundup Support Team from time to time and in all events, annually, to ensure that both parties' actions are in compliance with this Section 11.1.\n\nSection 11.2 Interpretation in accordance with GAAP. The parties acknowledge that several terms and concepts (such as various financial and accounting terms and concepts) used or referred to herein are intended to have specific meanings and are intended to be applied in specific ways, but they are not so expressly and fully defined and explained in this Agreement. In order to supplement definitions and other provisions contained in this Agreement and to provide a means for interpreting undefined terms and applying certain concepts, the parties agree that, except as expressly provided herein, when costs are to be determined or other financial calculations are to be made, GAAP as well as the party's past accounting practices shall be used to interpret and determine such terms and to apply such concepts. For example, when actual costs and expenses are referred to herein, they are not intended to contain any margin or profit for the party incurring such costs or expenses.\n\nSection 11.3 Currency. All amounts payable and calculations under this Agreement shall be in United States dollars. As applicable, Program Sales Revenue, Program Expenses, Cost of Goods Sold, Service Costs, and Program EBIT shall be translated into United States dollars at the rate of exchange at which United States dollars are listed in International Financial Statistics (publisher, International Monetary Fund) or if it is not available, The Wall Street Journal for the currency of the country in which the sales were made or the transactions occurred at the average rate of exchange for the Quarter in which such sales were made or transactions occurred.\n\nSection 11.4 Monsanto Obligations.

Subject to Section 6.10(g) of this Agreement, this Agreement, together with all respective exhibits and schedules hereto, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all representations, warranties, understandings, terms or conditions on such subjects that are not set forth herein or therein. Agreements on other subjects, such as security and other credit agreements or arrangements, shall remain in effect according to their terms. The parties recognize that, from time to time, purchase orders, bills of lading, delivery instructions, invoices and similar documentation will be transmitted by each party to the other to facilitate the implementation of this Agreement. Any terms and conditions contained in any of those documents which are inconsistent\n\n55\n\n\n\n\n\nwith the terms of this Agreement shall be null, void and not enforceable. This Agreement is for the benefit of the parties hereto and is not intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder. The provisions of this Agreement shall apply to each division or subsidiary of the Agent and Monsanto and either the Agent or Monsanto may seek enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement on behalf of or with respect to a particular subsidiary or division without changing the rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement as to other aspects of the Agent's or Monsanto's business.\n\nSection 11.7 Modification and Waiver. No conditions, usage of trade, course of dealing, or performance, understanding or agreement purporting to modify, vary, explain or supplement the terms or conditions of the Agreement and no amendment to or modification of this Agreement, and no waiver of any provision hereof, shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by each party hereto. No waiver by either Monsanto or the Agent, with respect to any default or breach or of any right or remedy, and no course of dealing shall be deemed to constitute a continuing waiver of any other breach or default or of any other right or remedy, unless such waiver be expressed in writing signed by the party to be bound.\n\n(a) The parties may, from time to time, enter into Commissionaire and Distributorship Agreements (\"Commissionaire Agreements\") in order to implement this Agreement on a local basis and/or to comply with local legal requirements and, unless a contrary intent is expressly set forth in the Commissionaire Agreements, the terms of the Commissionaire Agreements shall in no way modify, amend, replace or supersede any terms of this Agreement. The parties agree that Section 11.12(b) (but not Section 11.12(a)) of this Agreement shall apply to any dispute arising out of any such Commissionaire Agreements.\n\nSection 11.8 Assignment.\n\n(a) This Agreement and the various rights and obligations arising hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors, and permitted assigns.

On the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company hereby appoints Sandler O'Neill as its Agent to consult with and advise the Company, and to assist the Company with the solicitation of subscriptions and purchase orders for Securities, in connection with the Company's sale of Common Stock in the Offerings. On the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained, and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, Sandler O'Neill accepts such appointment and agrees to use its best efforts to assist the Company with the solicitation of subscriptions and purchase orders for Securities in accordance with this Agreement; provided, however, that the Agent shall not be obligated to take any action which is inconsistent with any applicable laws, regulations, decisions or orders. The services to be rendered by Sandler O'Neill pursuant to this appointment include the following: (i) consulting as to the securities marketing implications of any aspect of the Plans or related corporate documents; (ii) reviewing with the Board of Directors of the Company, the MHCs and the Bank financial and securities marketing implications of the Appraiser's appraisal of the Common Stock; (iii) reviewing all offering documents, including the Prospectus, stock order forms and related offering materials (it being understood that preparation and filing of such documents is the sole responsibility of the Company and the Bank and their counsel); (iv) assisting in the design and implementation of a marketing strategy for the Offerings; (v) assisting management of the Company and the Bank in preparing for meetings with potential investors and broker-dealers; and (vi) providing such other general advice and assistance regarding financial and marketing aspects of the Offering as may be requested to promote the successful completion of the Offering.\n\nThe appointment of the Agent hereunder shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (a) forty-five (45) days after the last day of the Subscription and Community Offering, unless\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\nthe Company and the Agent agree in writing to extend such period and the OTS agrees to extend the period of time in which the Securities may be sold, or (b) the receipt and acceptance of subscriptions and purchase orders for all of the Securities, or (c) the completion of the Syndicated Community Offering.\n\nIf any of the Securities remain available after the expiration of the Subscription and Community Offering, at the request of the Company and the Bank, Sandler O'Neill will seek to form a syndicate of registered brokers or dealers (\"Selected Dealers\") to assist in the solicitation of purchase orders of such Securities on a best efforts basis. Sandler O'Neill will endeavor to limit the aggregate fees to be paid by the Company, the MHCs and the Bank to an amount competitive with gross underwriting discounts charged at such time for underwritings of comparable amounts of stock sold at a comparable price per share in a similar market environment; provided, however, that the aggregate fees payable to Sandler O'Neill and Selected Dealers shall not exceed 6.0% of the aggregate dollar amount of the Securities sold in the Syndicated Community Offering by such Selected Dealers. Sandler O'Neill will endeavor to distribute the Securities among the Selected Dealers in a fashion which best meets the distribution objective of the Company and the Bank, which may result in limiting the allocation of stock to certain Selected Dealers. It is understood that in no event shall Sandler O'Neill be obligated to act as a Selected Dealer or to take or purchase any Securities.\n\nIf any of the Securities remain available after the expiration of the Offerings, the Company agrees to offer the Agent the first right to act as lead managing underwriter for the Public Offering.

This Agreement is not intended to constitute, and should not be construed as, an agreement or commitment between the Company, the Bank and Sandler O'Neill relating to the firm commitment underwriting of any securities, and Sandler O'Neill may, in its sole judgment and discretion, determine at any time not to proceed with the proposed firm commitment underwriting. Such proposed underwriting will be subject, among other things, to: (i) satisfactory completion by Sandler O'Neill of such due diligence investigation or inquiries as it may deem appropriate, (ii) market conditions, which, in the sole judgment of Sandler O'Neill, shall be satisfactory, and (iii) the execution and delivery of a definitive Purchase Agreement.\n\nIn the event the Company is unable to sell at least the total minimum of the Securities, as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus, within the period herein provided, this Agreement shall terminate and the Company shall refund to any persons who have subscribed for any of the Securities the full amount which it may have received from them, together with interest as provided in the Prospectus, and no party to this Agreement shall have any obligation to the others hereunder, except for the obligations of the Company, the MHCs and the Bank as set forth in Sections 4, 6(a) and 7 hereof and the obligations of the Agent as provided in Sections 6(b) and 7 hereof. Appropriate arrangements for placing the funds received from subscriptions for Securities or other offers to purchase Securities in\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\nspecial interest-bearing accounts with the Bank until all Securities are sold and paid for were made prior to the commencement of the Subscription Offering, with provision for refund to the purchasers as set forth above, or for delivery to the Company if all Securities are sold.\n\nIf at least the total minimum of Securities, as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus, are sold, the Company agrees to issue or have issued the Securities sold and to release for delivery certificates for such Securities at the Closing Time against payment therefor by release of funds from the special interest-bearing accounts referred to above. The closing shall be held at the offices of Elias, Matz, Tiernan & Herrick L.L.P., at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Standard Time, or at such other place and time as shall be agreed upon by the parties hereto, on a business day to be agreed upon by the parties hereto. The Company shall notify the Agent by telephone, confirmed in writing, when funds shall have been received for all the Securities. Certificates for Securities shall be delivered directly to the purchasers thereof in accordance with their directions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, certificates for Securities purchased through Selected Dealers shall be made available to the Agent for inspection at least 48 hours prior to the Closing Time at such office as the Agent shall designate. The hour and date upon which the Company shall release for delivery all of the Securities, in accordance with the terms hereof, is herein called the \"Closing Time.\"\n\nThe Company will pay any stock issue and transfer taxes which may be payable with respect to the sale of the Securities.\n\nIn addition to the reimbursement of the expenses specified in Section 4 hereof, the Agent will receive the following compensation for its services hereunder:\n\n(a) One percent (1.00%) of the aggregate purchase price of the Securities sold in the Subscription and Community Offering, excluding in each case shares purchased by (i) any employee benefit plan of the Company or the Bank established for the benefit of their respective directors, officers and employees, and (ii) any director, officer or employee of the Company or the Bank or members of their immediate families (which term shall mean parents, grandparents, spouse, siblings, children and grandchildren); and\n\n(b) With respect to any Securities sold by a National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (\"NASD\") member firm (other than Sandler O'Neill) in the Syndicated Community Offering, (i) the compensation payable to Selected Dealers, (ii) any sponsoring dealer's fees; and (iii) a management fee to Sandler O'Neill of one percent (1.0 %) of the aggregate purchase price of the Securities sold in the Syndicated Community Offering. Any fees payable to Sandler O'Neill for Securities sold by Sandler O'Neill under any such agreement shall be limited to an aggregate of six percent (6.0 %) of the purchase price of the Securities sold by Sandler O'Neill and other NASD member firms.\n\nIf this Agreement is terminated by the Agent in accordance with the provisions of Section 9(a) hereof, no fee shall be payable by the Company to Sandler O'Neill; provided, however, that the Company shall reimburse the Agent for all of its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred prior to termination, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Agent in accordance with the provisions of Section 4 hereof. In addition, the\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany shall be obligated to pay the fees and expenses as contemplated by the provisions of Section 4 hereof in the event of any such termination.\n\nAll fees payable to the Agent hereunder shall be payable in immediately available funds at Closing Time, or upon the termination of this Agreement, as the case may be. In recognition of the long lead times involved in the conversion process, the Bank agreed to make an advance payment to the Agent in the amount of $25,000, all of which has been previously paid, which shall be credited against any fees or reimbursement of expenses payable hereunder. In the event that the advance payment exceeds the amount due in payment of fees and reimbursement of expenses hereunder, the excess shall be refunded.\n\nSECTION 3.

there shall not have occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or elsewhere or any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis

sale of the Securities, and (ii) trading generally on either the American Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market shall not have been suspended, and minimum or maximum prices for trading shall not have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities have been required, by either of said Exchanges or by order of the Commission or any other governmental

INDEMNIFICATION.\n\n(a) The Company, the MHCs and the Bank, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent, each person, if any, who controls the Agent, within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and its respective partners, directors, officers, employees and agents as follows:\n\n(i) from and against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, related to or arising out of the Offerings or any action taken by the Agent where acting as agent of the Company, the MHCs or the Bank or otherwise as described in Section 2 hereof;\n\n(ii) from and against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, based upon or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any Issuer-Represented Free Writing Prospectus, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;\n\n(iii) from and against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever described in clauses (i) or (ii) above, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company, the MHCs or the Bank, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and\n\n(iv) from and against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including, subject to Section 6(c) hereof, the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Agent), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation, proceeding or inquiry by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim pending or threatened whatsoever described in clauses (i) or (ii) above, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above;\n\nprovided, however, that the indemnification provided for in this paragraph (a) shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any Issuer-Represented Free Writing Prospectus, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading which was made in reliance upon and in conformity with the Agent Information.\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) The Agent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the MHCs and the Bank, their directors, each of their officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, of a material fact made in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any Issuer-Represented Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with the Agent Information.\n\n(c) Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to no more than one local counsel in each separate jurisdiction in which any action or proceeding is commenced) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.\n\n(d) The Company, the MHCs and the Bank also agree that the Agent shall not have any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract or tort or otherwise) to the MHCs and its members, the Bank, the Company's, the MHCs's or the Bank's creditors relating to or arising out of the engagement of the Agent pursuant to, or the performance by the Agent of the services contemplated by, this Agreement.\n\n(e) In addition to, and without limiting, the provisions of Section (6)(a)(iv) hereof, in the event that the Agent, any person, if any, who controls the Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act or any of its partners, directors, officers, employees or agents is requested or required to appear as a witness or otherwise gives testimony in any action, proceeding, investigation or inquiry brought by or on behalf of or against the Company, the MHCs, the Bank, the Agent or any of its respective affiliates or any participant in the transactions contemplated hereby in which the Agent or such person or agent is not named as a defendant, the Company, the MHCs, and the Bank, jointly and severally, agree to reimburse the Agent and its partners, directors, officers, employees or agents for all reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with preparing or appearing as a witness or otherwise giving testimony and to compensate the Agent and its partners, directors, officers, employees or agents in an amount to be mutually agreed upon.\n\nSECTION 7. CONTRIBUTION. In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason held to be unenforceable by the indemnified parties although applicable in accordance with its terms, the Company, the MHCs, the Bank, and the Agent shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the Company, the MHCs or the Bank and the Agent, as incurred, in such proportions (i) that the Agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the maximum aggregate\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n\nmarketing fees appearing on the cover page of the Prospectus bears to the maximum aggregate gross proceeds appearing thereon and the Company, the MHCs and the Bank are jointly and severally responsible for the balance or (ii) if, but only if, the allocation provided for in clause (i) is for any reason held unenforceable, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits to the Company, the MHCs and the Bank on the one hand and the Agent on the other, as reflected in clause (i), but also the relative fault of the Company, the MHCs and the Bank on the one hand and the Agent on the other, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided, however, that no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section, each person, if any, who controls the Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Agent, and each director of the Company, the MHCs and the Bank, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company, the MHCs or the Bank within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, the MHCs and the Bank. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, to the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Agent be required to contribute an aggregate amount in excess of the aggregate marketing fees to which the Agent is entitled and actually paid pursuant to this Agreement.\n\nSECTION 8. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS TO SURVIVE DELIVERY. All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, or contained in certificates of officers of the Company, the MHCs or the Bank submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Agent or any controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of the Securities.\n\nSECTION 9. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT.\n\n(a) The Agent may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to Closing Time (i) if there has been, since the date of this Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, any material adverse change in the financial condition, results of operations, business affairs or prospects of the Company, the MHCs or the Bank, considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, (ii) if there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or elsewhere or any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis the effect of which, in the judgment of the Agent, is so material and adverse as to make it impracticable to market the Securities or to enforce contracts, including subscriptions or orders, for the sale of the Securities, (iii) if trading generally on the Nasdaq Global Market, the American Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange has been suspended, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities have been required, by either of said Exchanges or by order of the Commission or any other governmental authority, or if a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal, Pennsylvania or New York authorities, (iv) if any condition specified in Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled when and as required to be fulfilled; (v) if there shall have been such material adverse changes in the condition or prospects of the Company, the MHCs or the Bank or the prospective market for the Company's Securities as in the Agent's\n\n38\n\n\n\n\n\ngood faith opinion would make it inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities; (vi) if, in the Agent's good faith opinion, the price for the Securities established by the Appraiser is not reasonable or equitable under then prevailing market conditions, or (vii) if the Offerings are not consummated on or prior to June 30, 2007.\n\n(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Sections 2 and 4 hereof relating to the reimbursement of expenses and except that the provisions of Sections 6 and 7 hereof shall survive any termination of this Agreement.\n\nSECTION 10. NOTICES. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication.

Developer desires to obtain development rights for multiple restaurants under the El Pollo Loco\u00ae System (each, an \"El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant\") from Franchisor within a specified geographical (the \"Territory\") specified in Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto and made a part hereof (or if single unit, replace with \"Developer desires to obtain development rights for a single restaurant under the El Pollo Loco\u00ae System (each, an \"El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant\") from Franchisor within a specified address (the \"Territory\") specified in Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto and made a part hereof.\")\n\nD.Franchisor is willing to grant the (non-exclusive/exclusive) right to develop and open El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant(s) within the Territory referenced in Exhibit \"A.\"\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and obligations herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n\n1.Development Rights in Territory.\n\n1.1. Franchisor hereby grants to Developer, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (if Section 2.20 is applicable add \", and specifically Section 2.20 hereof,\") and as long as Developer shall not be in default of this Agreement or any other development, franchise or other agreement between Developer and Franchisor, (non-exclusive/exclusive) development rights to establish and operate ____ franchised restaurant(s), and to use the El Pollo Loco\u00ae System solely in connection therewith, at specific locations to be designated in separate Franchise Agreement(s) (the \"Franchise Agreements\"). (If exclusive agreement, add \"Developer expressly acknowledges that the exclusive rights granted herein apply only to the right to develop new restaurants in the Territory, and no exclusive territory or radius protection for the term of any Franchise Agreement is granted herein and any such protection shall be set forth in the particular Franchise Agreement to be signed.\") The Franchise Agreements (and all ancillary documents attached as Exhibits to the Franchise Agreement, including the Personal Guarantee) executed in accordance with this Agreement shall be in the form currently in use by Franchisor at the time of execution of the Franchise Agreement and shall be executed individually by each person, partner, member or shareholder.\n\n1.2. (Only applies if exclusive Agreement. Delete if non-exclusive Agreement.) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions of Section 2.20 hereof, after the date of this\n\nSource: EL POLLO LOCO HOLDINGS, INC., 10-K, 3/6/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nAgreement and during the term of this Agreement, and so long as Developer is in compliance with its obligations under this Agreement, Franchisor shall neither, without Developer's prior written consent: (i) grant development rights to anyone else with respect to the Territory or any part of the Territory; nor (ii) establish or franchise any person to establish an El Pollo Loco restaurant under the Marks and System at any location within the Territory. Franchisor expressly retains all other rights and may, among other things, on any terms and conditions Franchisor deems advisable, and without granting Developer any rights therein:\n\na. Establish and operate or franchise others to establish and operate an El Pollo Loco restaurant located outside of the Territory;\n\nb. Sell the same or similar products (whether or not using the Marks), as will be sold by Developer in a developed El Pollo Loco restaurant, to customers at any retail location (whether within or outside of the Territory), through any method or channel of distribution, including, without limitation, at retail locations such as grocery or convenience stores and via the Internet, telemarketing and direct marketing means, through other non-El-Pollo Loco restaurants having the same or similar menu items, or through any other distribution channel;\n\nc. Establish and operate or franchise others to establish and operate restaurants (not using the Marks) having the same or similar menu items whether within or outside of the Territory; and\n\nd. Any continued operation by Franchisor, or the allowance of any continued operation by a franchisee of Franchisor, of an El Pollo Loco restaurant within the Territory which was opened on or before the date of this Agreement shall not be considered to constitute a breach of this Agreement.\n\n1.3. (Only applies to multi-unit Development Agreement - delete if single-unit Development Agreement). Prior to or concurrent with the execution of this Agreement, Developer shall meet with Franchisor's development representatives and prepare a market development plan for the units to be constructed and opened by Developer in the Territory (identifying specific key areas, key intersections and trade areas in the Territory) and all development pursuant to this Agreement shall be in accordance with this plan (the \"Market Plan\"). The Market Plan shall include proposed areas where sites may be located, ranking and prioritization of site locations and other information customarily used by market planners in the restaurant industry. Developer and Franchisor shall jointly approve the Market Plan.\n\n2. Limitation on Development Rights.\n\n2.1. Developer must submit one or more site(s) for approval, enter into binding leases or purchase agreements and open to the public the number of El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant(s) on such approved sites each calendar year as required on the Development Schedule, all as set forth on Exhibit \"B\" attached hereto and made a part hereof.\n\n2.2. For purposes of the Development Schedule in Exhibit \"B\", no credit will be given for the development of El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant(s) outside the Territory, regardless of the fact that Developer may, upon proper application, obtain from Franchisor an El Pollo Loco\u00ae Franchise Agreement (\"Franchise Agreement\") for any such development.\n\n2.3. Although this Agreement affords the Developer the right to develop and open El Pollo Loco\u00ae restaurant(s) within the Territory, as set forth on Exhibit \"A\", all Restaurant(s) developed under this Agreement must be duly licensed through individual Franchise Agreement(s). Developer will execute El Pollo Loco's then standard Franchise Agreement in use at the time of execution for each restaurant developed under this Agreement, and agrees to pay Franchisor the current fees, royalties and other required payments in accordance with the Franchise Agreement and Franchise Disclosure Document then in effect. Execution of the appropriate Franchise Agreement and payment of the initial franchise fee and/or any other required fees must be accomplished prior to the commencement of construction at any site.\n\n2.4. Developer must satisfy all Franchisor's financial and operational criteria then in effect and in addition, if Developer is also a Franchisee of one or more El Pollo Loco Restaurants, Franchisee must also be in good standing with Franchisor and satisfy all Franchisor's financial and operational criteria then in effect prior to El Pollo Loco's execution of each standard Franchise Agreement issued pursuant to this Agreement. Developer shall provide Franchisor with current information pertaining to Developer's financial condition and the financial condition of the majority and managing members/partners/shareholders of Developer at any time upon El Pollo Loco's request and in no event less than once annually. Developer acknowledges that, among other things, it will be\n\nSource: EL POLLO LOCO HOLDINGS, INC., 10-K, 3/6/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nrequired to submit annual financial statements of Developer and personal financial statements of each of its principal owners and Managing Members to be eligible for financial approval by El Pollo Loco. In the event any of the majority owners of Developer shall also be the Managing Members and/or majority owners of any other entity which is a franchisee of El Pollo Loco, then each such franchisee entity must be operationally and financially approved by Franchisor before approval for expansion will be granted to any one franchisee entity. \"Managing Members\" shall be any individuals who are designated as the primary decision makers or general managers of the franchisee entity and those individuals who (individually or collectively) own at least 51% interest in the franchisee entity.\n\n2.5. Developer shall use its best efforts to retain qualified real estate professionals (including licensed brokers) to locate proposed sites for the El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant(s). Developer shall submit proposed sites for each El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant unit to be developed under this Agreement for acceptance by Franchisor's Real Estate Site Approval Committee (\"RESAC\"), together with such site information as may be reasonably required by Franchisor to evaluate the proposed site, no later than the dates set forth in Exhibit \"B\" as RESAC Submittal Dates, the first of which shall be approximately ninety (90) days after execution of this Agreement. Should the site be accepted by RESAC, it will be referred to as the \"Approved Site\". Such acceptance will expire one (1) year from the RESAC approval date. Franchisor may require, as a condition to its approval of a site, a \"Market Study\", which shall include a site description and analysis, traffic and other demographic information and an analysis of the impact of the proposed site on other company owned and franchised El Pollo Loco restaurants surrounding or within the vicinity of such proposed site all in such format as the Franchisor may require. All such analyses, information and studies shall be prepared at the sole cost and expense of Developer.\n\n2.6. Franchisor shall send representatives to evaluate proposed site(s) for each El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant to be developed under this Agreement, and Franchisor will do so at its own expense for the first two (2) proposed sites for each El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant. If Developer proposes, and Franchisor evaluates, more than two (2) sites for each El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant, then Developer shall reimburse Franchisor for the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Franchisor's representatives in connection with the evaluation of such additional proposed site(s), including, without limitation, the costs of lodging, travel, meals and wages.\n\n2.7. Provided there exists no default by Developer under this Agreement or any other development, franchise or other agreement between Franchisor and Developer, Franchisor shall evaluate each site proposed for which Developer has provided all necessary evaluation information, and shall promptly after receipt of Developer's proposal, send to Developer written notice of acceptance or non-acceptance of the sit\n\n2.8. If RESAC determines through its evaluation of the proposed site that the proposed site may impact sales at any company-owned El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant, Franchisor has the sole and absolute right to accept or reject the proposed site, without any obligation to discuss a possible resolution with Developer. However, Franchisor may elect to discuss with Developer a possible resolution with regard to the proposed site; however, if such an agreement cannot be reached, Franchisor has the sole and absolute right to reject the proposed site. If RESAC determines through its evaluation of the proposed site that the proposed site may potentially impact sales at any existing El Pollo Loco\u00ae franchisee's restaurant, Franchisor shall notify Developer of the existing El Pollo Loco\u00ae franchisees' location(s) and contact information. If nevertheless Developer wishes to try to proceed with that site, Developer must obtain a written waiver from those existing El Pollo Loco\u00ae franchisees of any claims they might have against Developer and Franchisor with respect to the proposed new El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant. Such waiver, if obtained, must be submitted along with the evaluation information required pursuant to this Section.\n\n2.9. No later than the Site Commitment Dates set forth in Exhibit \"B\", Developer shall submit for the Approved Site to Franchisor for its review and approval of:\n\na. A fully negotiated but unexecuted lease, which may only subject to obtaining necessary governmental permits. The unexecuted form of the lease must be submitted to Franchisor to review for the required terms and conditions listed in Sections 2.9, 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12 below prior to full execution of the lease. Franchisor will promptly notify Developer upon their approval of the inclusion of such required terms and conditions. Developer will promptly then provide a final executed copy of the lease to Franchisor; or\n\nb. A purchase agreement. Should Developer purchase the site using another entity other than the franchise entity, Developer must then enter into a lease with the Franchise entity as the lessee and the purchasing entity as the lessor and must comply with all the requirements of this Sections 2.9, 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12 below).\n\n2.10. Any lease to be entered into by Developer shall include the terms and conditions set forth below and in a form approved by Franchisor:\n\nSource: EL POLLO LOCO HOLDINGS, INC., 10-K, 3/6/2020\n\n\n\n\n\na. The tenant entity on the lease must match the franchise entity on the franchise agreement; and\n\nb. The term (with renewal options) of the lease must match at least the initial term of the franchise agreement; and\n\nc. The landlord consents to your use of the premises as an El Pollo Loco\u00ae restaurant which will be open during the required days and hours set out in the Operations Manual.\n\n2.11. Franchisor shall have no liability under any lease or purchase agreement for any El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant location developed under this Agreement and shall not guarantee Developer's obligations thereunder. Upon approval by Franchisor of the form of Developer's lease and execution of a lease for a site by Developer, Developer shall furnish to Franchisor a fully executed copy of such lease and any amendments thereto within fifteen (15) calendar days of such execution. Franchisor shall have no obligation to assist Developer to negotiate its leases.\n\n2.12. The lease or deed may not contain a non-competition covenant which restricts Franchisor or any franchisee or licensee of Franchisor, from operating an El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant or any other retail restaurant, unless such covenant is approved by Franchisor in writing prior to the execution by Developer of the lease.\n\n2.13. Each subsequent site to be developed pursuant to the Development Schedule shall be submitted for approval by RESAC by the date set forth in Exhibit \"B\". Similarly, each fully executed lease (executed upon prior review and approval by Franchisor) or purchase agreement (with all contingencies to Developer's obligations waived or satisfied, except permitting contingencies) relating to each subsequent Approved Site shall: (1) be delivered to Franchisor on or before the Site Commitment Date for each respective El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant as set forth in Exhibit \"B\" and (2) prior to the execution of your Franchise Agreements (3) prior to the payment of your initial Franchise Fees for each site and (4) prior to the commencement of construction of the El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant.\n\n2.14. RESAC site approval does not assure that a Franchise Agreement will be executed. Execution of the Franchise Agreement is contingent upon Developer completing the purchase or lease of the proposed site within sixty (60) days after approval of the site by the Franchisor or no later than the dates set forth in Exhibit \"B\" as Site Committment Dates.\n\n2.15. Developer acknowledges that time is of the essence in this Agreement. If Developer has not obtained approval and entered into a binding lease or purchase agreement for each site for El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant(s) to be developed under this Agreement by the applicable Site Commitment Date, Developer shall be in default of its obligations under the Development Schedule and Franchisor shall be entitled to exercise its rights and remedies under this Agreement, up to and including termination of this Agreement.\n\n2.16. Developer also acknowledges that it is required pursuant to this Agreement to open El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurants in the future pursuant to dates set forth in the Development Schedule attached as Exhibit \"B\". If Developer fails to meet the opening date for any El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant to be developed under this Agreement, Developer shall be in default and Franchisor shall be entitled to exercise all rights and remedies available to Franchisor set forth in Section 11. Developer acknowledges that if Developer fails to open El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurants in a timely manner pursuant to the Development Schedule, Franchisor will suffer lost revenues, including royalties and other fees which would be difficult to calculate and which Franchisor would have received had Developer met the agreed schedule or had Franchisor had the right to grant development rights to others in the Territory.\n\n2.17. Developer acknowledges that the estimated initial investment and estimated expenses set forth in Items 6 and 7 of our Franchise Disclosure Document are subject to and likely to increase over time, and that future El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurants will likely involve a greater initial investment and operating capital requirements than those stated in the Franchise Disclosure Document provided to you prior to your execution of this Agreement.\n\n2.18. Developer understands and acknowledges that in accepting Developer's proposed site or by granting a franchise for each approved site, Franchisor does not in any way, endorse, warrant or guarantee either directly or indirectly the suitability of such site or the success of the franchise business to be operated by Developer at such site. The suitability of the site and the success of the franchise business depend upon a number of factors outside of Franchisor's control, including, but not limited to, the Developer's operational abilities, site location, consumer trends and such other factors that are within the direct control of the Developer. Source: EL POLLO LOCO HOLDINGS, INC., 10-K, 3/6/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n2.19. The purpose of this Agreement is to promote orderly incremental growth within the El Pollo Loco\u00ae System. The acquisition of existing El Pollo Loco\u00ae restaurants by Developer does not represent incremental growth and, therefore, does not satisfy the terms of this Agreement pertaining to development.\n\n2.20. (To be added where there are existing restaurants in the Territory) Developer acknowledges that Franchisor (i) is operating or has franchised another to operate, one (1) or more restaurants in the Territory or (ii) has granted franchise rights to another in the Territory or (iii) approved a new site for development for those locations identified in Exhibit \"C\" attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference. Developer further acknowledges that Franchisor retains the sole and absolute right to approve or disapprove any proposed location for development under this Agreement if, in Franchisor's reasonable judgment: (i) such proposed location is not suitable for an El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant or (ii) such proposed location will have a material adverse effect on the profitability of another existing El Pollo Loco\u00ae location (or approved site) in the Territory. Developer covenants to use its reasonable best efforts to avoid selecting proposed locations that would adversely impact pre-existing locations in the Territory.\n\n3. Development Fee.\n\n3.1. Developer shall pay to Franchisor upon execution of this Agreement a non-refundable Development Fee (the \"Development Fee\") equal to Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000) in immediately available funds, for each El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant to be developed under this Agreement. The Development Fee is consideration for this Agreement. The Development Fee is not consideration for any Franchise Agreement and is non-refundable. The $20,000 Development Fee for each El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant shall be applied against the initial franchise fee payable upon the execution of the Franchise Agreement applicable to such El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant. As a benefit of signing the Development Agreement, the Initial Fee for the second and each subsequent restaurant developed under the same Development Agreement will be reduced by us to $30,000. As an example, the Initial Fee for the first restaurant developed under a Development Agreement would be $40,000 to which $20,000 (from the Development Fee will be credited. The Initial Fee for the second and remaining restaurants developed under the same Development Agreement would be $30,000, to which $20,000 from the Development Fee will be credited. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 10 or 11 below, Developer will lose its right to develop and Development Fee.\n\n4. Term of Development Agreement.\n\n4.1. This Agreement shall commence on the date specified in Exhibit \"B\". Unless terminated pursuant to Section 10 or 11 below, it shall expire upon the earlier of the date specified in Exhibit \"B\" or upon the opening of the last El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant listed in the Development Schedule.\n\n5. Territory Conflicts.\n\n5.1. The rights granted Developer in this Agreement are subject to any prior territorial rights of other franchisees which may now exist in the Territory, whether or not those rights are currently being enforced. In the event of a conflict in territorial rights, whether under a Franchise Agreement or separate territorial or development agreement, Developer shall be free to negotiate with any person, corporation or other entity, which claims territorial rights adverse to the rights granted under this Agreement, for the assignment of those prior territorial rights. For this purpose, Franchisor agrees to approve any such assignment not in conflict with the other terms of this Agreement, subject to the condition of any Franchise Agreements involved, and current policies pertaining to assignments, including, but not limited to, satisfaction of all past due debts owed to Franchisor and the execution of a General Release.\n\n5.2. In the event of third party claims of the right to develop the Territory, it is the sole responsibility of El Pollo Loco, where the right granted herein is exclusive, to protect and maintain Developer's right to the development of the Territory. However, if it appears to El Pollo Loco, as its sole and absolute right to determine, that protection of the Territory by legal action is not advisable, whether due to the anticipation of, or the actual protracted nature of the action, the costs involved, the uncertainty of outcome, or otherwise, Franchisor has the right to terminate this Agreement, provided that it refunds to Developer the balance, if any, of the Development Fee made pursuant to Section 3, which has not been applied against the initial franchise fees for Franchise Agreement(s) to be acquired under this Agreement.\n\n6. Proprietary Rights of El Pollo Loco. Source: EL POLLO LOCO HOLDINGS, INC., 10-K, 3/6/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1. Developer expressly acknowledges El Pollo Loco's exclusive right, title, and interest in an to the trade name, service mark and trademark \"El Pollo Loco\", and such other trade names, service marks, and trademarks which are designated as part of the El Pollo Loco\u00ae System (the \"Marks\"), and Developer agrees not to represent in any manner that Developer has any ownership in El Pollo Loco\u00ae Marks. This Agreement is not a Franchise Agreement. Developer may not open an El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant or use the El Pollo Loco\u00ae Marks at a particular site until it executes a Franchise Agreement for that site. Developer's use of the El Pollo Loco\u00ae Marks shall be limited to those rights granted under each individual Franchise Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, El Pollo Loco\u00ae may authorize Developer in writing to use the Marks in connection with advertising and marketing activities in connection with this Agreement. Developer expressly agrees that such usage is limited to those specific activities or promotional materials approved by El Pollo Loco's marketing department in advance. Developer further agrees that its use of the Marks shall not create in its favor any right, title, or interest in or to El Pollo Loco\u00ae Marks, but that all of such use shall inure to the benefit of El Pollo Loco, and Developer has no rights to the Marks except to the degree specifically granted by the individual Franchise Agreement(s). Building designs and specifications, color schemes and combinations, sign design specifications, and interior building layouts (including equipment, equipment specification, equipment layouts, and interior color schemes and combinations) are acknowledged by Developer to comprise part of the El Pollo Loco\u00ae System. Developer shall have no right to license or franchise others to use the Marks by virtue of this Agreement.\n\n6.2. Developer acknowledges that, in connection with its execution of this Agreement, it may receive confidential and proprietary information regarding the El Pollo Loco\u00ae System, including but not limited to the El Pollo Loco Operational Manual. Developer recognizes the unique value and secondary meaning attached to the El Pollo Loco\u00ae Marks and the El Pollo Loco\u00ae System, and Developer agrees that any noncompliance with the terms of this Agreement or any unauthorized or improper use will cause irreparable damage to Franchisor and its franchisees. Developer, therefore, agrees that if it should engage in any such unauthorized or improper use during, or after, the term of this Agreement, Franchisor shall be entitled to both seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in addition to any other remedies prescribed by law.\n\n6.3. Developer acknowledges that it will receive one (1) copy of the Operations Manual on loan from Franchisor and that the Operations Manual shall at all times remain the sole property of the Franchisor.\n\n7. Insurance and Indemnification.\n\n7.1. Throughout the term of this Agreement, Developer shall obtain and maintain insurance coverage for public liability, including products liability, in the amount of at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) combined single limit. Developer also shall carry such worker's compensation insurance as may be required by applicable law.\n\n7.2. Franchisor shall be named as an additional insured on all such insurance policies and shall be provided with certificates of insurance evidencing such coverage. All public liability and property damage policies shall contain a provision that El Pollo Loco, although named as an insured, shall nevertheless be entitled to recover under such policies on any loss incurred by El Pollo Loco, its affiliates, agents and/or employees, by reason of the negligence of Developer, its principals, contractors, agents and/or employees. All policies shall provide Franchisor with at least thirty (30) days' notice of cancellation or termination of coverage.\n\n7.3. Franchisor reserves the right to specify reasonable changes in the types and amounts of insurance coverage required by this Section 7. In the event that Developer fails or refuses to obtain or maintain the required insurance coverage from an insurance carrier acceptable to El Pollo Loco, Franchisor may, as its sole and absolute right and without any obligations to do so, procure such coverage for Developer. In such event, Developer shall pay the required premiums or reimburse such premiums to Franchisor upon written demand.\n\n7.4. Developer shall defend immediately upon tender of defense, at its own cost, the Franchisor, its subsidiaries, parent and affiliates, shareholders, directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively for this section only known as \"Franchisor\"), from and against any and all claims, lawsuits, complaints, cross complaints, arbitrations, demands, allegations, costs embraced by indemnity, loss, costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees), liens and damages (collectively for this section only known as \"Losses\"), however caused, and reimburse Franchisor for all costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by the Franchisor in defense of any Losses, resulting directly or indirectly from or pertaining to or arising out of, or alleged to arise out of, or in connection with Developer's activities under the Development Agreement, including any labor, any employee related claims whatsoever, including, without limitation any claims made by an employee of Developer resulting from the employee's training in a Franchisor operated facility or restaurant, and including Developer's failure for\n\nSource: EL POLLO LOCO HOLDINGS, INC., 10-K, 3/6/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nany reason to fully inform any third party of Developer's lack of authority to bind the Franchisor for any purpose. Such Losses shall include, without limitation, those arising from the death of or injury to any person or arising from damage to the property of Developer or the Franchisor, or any third person, firm or corporation, whether or not resulting from any strict liability imposed by fact, law, statute, or ordinance, on the Franchisor. Developer further agrees that Developer's duty to defend the Franchisor is separate from, independent of and free-standing of Developer's duty to indemnify the Franchisor and applies whether the issue of Developer's negligence, breach of contract, or other fault or obligation has been determined. Developer's duty to defend is regardless of the outcome of liability even if Developer is ultimately found not negligent and not dependent on the ultimate resolution of issues arising out of any claims, lawsuits, complaints, cross complaints, arbitration, demands, allegations, costs embraced by indemnity, loss, costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees), liens or damages.\n\n7.5. Developer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Franchisor (as defined above) from and against any and all Losses (as defined above), however caused, resulting directly or indirectly from or pertaining to or arising out of or in connection with Developer's activities under the Development Agreement, including any labor, any employee related claims whatsoever, including, without limitation any claims made by an employee of Developer resulting from the employee's training in a Franchisor operated facility or restaurant, and including Developer's failure for any reason to fully inform any third party of Developer's lack of authority to bind the Franchisor for any purpose. Such Losses shall include, without limitation, those arising from latent or other defects in the restaurant whether or not discoverable by Franchisor, and those arising from the death of or injury to any person or arising from damage to the property of Developer or the Franchisor, or any third person, firm or corporation, whether or not resulting from any strict liability imposed by fact, law, statute, or ordinance, on the Franchisor. Developer further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Franchisor from all said Losses and shall pay for and be responsible for all said Losses, however caused, whether by any individual, employee, third person or party, vendor, visitor, invitee, trespasser or any firm or corporation whatsoever, whether caused by or contributed to by Franchisor, the combined conduct of Developer and Franchisor, or active or passive negligence of Franchisor, but for the sole negligence or willful misconduct of Franchisor.\n\n7.6. The provisions of this Section 7 shall expire as to each El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant to be developed under this Agreement upon execution of a Franchise Agreement for such El Pollo Loco\u00ae Restaurant. The provision of the Franchise Agreement, in particular, Section 9 thereof (insurance and Indemnification) shall supersede this Section 7 and govern the rights and obligations of the parties prospectively.\n\n8. Transfer of Rights.\n\n8.1. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of Franchisor and its successors and assigns, and is fully assignable by El Pollo Loco.\n\n8.2. The parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement is personal in nature with respect to Developer, being entered into by Franchisor in reliance upon and in consideration of the personal skills, qualifications and trust and confidence reposed in Developer and Developer's present partners, managing members or officers if Developer is a partnership, a limited liability company or a corporation. Therefore, the rights, privileges and interests of Developer under this Agreement shall not be assigned, sold, transferred, leased, divided or encumbered, voluntarily or involuntarily, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of El Pollo Loco, which consent may be given or withheld as El Pollo Loco's sole and absolute right. For purposes of this Section, a sale of stock, or any membership or partnership interest in Developer, or a merger or other combination of Developer shall be considered a transfer of Developer's interest prohibited hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Developer shall be permitted to assign business organizations to serve as Franchisee after Developer individually executes the Franchise Agreements, provided the ownership mirrors that of Developer (e.g., Developer consists of persons A (50%), B (25%) and C (25%). Franchisee also must be owned and controlled by the same three (3) persons with each retaining the same percentage of ownership). All other entity structures shall require the prior written approval of Franchisor. Developer shall pay an administrative fee of Five Hundred Dollars ($500) per transfer for each permitted transfer to an Entity where such transfer is for the convenience of ownership only and does not involve a change of principals of the business. Where Developer desires to add new principals to the Developer or any Franchisee entity, Developer shall pay to Franchisor an additional Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500) per new principal to cover Franchisor's administrative costs for reviewing the application and suitability of each new principal as participants in the franchise business.\n\n9.

In addition, Developer covenants that, except as otherwise approved in writing by the Franchisor, Developer shall not, for a continuous, uninterrupted period commencing upon the expiration, termination or assignment of this Agreement, regardless of the cause for termination, and continuing for two (2) years thereafter, either directly or indirectly, for itself, or through or on behalf of, or in conjunction with any person, partnership, corporation or other entity, own, operate, control or have any financial interest in any Competitive Business which is located or has outlets or restaurant units within the Territory.

If the disclosing party elects not to seek, or is unsuccessful in obtaining, any such protective order or similar remedy and if the receiving party receives advice from reputable legal counsel confirming that the disclosure of Confidential Information is required pursuant to applicable law, then the receiving party may disclose such Confidential Information to the extent required; provided, however, that the receiving party will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such Confidential Information is treated confidentially by each party to which it is disclosed.\n\n15.

Bioamber and Cargill shall be referred to individually as \"Party\" and collectively as \"Parties\", as required by text.\n\nBackground\n\n\n\n\n\nCargill and Bioamber mutually agree as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Cargill Confidential   - 1 -   * Confidential treatment requested\n\n  A. Cargill has developed a yeast strain designated CB1 (\"CB1\") for fermenting dextrose and/or mixed sugar streams and related research  tools for modifying CB1,which are protected by Licensed Patents (as defined in Section 2.5 below).\n\n  B. Bioamber desires to engage Cargill to further develop or modify CB1 with the goal of fermenting dextrose and/or mixed sugar streams to  produce succinic acid and salts thereof.\n\n  C. The Parties desire to grant each other certain rights to use the further developed or modified CB1 as well as other technology that is  developed in the course of the work as provided in this Development Agreement for research purposes only.\n\n1. Scope of Work Plan  1.1 Cargill agrees to perform the services to develop or modify CB1 to produce succinic acid and salts thereof using dextrose (defined as  glucose) and/or sucrose as the fermentation feedstock (\"Work Plan\"). The Work Plan is more fully described in Exhibit A, which is hereby  incorporated by reference into this Development Agreement. CB1 that has been further developed or modified (or the like) under the Work  Plan shall be referred to as \"Modified CB1\". Any changes to the Work Plan must be in writing and signed by both Cargill and Bioamber and  may be subject to incremental fees depending on resource requirements.\n\n1.2 In agreeing to perform the Work Plan, Cargill represents and warrants that:\n\n  1.2.1 Cargill has the capability, experience, and means necessary to perform the Work Plan, and the Work Plan will be performed using  personnel, equipment, and material qualified and suitable to perform the Work Plan requested;\n\nth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Cargill Confidential   - 2 -   * Confidential treatment requested\n\n  1.2.2 Cargill will provide properly trained and informed personnel, and Cargill will be solely responsible for the negligent acts, errors and  omissions of its employees, subcontractors, and agents and for any other person performing services under this Development  Agreement at the direct request of Cargill;\n\n  1.2.3 Cargill will perform the Work Plan in a workmanlike manner with reasonable skill and care ordinarily exercised by members of the  profession practicing under similar conditions and in accordance with accepted industry practices and professional guidelines;\n\n  1.2.4 Subject to Section 13.1, Cargill has in effect and will maintain in effect all permits, licenses and other authorizations necessary to  perform the Work Plan; and\n\n\n\n1.2.5 No other party has rights to its services as described in the Work Plan, and that a work assignment from any third party shall not be  accepted, or work by Cargill aloneshall not be conducted, to develop CB1 or other microorganisms that will be used to (a) directly  produce succinic acid and salts thereof, or (b) indirectly produce succinic acid and salts thereof (for example, Cargill may develop  microorganisms to produce precursors of succinic acid, such as fumaric acid and malic acid, so long as such precursors are not  converted to succinic acid, such as by chemical modification), for the Term (as defined in Section 10.1) of this Development  Agreement. For purposes of clarity, and as examples, Cargill may sell dextrose as fermentation feedstock to third parties, who may  use such dextrose to produce succinic acid; also, Cargill may modify starches to make succinic acid starch derivatives.\n\n2. Fees and Milestones   2.1 Bioamber shall pay Cargill Two Hundred Fifty Thousand U.S. Dollars ($250,000.00) within thirty (30) days of the execution of this  Development Agreement.\n\n2.2 In addition to the payment in Section 2.1, Bioamber shall pay Cargill a total of [***] U.S. Dollars ($[***] per year per full-time equivalent  (FTE) person to perform the Work Plan, and Cargill will make available up to [***] FTE persons per year to perform the work as outlined in  the Work Plan. Such total is subject to change based on an annual review of the needs and requirements of the Work Plan. The actual  number of FTEs assigned at any given time will be a function of the Work Plan and will be subject to agreement amongst the Parties. In  addition, Bioamber will pay for reasonable expenses incurred by Cargill, including travel. Cargill shall cover ordinary and customary [***].  Cargill shall submit to Bioamber a monthly invoice for costs owed by Bioamber, accompanied by a report summarizing Cargill's activities in  relation to actual hours worked and expenses incurred. Bioamber will pay Cargill's costs within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoice and  supporting documentation. Bioamber shall have the right to audit Cargill time sheets from time to time. Such audit shall occur once per year  during reasonable business hours by an independent third party agreed to by both parties, who shall be under obligations of  confidentiality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Cargill Confidential   - 3 -   * Confidential treatment requested\n\n2.3 Bioamber shall also pay Cargill within thirty (30) days of achieving each of the milestones summarized below and more fully described in the  Work Plan found in Exhibit A. For purposes of clarity, payment is triggered [***]. Further, each of the Milestones and Target Dates may be  changed according to the needs of the Work Plan and upon written agreement by the parties.\n\nMilestone   Target Date   Payment  Milestone 1: Proof of Concept   12 months after Effective Date   US $250,000.00 Milestone 2: CB1 Strain Development   30 months after Effective Date   US $300,000.00 Milestone 3: CB1 Strain Optimization   42 months after Effective Date   US $500,000.00\n\n2.4 Missed Milestones.\n\n\n\n2.4.1 In the event Cargill does not achieve a given Milestone provided in Section 2.3 by the Target Date listed in Section 2.3 or modified  Milestone and modified Target Date as agreed to by the Parties, and subsequently achieves such milestone as per the criteria  described in Exhibit A, the payment for such missed milestone shall be due [***] and the amount due shall be [***] for every [***]  beyond the Target Date. The Target Date for subsequent Milestones will be adjusted to reflect the date on which the Milestone was  actually achieved. If a subsequent Milestone is achieved by the original Target Date listed in Section 2.3, Bioamber will pay Cargill  the amount [***]. For purposes of clarity and as examples, if Milestones 1 and 2 were not delivered by the Target Dates, but  Milestone 3 is delivered by or before the Target Date, then the total payments due to Cargill at that time would be [***] (a total  payment of $[***]). Another example is if [***], the payment due at that time would be a total of $[***].\n\n\n\n2.4.2 In the event Cargill does not achieve a given Milestone provided in Section 2.3 by the Target Date listed in Section 2.3 or modified  Milestone and modified Target Date as agreed to by the Parties, and Bioamber decides to commercialize Modified CB1, any  outstanding milestone payments shall immediately become due such that the total payment due Cargill under this Development  Agreement equals One Million Fifty Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $1,050,000.00).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Cargill Confidential   - 4 -   * Confidential treatment requested\n\n  2.4.3 Provided that Cargill has respected its undertakings set out in Section 1.2 of this Development Agreement, no other damages shall  accrue to Cargill for not achieving a given Milestone other than provided in Sections 2.4.1, 2.4.2, and 2.5.\n\n2.5 Option to Research License. In the event Cargill (i) is unable to achieve a given milestone described in Section 2.3 by the Target Date, or (ii)  terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.2, Bioamber shall have the option to obtain a license during the term of this Development  Agreement to the patent applications and patents listed in Exhibit B (including any continuations, continued prosecutions, continuations- in-part, reissues, reexaminations, divisions or substitutions thereof) (collectively \"Licensed Patents\"), the tool kit listed in Exhibit C  (\"Licensed Tool Kit\"), and Cargill Improvements if any (as defined in Section 5.2 below), for research use only and for additional monetary  consideration (\"Research License\"). Except for financial terms paid by third parties for [***], the Research License shall be offered to  Bioamber at [***]. Such research use shall be for the development and optimization of CB1 for the production of succinic acid and salts  thereof using dextrose or sucrose as the fermentation feedstock. The Research License shall be provided to Bioamber only, with no rights  to sublicense and with no \"have made\" rights. Notwithstanding the preceding, Bioamber will be permitted to outsource development work  as outlined in the Work Plan and according to the Research License to third parties that have been approved by Cargill, and such approval  shall not be unreasonably withheld. In considering whether or not to outsource such development work to third parties, the Parties  recognize that it is in their mutual interest to protect CB1, Modified CB1, Cargill Confidential Information (as defined in Section 4.1), and  Know-How and Licensed Patents (as those terms are defined under the Commercial License Agreement) and, therefore, the Parties shall  undertake joint evaluations of third parties who have been identified by Bioamber to perform such development work, including, for  example and not by limitation, a risk assessment of the geography in which such development work will occur, and whether or not such  third parties have similar guiding principles as Cargill (a copy of Cargill's Guiding Principles and Compliance Policy on Intellectual Property  is attached as Exhibit F). Such development work shall not be conducted by such third parties in circumstances where Cargill's intellectual  property is at an unacceptable risk as determined by Cargill based on the joint evaluations of such third parties. The terms and conditions  of such Research License shall be negotiated between the Parties and shall include the terms described in this Section 2.5 and terms  addressing ownership and rights to use of any intellectual property developed. Further, this Development Agreement shall serve as the  framework for the Research License.\n\n2.6 Technology Transfer. In the event Milestone 3 is achieved, Cargill will provide up to [***] to assist in a successful transfer of the Modified  CB1 technology to Bioamber in order to allow subsequent scale-up at the same FTE rate set forth in Section 2.2. For clarity, [***] per FTE  per year equals US$[***] for this technology transfer).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Cargill Confidential   - 5 -   * Confidential treatment requested\n\n2.7 Scale-Up. Following the successful technology transfer, upon request by Bioamber and subject to Cargill's availability of appropriate  resources, Cargill will enter at its sole discretion into a services agreement with Bioamber to assist in the fermentation scale-up of using  Modified CB1 obtained under Milestones 2 and 3 for producing succinic acid and salts thereof at a single Bioamber facility or a facility  designated by Bioamber. Cargill shall invoice Bioamber [***] U.S. Dollars (US$[***]) per man-day provided, not inclusive of taxes or other  governmental fees, and further adjusted for inflation at the time it goes into effect. Cargill shall have no obligation to perform scale-up work  at Cargill facilities.\n\n3. Alternative Feedstock. Bioamber also desires the right to further develop CB1 to utilize cellulosic biomass as the fermentation feedstock.  Cargill hereby grants Bioamber the option to modify or convert the Work Plan to include the development or modification of CB1 capable of  fermenting such cellulosic feedstock (\"Modified Work Plan\"). If such option is exercised, (a) the terms and conditions of this Development  Agreement shall apply to the Modified Work Plan except (i) new, additional up-front and milestone payments shall apply as provided  below, and (ii) any development work performed under the Modified Work Plan will be at a FTE rate which will be equivalent to the FTE rate  provided in Section 2.2 above and further adjusted for inflation at the time it goes into effect; and (b) the commercial license attached as  Exhibit D shall be expanded to include the resulting strain developed out of the Modified Work Plan with no additional change in the  financial terms. Additionally, the additional up-front fee [***].\n\nMilestone using Alternative Feedstock   Target  Date   Payment  Up-front Payment   TBD   US $[***] Milestone 1: Proof of Concept   TBD   US $[***] Milestone 2: CB1 Strain Development   TBD   US $[***] Milestone 3: CB1 Strain Optimization   TBD   US $[***]\n\n4. Confidentiality. To carry out the Work Plan, Cargill may receive from, and provide to, Bioamber certain Confidential Information, as defined  below. Such Confidential Information will be disclosed by one Party (the \"Disclosing Party\") to the other Party (the \"Receiving Party\") on  the following terms and conditions:\n\n4.1 \"Confidential Information\" means all business, technical, and financial information related to the Work Plan, the terms and discussions  relating to the Term Sheet executed by the parties on December 3, 2009 and December 4, 2009, and to any aspect of the business of each  Party that is material to the Work Plan, including, without limitation, Licensed Tool Kit, products, product compositions, raw materials,  specifications, formulae, equipment, business plans and strategies, customer lists, supplier lists, know-how, samples, drawings, pricing  informationand other financial information, inventions, ideas, research information, packaging, manufacturing processes, and other  information, or its potential use, that is owned by or in possession of either Party. For purposes of clarity, the parties shall not disclose to  each other any Confidential Information that is not material to the Work Plan, such as, by way of example and without limitation, processes  and other information relating to post-fermentation activities. Confidential Information shall not include information that: (a) is in the public  domain prior to disclosure by Disclosing Party; (b) becomes part of the public domain, by publication or otherwise, through no  unauthorized act or omission by the Receiving Party; (c) is lawfully in the Receiving Party's possession prior to disclosure by the  Disclosing Party; or (d) is independently developed by an employee(s) of the Receiving Party with no access to the disclosed Confidential  Information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Cargill Confidential   - 6 -   * Confidential treatment requested\n\n4.2 The Receiving Party agrees to take and maintain proper and appropriate steps to protect Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party.  The Receiving Party agrees to disclose the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party only to employees or agents of the Receiving  Party who are directly involved with the Work Plan contemplated by this Development Agreement, and even then only to such extent as is  necessary and essential to perform the Work Plan. The Receiving Party agrees to inform such employees and agents of the confidential  nature of the information disclosed hereunder and to cause all such employees and agents to abide by the terms of this Development  Agreement.\n\n4.3 The Receiving Party shall not disclose the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information to any unauthorized party without the Disclosing  Party's prior express written consent or unless required by court order or order of a similar governmental entity. If a Party is required by  court order or order of a similar governmental entity to disclose the other's Confidential Information, they shall give the other Party prompt  notice of such requirement so that an appropriate protective order or other relief may be sought.\n\n4.4 The Receiving Party will use Confidential Information only in connection with the Work Plan. Both Parties have reserved all rights to their  respective Confidential Information not expressly granted herein. All documents and/or tangible materials containing or comprising  Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party will remain the property of the Disclosing Party. Upon the request of the Disclosing Party,  the Receiving Party will destroy all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party and any documents prepared by the Receiving Party  using Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party and the Receiving Party agrees to provide confirmation of such destruction in  writing. The Receiving Party may, however, keep one copy of any such document in the files of its legal department or outside counsel for  record purposes only.\n\n4.5 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Development Agreement, each Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach of confidentiality  and use as provided in this Section may result in irreparable harm and damages to the Disclosing Party in an amount difficult to ascertain  and that cannot be adequately compensated by a monetary award. Accordingly, in addition to any other relief to which the Disclosing  Party may be entitled at law or in equity, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek a temporary and/or permanent injunctive relief from  any breach or threatened breach by the Receiving Party.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Cargill Confidential   - 7 -   * Confidential treatment requested\n\n4.6 The obligations imposed by this section, including but not limited to non-disclosure and non-use, however, will endure so long as the  Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party does not become part of the public domain.\n\n4.7 The existence of and the terms of this Development Agreement, including its Exhibits, are confidential and are not to be disclosed without  the prior written approval of Cargill.\n\n4.8 Neither Party may make any public announcement concerning this Development Agreement, its subject matter, and the activities and  actions it contemplates without the other Party's express written consent.  4.9 This Section 4 supercedes and replaces the Mutual Confidentiality Agreement between the Parties, which was effective July 17, 2009. All  Confidential Information that was subject to that Mutual Confidentiality Agreement is hereby made subject to the terms and conditions of  this Section 4.\n\n5. Intellectual Property  5.1 Each party shall retain ownership of all intellectual property that it owned prior to the Effective Date.\n\n5.2 Improvements. Any invention or discovery relating to the Work Plan, in whole or in part, that is conceived during the term of this  Development Agreement shall be an \"Improvement\". The scope for Improvements will be limited to the CB1 strain itself and the [***] (the  \"Field\"), but shall exclude [***]. Bioamber will own any Improvement in the field of succinic acid and salts thereof and such Improvement  shall be designated \"Bioamber Improvements\". Cargill will own any Improvement in all fields other than the field of succinic acid and salts  thereof, subject to the rights provided in Section 5.2.1 below, and such Improvement shall be designated \"Cargill Improvements\". In the  event it is not clear as to ownership of any Improvement as described in this Section 5.2, in other words, if it is not clear whether an  invention or discovery is either a Bioamber Improvement or a Cargill Improvement, such Improvement shall be [***] and such Improvement  shall be designated \"Joint Improvements\". For purposes of clarity, as examples, Cargill Improvements are those inventions relating to  fumaric acid and malic acid. Additionally, where an Improvement has applications both in the Field and outside the Field, then such  Improvement, as it applies to the Field, shall be a Bioamber Improvement and, as it applies outside the Field, such Improvement shall be a  Cargill Improvement.\n\n\n\n5.2.1 Cargill hereby grants Bioamber, and Bioamber hereby accepts, an exclusive, royalty-free license to Cargill Improvements and Joint  Improvements for use in the Field during the term of this Development Agreement with a reservation of right for Cargill to practice  such Cargill Improvements and Joint Improvements for use in the field of succinic acid and salts thereof during the term of this  Development Agreement. Such use shall be for research purposes only with no rights to sublicense and with no \"have made\"  rights. Cargill shall also grant a commercial license to Bioamber for Cargill Improvements and Joint Improvements under the terms  and conditions of Exhibit D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Cargill Confidential   - 8 -   * Confidential treatment requested\n\n  5.2.2 Bioamber hereby grants Cargill, and Cargill hereby accepts, an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license with an unlimited right to  sublicense under and to Bioamber Improvements for use outside the Field during the term of this Development Agreement. Such  use shall be for research purposes only.\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Cargill shall have the first option to prepare, file, prosecute, and maintain patent applications and issued/granted patents on  Bioamber Improvements and Joint Improvements, which option may be waived in whole or in part. Cargill shall bear all costs  incurred in connection with such preparation, filing, prosecution, and maintenance of U.S. and foreign application(s) and  issued/granted patents directed to Bioamber Improvements and Joint Improvements. Cargill shall provide Bioamber a copy of any  proposed patent application covering Bioamber Improvements and Joint Improvements in advance of the submission of the  proposed patent application to any patent office.

The Parties shall meet  regularly throughout the Term of this Development Agreement to determine whether or not licenses to Third Party Patents are needed to  perform or continue to perform the Work Plan and the next steps if such licenses are needed.\n\n13.2 Governing Law. This Development Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota,  United States of America, disregarding its conflicts of law rules.\n\n13.3 Assignment. Neither Party shall assign this Development Agreement or the obligations contained herein without the express written  consent of the other Party.\n\n13.4 Waiver. The failure of either Party to insist in any one or more instances upon performance of any terms or conditions of this Development  Agreement, is not to be construed as a waiver of future performance of any such term, covenant, or condition, but the obligations of either  Party with respect thereto will continue in full force and effect. No waiver will be effective unless in writing and signed by the waiving  Party.\n\n13.5 Amendment. No amendment, modification, or waiver of the terms of this Development Agreement shall be binding unless placed in writing  and duly executed by the Parties' authorized representatives.  13.6 Severability.

Bioamber will not itself or with or through third parties engage in the development of biocatalysts  other than E. coli for the production of succinic acid or salts thereof, except for the development activities under the terms and conditions  of this Development Agreement. This obligation endures for the Term of this Development Agreement. Notwithstanding the above,  Bioamber shall be permitted to evaluate other biocatalysts, but shall not undertake development of such biocatalysts. The purpose of such  evaluations shall be to identify and eventually secure alternative technologies, in the event that the CB1 development program is not  successful. As such, Bioamber shall cease within 30 days any further funding and development of a biocatalyst, including but not limited  to the genetic modification or the optimization of fermentation conditions, when such biocatalyst has demonstrated the ability to produce  succinic acid at a concentration above [***] grams per liter. This restriction shall apply to any succinic acid biocatalyst other than E. coli,  be it a biocatalyst developed in-house, licensed-in, or under development at a third party lab that is funded by Bioamber or to which  Bioamber has secured a future right or right of first refusal through direct payment, in kind contribution, grant, gift, differed payment or  commitment to a future payment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Parties, through their authorized representatives, hereby agree to the terms and conditions of this Development Agreement.\n\n   Cargill Confidential   - 12 -   * Confidential treatment requested\n\nCARGILL, INCORPORATED  Bio Technology Development Center     BIOAMBER S.A.S.\n\n/s/ Jack Staboch       /s/ Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Huc Signature     Signature\n\nVP BioTDC     Director General Title     Title\n\n4/16/10     April 15, 2010 Date     Date\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit A   Work Plan   Milestones\n\n[***]\n\nMILESTONE 1\n\n[***]   Time to achieve: Month 12\n\nMILESTONE 2\n\n[***]   Time to achieve: Month 30\n\nMILESTONE 3\n\n[***]   Time to achieve: Month 42      Cargill Confidential   - 13 -   * Confidential treatment requested\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit B   Cargill Patents and Patent Applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Cargill Confidential   - 14 -   * Confidential treatment requested\n\nPublication #     Title     Filing Date     Expiration Date\n\n[***]\n\nPublication #     Title     Filing Date     Expiration Date\n\n[***]\n\nPublication #     Title     Filing Date     Expiration Date\n\n[***]\n\nPublication #     Title     Filing Date     Expiration Date\n\n[***]\n\nPublication #     Title     Filing Date     Expiration Date\n\n[***]\n\nPublication #     Title     Filing Date     Expiration Date\n\n[***]\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit C   Licensed Tool Kit\n\nBasic Package   Content:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Fee Option   Content:\n\n\n\n   Cargill Confidential   - 15 -   * Confidential treatment requested\n\n  \u2022   [***]     \u2022   [***]     \u2022   [***]     \u2022   [***]     \u2022   [***]\n\n  \u2022   The price will be negotiated, but as of the Effective Date of this Agreement, the fair market value is base package price of US  $[***]\n\n  \u2022   Genome sequence of CB1, including assembly and annotations as is Cargill's state of the art at the time of the request.\n\n  \u2022   The price will be negotiated, but as of the Effective Date of this Development Agreement, the fair market value is price of US  $[***]\n\n\n\n\n\nEXHIBIT D\n\nCOMMERCIAL LICENSE AGREEMENT      Cargill Confidential   - 16 -   * Confidential treatment requested\n\n\n\n\n\nEXHIBIT E   Third Party Patents relating to the Work Plan\n\nThird Party Patents relating to Modified Work Plan\n\n   Cargill Confidential   - 17 -   * Confidential treatment requested\n\nPublication number and title   Assignee [***]\n\nPublication number and title   Assignee [***]\n\n\n\n\n\nEXHIBIT F   Cargill's Guiding Principles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCargill's Compliance Policy on Intellectual Property\n\n[*** 2 pages omitted.]      Cargill Confidential   - 18 -   * Confidential treatment requested\n\n  \u2022   Cargill will comply with the laws of all countries to which it is subject.     \u2022   Cargill will not knowingly assist any third party to violate any law of any country, by creating false documents or by any other means.     \u2022   Cargill will not pay or receive bribes or participate in any other unethical, fraudulent, or corrupt practice.     \u2022   Cargill will always honor all business obligations that it undertakes with absolute integrity.     \u2022   Cargill will keep its business records in a manner that accurately reflects the true nature of its business transactions.\n\n  \u2022   Cargill managers and supervisors will be responsible that employees, consultants and contract workers under their supervision are  familiar with applicable laws and company policies and comply with them.
