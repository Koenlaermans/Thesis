To carry the action outside of the User Defined Function to the Policy level one would have to set a variable that is then tested immediately after the User Defined Function call - for example: \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * SetGlobalVar(\"ExitNow\", 1);\n * \n * Exit();\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * SetGlobalVar(\"ExitNow\", 1);\n * \n * Exit();\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * If(GetGlobalVar(\"ExitNow\") == 1)\n * \n * {\n   Log(ID+WP+\": Existing policy...\");\n   \n * Exit\n * ();\n   }\n\n\nThe above example ties in somewhat with the exampled configuration from the TechNote \"Event Flagging with Go_NoGo checking\" [ link below] and uses structured logging as covered in the TechNote \"Structured logging in Policies\" [ link below]. \n\nIf the User Defined Function was nested within another User Defined Function one would have to exit each layer to return the Policy layer before the Exit() action would exit the Policy. \nRELATED INFORMATION\n Event Flagging with Go_NoGo checking [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21675015]\nStructured Logging in Policies [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21596180]", "content_type": "text", "id": "swg21675316"}, "is_correct_answer": true, "is_correct_document": true, "origin": "gold-label", "answer": {"answer": "This is because the Exit() parser function in IPL is designed to exit the immediate scope.

Avoiding Cluster Administration Pitfalls on 19 November 2013. \nMQ Clustering was introduced in v5.1 and customers have adopted the clustering method of messaging for ease of admin. and workload balance. Certain rules apply for config and admin, which if not followed, cause adverse effects. This session discusses ways to avoid MQ Cluster administration mistakes. \n\nCONTENT\nAsk the Experts sessions are conducted in a question and answer format.

Should any special steps be taken when joining a multi-instance QM to a cluster? 37:24 Slide 17, Workload Balancing, how to troubleshoot imbalanced workload among the cluster? 39:26 Pertaining to HIPER APAR IV25030, would you only demote or refresh the full repositories if you're seeing this corruption? 43:27 Recently my servers moved data centers, when the queue managers and repositories came up in the new data center, their IP addresses were changed. What would be the best way to recover? 46:17 We run Queue Managers on a High Availability server, meaning that they may be started on different hosts. Can you explain why the Queue Managers shold not be shut down? 52:14 Clearing out the SYSTEM.CLUSTER.TRANSMIT.QUEUE, is there an updated Support Pack? 58:37 Imbalanced workload among Queue Managers in remote clusters, would destination sequence factors affect the load balancing? 01:03:41 We are running MQ 7.0.1.10 on Solaris 10 and run into an issue that a new qmgr on another server can not join this cluster; the repository manager process keeps dying and messages in SYSTEM.CLUSTER.COMMAND.QUEUE are queing up. What could cause this issue? 01:06:43 Aside from the stranded messages, will other messages behind them also be hung pending delivery to other queue managers? 01:07:20 Is the administration error missing on slide 21? 01:07:43 Is there an updated support pack to remove stranded messages from SYSTEM.CLUSTER.TRANSMIT.QUEUE - the one referencd is for MQ V5.3? 01:08:48 what fixpack level would be EXPOSED to the problem in IV25030? 01:09:43 Slide 21: Create a new channel to a full repository queue manager. Is this done on the queue manager with the partial repository? 01:10:12 When adding Partial Repositories to a cluster, what are the considerations for which Full Repository we should aim the manual CLUSSNDR at? Is it fine to aim all Partial Repositories' manual CLUSSNDRs to one Full Repository? The partial will immediately create automatic cluster senders to both fulls anyway, so is it irrelevant which FR the partial aims its manual CLUSSNDR at? 01:11:29 I have two QM ids (with same QM) showing in full repos. Old QM id still exists even after the QM is taken out of cluster. All i need to is to reset the cluster to remove the QM id every time. How do i make the old QM ID (with the same QM) to go automatically? 01:12:35 Are there any best practices or considerations you can post with regards to DR setups? For instance, when bringing up Full Repo's in DR mode (for testing purposes). Should we rely solely on network seperation, etc.? 01:13:46 Closing remarks 01:14:51 End of Call \nPanel of Experts: Andy Emmett WebSphere MQ Distributed L3 Support Yana Johnson WebSphere MQ Distributed L2 Support Valerie Lampkin WebSphere MQ Distributed L2 Support William (Bill) Moss Websphere MQ Distributed L2 Support Miguel Rodriguez WebSphere MQ Distributed L2 Support \n\n\nPRESENTATION\n[http://www.ibm.com/i/v16/icons/weblecture.gif]WSTE-11192013-AskTheExperts-MQ_Clustering_Gotchas.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27039756&aid=2]WSTE-11192013-AskTheExperts-MQ_Clustering_Gotchas.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27039756&aid=1] \n\n\n\nGet Adobe Reader [http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html] to view PDF\n\n\nAUDIO\n[http://www.ibm.com/i/v16/icons/aud.gif]To replay the recording of this conference call, click on Download Audio [http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/websphere/techexchange/November-19-2013-Emmett-Johnson-Lampkin-Moss-Rodriguez.mp3] (audio in MP3 format).

This document covers information on setting up SSL virtualhosts, creating keyfiles, certificates along with how to protect access to directories and URLs to specific ciphers. Also, included is documentation on how to trace and record SSL traffic between a client browser and the Web server. \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe following steps help guide you through the proper set up of SSL within the IBM HTTP Server: \n\n 1. Confirm that the Global Security Kit (GSKit) is installed and meets the minimum requirements\n    \n    \n 2. Create a key database file and certificates needed to authenticate the Web server during an SSL handshake\n    \n    \n 3. Enable SSL directives within the IBM HTTP Server configuration file (httpd.conf)\n    \n    \n 4. Other considerations when enabling SSL directives within the IBM HTTP Server configuration file (httpd.conf)\n    \n    \n 5. Information that IBM WebSphere\u00ae Support needs to debug SSL configuration and certificate issues related to the IBM HTTP Server\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1. Confirm that the Global Security Kit is installed and meets the minimum requirements\n    \n    The Global Security Kit (GSKit) is a required component for the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) enablement within the IBM HTTP Server. Therefore, it is important to confirm that a supported version of the Global Security Kit is installed prior to enabling SSL.\n    \n    For a complete listing of IBM HTTP Server releases and corresponding Global Security Kit versions, click IBM HTTP Server: Global Security Kit (GSKit) supported versions [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=177&context=SSEQTJ&uid=swg21173214].\n    \n    \n    \n 2. Create a key database file and certificates needed to authenticate the Web server during an SSL handshake\n    \n    The iKeyman GUI, which is included within the IBM HTTP Server distribution, can be used to create a key database file (for example: key.kdb) needed to store personal server certificates required by the client browser during an SSL handshake.\n    \n    For quick information on how to create a key database file and personal server certificates, refer to the technote IKEYMAN, How do I...? [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=177&context=SSEQTJ&uid=swg21006430] \n    \n    More extensive information on using the iKeyman GUI to create key database files and certificates is located here:  * For releases of IBM HTTP Server v7.0 [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.ihs.doc%2Finfo%2Fihs%2Fihs%2Fwelc_ikeymangui.html] \n     * For releases of IBM HTTP Server v8.0 [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.ihs.doc%2Finfo%2Fihs%2Fihs%2Fwelc_ikeymangui.html] \n     * For releases of IBM HTTP Server v8.5 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSD28V_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.ihs.doc/ihs/welc_ikeymangui.html] \n     * For releases of IBM HTTP Server v9.0 [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.ihs.doc/ihs/welc_ikeymangui.html] \n       \n       \n    \n    \n 3.

Create an SSL virtualhost stanza using the following examples and directives\n        \n        If you are enabling one Web site for SSL, and the hostname is the same as the one already defined in the Global Scope for non-SSL (port 80), you can enable SSL as follows. This virtualhost uses the default hostname defined by the ServerName directive in the Global Scope and the IP address associated with it.\n        \n        http://www.mycompany.com (non-SSL) 192.168.1.102 https://www.mycompany.com (SSL) 192.168.1.102\n        \n        Example 1:\n        \n        Listen 80\n        ServerName www.mycompany.com\n        \n        <Directory \"c:/Program Files/IBM HTTP Server/htdocs\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        </Directory>\n        \n        DocumentRoot \"c:/program files/ibm http server/htdocs\"\n        DirectoryIndex index.html\n        \n        Listen 443\n        <VirtualHost :443>\n        SSLEnable\n        SSLClientAuth None\n        </VirtualHost>\n        \n        SSLDisable\n        KeyFile \"c:/program files/ibm http server/key.kdb\"\n        SSLV2Timeout 100\n        SSLV3Timeout 1000 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21179559&amp;aid=3]\n        \n        If you are enabling one Web site for SSL and the ServerName is different than the ServerName already defined in the Global Scope for non-SSL (port 80), you can enable SSL as follows. Both hostnames must be registered in DNS to a separate IP address, and both IP addresses must be configured on local network interface cards.\n        \n        http://www.mycompany.com (non-SSL) 192.168.1.102 http://www.mycompany2.com (non-SSL) 192.168.1.103 https://www.mycompany2.com (SSL) 192.168.1.103\n        \n        Example 2:\n        \n        Listen 80\n        ServerName www.mycompany.com\n        \n        <Directory \"c:/Program Files/IBM HTTP Server/htdocs\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        </Directory>\n        \n        DocumentRoot \"c:/program files/ibm http server/htdocs\"\n        DirectoryIndex index.html\n        \n        <VirtualHost 192.168.1.103:80>\n        ServerName www.mycompany2.com\n        <Directory \"c:/Program Files/IBM HTTP Server/htdocs2\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        </Directory>\n        DocumentRoot \"c:/program files/ibm http server/htdocs2\"\n        DirectoryIndex index2.html\n        </VirtualHost>\n        \n        Listen 443\n        <VirtualHost 192.168.1.103:443>\n        ServerName www.mycompany2.com\n        SSLEnable\n        SSLClientAuth None\n        <Directory \"c:/Program Files/IBM HTTP Server/htdocs2\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        </Directory>\n        DocumentRoot \"c:/program files/ibm http server/htdocs2\"\n        DirectoryIndex index2.html\n        </VirtualHost>\n        \n        SSLDisable\n        KeyFile \"c:/program files/ibm http server/key.kdb\"\n        SSLV2Timeout 100\n        SSLV3Timeout 1000 \n        If you are enabling multiple Web sites for SSL, you can enable SSL as follows. All hostnames must be registered in DNS to a separate IP address. Also, all the IP addresses must be configured on a local network interface card. You must use the SSLServerCert directive to identify which personal server certificate in the key database file is passed to the client browser during the SSL handshake for each Web site. If the SSLServerCert directive is not defined, the IBM HTTP Server passes whatever certificate in the key database file is marked(*) as the \"default key\".\n        \n        For more information on why different IP addresses are required when enabling multiple Web sites for SSL: IP-Based Virtual Hosting must be used if configuring multiple SSL Virtual Host [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=177&context=SSEQTJ&uid=swg21045922]http://www.mycompany.com (non-SSL) 192.168.1.102 https://www.mycompany.com (non-SSL) 192.168.1.102 http://www.mycompany2.com (non-SSL) 192.168.1.103 https://www.mycompany2.com (SSL) 192.168.1.103 http://www.mycompany3.com (non-SSL) 192.168.1.104 https://www.mycompany3.com (SSL) 192.168.1.104\n        \n        Example 3:\n        \n        Listen 80\n        ServerName www.mycompany.com\n        \n        <Directory \"c:/Program Files/IBM HTTP Server/htdocs\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        </Directory>\n        \n        DocumentRoot \"c:/program files/ibm http server/htdocs\"\n        DirectoryIndex index.html\n        \n        <VirtualHost 192.168.1.103:80>\n        ServerName www.mycompany2.com\n        <Directory \"c:/Program Files/IBM HTTP Server/htdocs2\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        </Directory>\n        DocumentRoot \"c:/program files/ibm http server/htdocs2\"\n        DirectoryIndex index2.html\n        </VirtualHost>\n        \n        <VirtualHost 192.168.1.104:80>\n        ServerName www.mycompany3.com\n        <Directory \"c:/Program Files/IBM HTTP Server/htdocs3\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        </Directory>\n        DocumentRoot \"c:/program files/ibm http server/htdocs3\"\n        DirectoryIndex index3.html\n        </VirtualHost>\n        \n        Listen 443\n        <VirtualHost 192.168.1.102:443>\n        ServerName www.mycompany.com\n        SSLEnable\n        SSLClientAuth None\n        SSLServerCert mycompany\n        <Directory \"c:/Program Files/IBM HTTP Server/htdocs\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        </Directory>\n        DocumentRoot \"c:/program files/ibm http server/htdocs\"\n        DirectoryIndex index.html\n        </VirtualHost>\n        \n        <VirtualHost 192.168.1.103:443>\n        ServerName www.mycompany2.com\n        SSLEnable\n        SSLClientAuth None\n        SSLServerCert mycompany2\n        <Directory \"c:/Program Files/IBM HTTP Server/htdocs2\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        </Directory>\n        DocumentRoot \"c:/program files/ibm http server/htdocs2\"\n        DirectoryIndex index2.html\n        </VirtualHost>\n        \n        <VirtualHost 192.168.1.104:443>\n        ServerName www.mycompany3.com\n        SSLEnable\n        SSLClientAuth None\n        SSLServerCert mycompany3\n        <Directory \"c:/Program Files/IBM HTTP Server/htdocs3\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        </Directory>\n        DocumentRoot \"c:/program files/ibm http server/htdocs3\"\n        DirectoryIndex index3.html\n        </VirtualHost>\n        \n        SSLDisable\n        KeyFile \"c:/program files/ibm http server/key.kdb\"\n        SSLV2Timeout 100\n        SSLV3Timeout 1000 \n        \n        \n    \n    \n 4.

Quick steps to work around the MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED errors during development are provided in the 'Resolving the problem' section, as well as considerations for implementing security in production environments. A summary is also provided of behavior for outbound scenarios with container-managed and component-managed security, as well as inbound behavior for listener ports and activiation specifications \n\nSYMPTOM\nJMSCMQ0001: WebSphere MQ call failed with compcode '2' ('MQCC_FAILED') reason '2035' ('MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED')\n\n\nCAUSE\nThe two most likely reasons why the connection is refused by MQ are as follows: \n\n 1. The user identifier passed across the client connection from the application server to MQ is not known on the server where the MQ queue manager is running, is not authorised to connect to MQ, or is longer than 12 characters and has been truncated.\n    We discuss how this user identifier is obtained and passed over the connection in more detail below.\n    For queue managers running on Windows, the following error might be seen in the MQ error logs for this scenario:\n    AMQ8075: Authorization failed because the SID for entity 'wasuser' cannot be obtained.\n    For UNIX no entry in the MQ error logs would be seen by default.\n    See technote MQS_REPORT_NOAUTH environment variable can be used to better diagnose return code 2035 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg21299319] for details of enabling error log entries on all platforms. \n 2. The user identifier passed across the client connection from the application server to MQ is a member of the 'mqm' group on the server hosting the MQ queue manager, and a Channel Authentication Record (CHLAUTH) exists that blocks administrative access to the queue manager. WebSphere MQ configures a CHLAUTH record by default in WebSphere MQ Version 7.1 and later that blocks all MQ admins from connecting as a client to the queue manager.\n    The following error in the MQ error logs would be seen for this scenario:\n    AMQ9777: Channel was blocked\n\nSee the Error logs on Windows, UNIX and Linux systems [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r5/topic/com.ibm.mq.tro.doc/q039560_.htm] section of the MQ Information Center for the location of the MQ error logs. \nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nTo understand the cause of the MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED reason code, you need to understand what username (and password) is being used by MQ to authorise the application server. \n\nPlease note that WebSphere MQ V7.5 and earlier does not provide any out-of-the box password authentication system for client connections.\nPassword authentication is provided out of the box in IBM MQ V8.0. More details on the new IBM MQ V8.0 security features are available in this presentation [https://www.slideshare.net/MoragHughson/websphere-mq-v8-security-deep-dive]. \n\nFor WebSphere MQ V7.5 and earlier, this means that while the understanding provided in this technote over how usernames/passwords are passed from the application server to MQ is helpful for development environments, solving the security requirements of production environments usually also requires one of the following approaches: \n\n * Mutual SSL/TLS authentication.\n   MQ provides out-of-the-box features to authenticate a remotely attaching client using the digital certificate they provide for SSL/TLS transport security. For example by configuring an SSLPEER rule on the SVRCONN channel to match the Distinguished Name in the certificate of the WebSphere Application Server, and establishing trust in the issuer of that certificate. \n * A custom, or 3rd party supplied, WebSphere MQ Security Exit\n   A security exit can be written for MQ that performs username and password authentication against a repository, such as the local operating system on the MQ server, or an LDAP repository.\n   When using a security exit for authentication it is important that SSL/TLS transport security is still configured, to ensure passwords are not sent in plain text.\n\n\nMCA user ID (MCAUSER) configured on the Server Connection (SVRCONN) channel If an MCAUSER is configured on the SVRCONN channel that the application server is using to connect, and no security exit or mapping Channel Authentication Record is installed, then this overrides the username provided by the application server. \n\nIt is common practice for many customers to set an MCAUSER on every SVRCONN channel, and use mutual SSL/TLS authentication exclusively for authentication. \n\nDefault behaviour when no credentials are supplied in the application server \n\nIf no credentials are supplied by the application on the createConnection call, and neither of the component managed or container managed security systems described below are configured, then WebSphere Application Server provides a blank username to MQ. This causes MQ to authorise the client based on the userid that the MQ listener is running under. In the majority of cases this is 'mqm' on UNIX/Linux systems and 'MUSR_MQADMIN' on Windows. \n\nAs these are administrative MQ users, they will be blocked by default in WebSphere MQ V7.1 and higher, with a AMQ9777 error logged in the error logs of the queue manager. \n\nContainer-managed security for outbound connections \n\nThe recommended way to configure the username and password passed to MQ by the application server for outbound connections, is to use container-managed security. Outbound connections are those created using a Connection Factory, rather than a Listener Port or Activation Specification. \n\nUsernames of 12 characters or less are passed to MQ by the appliaction server. Usernames longer than 12 characters in length will be truncated, either during authorisation (on UNIX), or in the MQMD of messages that are sent. \n\nContainer-managed security means that the deployment descriptor, or EJB 3.0 annotations, of the application declare a resource reference with authentication type set to Container. \n\nThen when the application looks up the Connection Factory in JNDI, it does so indirectly via the resource reference. For example an EJB 2.1 application would perform a JNDI lookup as follows, where \"jms/MyResourceRef\" has been declared as a resource reference in the deployment descriptor: \n\nConnectionFactory myCF = (ConnectionFactory)ctx.lookup(\"java:comp/env/jms/MyResourceRef\") \n\nAn EJB 3.0 application might declare an annotated object property on the bean as follows:\n@Resource(name = \"jms/MyResourceRef\", \nauthenticationType = AuthenticationType.CONTAINER)\nprivate javax.jms.ConnectionFactory myCF; \n\nWhen the application is deployed by an administrator, they bind this authentication alias to an actual Connection Factory that has been created in JNDI, and assign it a J2C authentication alias on deployment. \n\nIt is the username and password contained in this authentication alias that is then passed to MQ/JMS by the application server when the application connects. This approach puts the administrator in control of which username and password is used by each application, and prevents a different application from looking up the connection factory in JNDI directly to connect with the same username and password. \n\nA default container-managed authentication alias can be supplied on the configuration panels in the administrative console for MQ connection factories. This default will only be used in the case that an application uses a resource reference configured for container-managed security, but the administrator has not bound it to an authentication alias during deployment. A screen shot is provided below:\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21636093&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21636093&aid=1] \n\nDefault component-managed authentication alias for outbound connections \n\nFor cases where it is impractical to change the application to use container-managed security, or to change it to supply a username and password directly on the createConnection call, it is possible to supply a default. \n\nThis default is called the \"component-managed authentication alias\" and cannot be configured via the administrative console (since WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0 when it was removed from the panels MQ connection factories). The below scripting samples show how to configure it using wsadmin: \n\n * JACL:\n   wsadmin>set cell [ $AdminConfig getid \"/Cell:mycell\" ]\n   \n   mycell(cells/mycell|cell.xml#Cell_1)\n   \n   wsadmin>$AdminTask listWMQConnectionFactories $cell\n   \n   MyCF(cells/mycell|resources.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104)\n   \n   wsadmin>$AdminTask modifyWMQConnectionFactory MyCF(cells/mycell|resources.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104) { -componentAuthAlias myalias }\n   \n   MyCF(cells/mycell|resources.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104) \n * Jython:\n   wsadmin>cell = AdminConfig.getid(\"/Cell:mycell\")\n   \n   wsadmin>AdminTask.listWMQConnectionFactories(cell)\n   \n   'MyCF(cells/mycell|resources.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104)'\n   \n   wsadmin>AdminTask.modifyWMQConnectionFactory('MyCF(cells/mycell|resos urces.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104)', \"-componentAuthAlias myalias\")\n   \n   'MyCF(cells/mycell|resources.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104)'\n\n\nAuthentication alias for inbound MDB connections using an activation specification For inbound connections using an activation specification an authentication alias can be specified by the administrator when deploying the application, or a default authentication alias can be specified on the activation specification via the administrative console. \n\nAuthentication alias for inbound MDB connections using a listener port \n\nFor inbound connections using a listener port, the value specified in the \"Container-managed authentication alias\" setting of the connection factory (seen in the above screenshot) is used. \n\nOn zOS, first the \"Container-managed authentication alias\" is checked and used if set, then the \"Component-managed authentication alias\" is checked and used it set.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe simplest steps to resolve the 2035 MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED errors in a development environment, where full transport security is not required, are as follows: \n\n 1. Choose a user that you want WebSphere Application Server to be authenticated as. Typically the user chosen should have authority relevant to the context of the operations required by the application running in WebSphere Application Server and no more. For example, 'mqm' or other super user is not appropriate. \n 2. If this user is an MQ administrative user, then relax the Channel Authentication Record (CHLAUTH) security in MQ V7.1 or higher, so that administrative connections are not blocked on the SVRCONN channel you wish to use. An example MQSC command to do this for a SVRCONN channel called 'WAS.CLIENTS' is provided as follows:\n    SET CHLAUTH('WAS.CLIENTS') TYPE(BLOCKUSER) USERLIST(ALLOWANY) \n 3. Configure the SVRCONN channel to set the MCA user ID (MCAUSER) to the user you have chosen. An example MQSC command to configure a SVRCONN channel to use 'myuser' as the MCA user ID is provided as follows:\n    ALTER CHL('WAS.CLIENTS') CHLTYPE(SVRCONN) MCAUSER('myuser')\n\n\nThe following additional considerations are important for production environments: For all production environments where transport security is required, SSL/TLS security must be configured between the application server and MQ. \n\nIn order to configure SSL/TLS transport security, you must establish the appropriate trust between the MQ queue manager and WebSphere Application Server. The application server, who initiates the SSL/TLS handshake, must always be configured to trust the certificate provided by the MQ queue manager . If the application server is configured to send a certificate to the MQ queue manager, then the queue manager must also be configured to trust it. \n\nIf trust is not correctly configured on both sides, you will encounter 2393 MQRC_SSL_INITIALIZATION_ERROR reason codes after enabling SSL/TLS on the connection. \n\nIf you do not have a security exit that performs username and password authentication, then you should configure mutual SSL/TLS authentication on your Server Connection channel to cause the queue manager to require a trusted certificate is provided by the application server. To do this you set \"SSL Authentication\" to \"Required\" in the MQ Explorer or SSLCAUTH(REQUIRED) via MQSC. \n\nIf you do have a security exit that performs username and password authentication installed in your MQ server, then configure your application to supply a username and password for validation by that security exit. The details of how to configure the username and password passed to MQ by the application server are described above in the \"Diagnosing the problem\" section. \n\nAll Server Connection channels that do not have SSL/TLS security applied should be disabled. Example MQSC commands to disable the SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN channel are provided as follows (these assume no user exists on the MQ server called 'NOAUTH'):\nALTER CHL(SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN) CHLTYPE(SVRCONN) MCAUSER('NOAUTH')\nSTOP CHL(SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN) \n\nDetails of how to configure the private certificate and trust of a MQ queue manager, and to enable SSL security on a Server Connection channel, see the following locations in the MQ information center: \n\n * To configure the certificates and trust of the MQ queue manager see the following topic:\n   Configuring SSL on queue managers [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.mq.explorer.doc%2Fe_ssl_channels.htm] \n * To configure the Server Connection channel, used by applications running in the application server to connect to MQ, see the following topic:\n   Configuring SSL channels [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.mq.explorer.doc/e_ssl_channels.htm]\n\n\nDetails of how you configure trust within WebSphere Application Server, and whether the application server sends a certificate to MQ for authentication, are in the following locations in the WebSphere Application Server information center:  * To create or modify an SSL Configuration containing the appropriate SSL/TLS configuration for connecting to MQ, see the following topic:\n   SSL configurations [http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/wsbroker/redirect?version=phil&product=was-base-dist&topic=csec_sslconfigs]\n   Note that MQ requires you specify a matching Cipher Suite / Cipher Spec on both sides of the connection, as it checks the negotiated Cipher Suite matches the SSLCIPH setting on the channel after the handshake is complete.

Rational Application Developer v8.0.3+ is available as a 64-bit application install on specified 64-bit operating systems, in addition to a 32-bit application install.\nThere is only one installation package. When installing RAD/RSA using IBM Installation Manager, on the Location page , if your operating system is 64-bit, then select 64-bit or 32-bit to install the product in the corresponding bit mode. \n\n \n\nThese products will be referred to generically as Rational Software Development Platform (RSDP) based products. For example, WebSphere Integration Developer v6.x/7.x is RSDP based. \n\nExamples of some 64 bit Operating Systems: \n\n * Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition (running on an AMD or Intel processor) \n * Microsoft Windows 7 Professional 64-bit \n * Red Hat Linux Enterprise Server 4+ running on x86-64 bit \n * RAD 9.0 under 9.0.1 introduced support for Mac OS x - Lion 10.7 32 bit (with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 40) and Mountain Lion 10.8 - 32 bit. Likewise for RSA for WebSphere 9.0.0.1.\n   RAD 9.0.1.1 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS x Mavericks 10.9 ( with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 71)\n   RSA 9.1.2 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10 and OS X El Capitan 10.11 (with Oracle JDK 7.0 Update 75 for OS X)\n\n\n\nNote: RSDP 32-bit JVM based products, do not require any additional or special set-up on a supported 64-bit operating system (O/S). \nThey run on the provided/supported 32-bit JVM for that RSDP product, as is. \n\nReview the following documents for more details on the system requirements: \n * (7014264) Rational Application Developer System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014264] \n * (7014274) Rational Software Architect Family System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014274] \n * (7014269) Rational Software Modeler System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014269]\n   \n\n\nThe above items such as the Rational Application Developer System Requirements List cover latest versions and operating systems such as Windows Vista and Windows 7. Support is limited to 32 bit mode on 64 bit operating systems on all versions prior to Rational Application Developer 8.0.3. For more information consult: \nKnown problems and limitations to installing 64-bit Rational Application Developer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21499482] \nas referred to by the above Rational Application Developer System Requirements List. The following technote: \n- Benefits, requirements, limitations, and known issues for Rational Software Architect products running as 64-bit applications starting from v8.0.3 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27021665] \n, especially Benefits, describes what is possible with a larger heap size with the 64-bit JVM. \n\nIn deciding if you want a 64-bit install of RAD/RSA, it is useful to know that the ClearCase SCM Adapter and the Rational RequisitePro integration features/plugins are not supported or provided. These are only available as 32-bit eclipse plugins. \n\nIf you have any further questions, contact IBM Support for Rational Application Developer, or the appropriate IBM RSDP product support team. \n\n\nWebSphere Servers that are shipped with RSDP products: \n\nThe various WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} prior to v8.0.4 are only provided as 32 bit editions. As of Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.4+, 64 bit editions of WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers are shipped in addition to the 32 bit editions. \n\nThe WebSphere Application Server v8.x (not beta) server shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.3+ is provided as one edition, and there is an installation option to install either the 32 bit or 64 bit JVM/JRE (IBM Software Development Kit (SDK)). Any 64 bit edition or 64-bit JVM requires a supported 64 bit operating system. This IBM Education Assistant Module/PDF : IBM WebSphere Application Server V8 Distributed platform installation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/ieduasst/v1r1m0/topic/com.ibm.iea.was_v8/was/8.0/Installation/WASV8_dist_install.pdf] , demonstrates selecting a 32-bit or 64-bit SDK as part of a WAS v8.0 install using IBM Installation manager. If the WAS v8.0 installation is on a 32-bit operating system, this feature choice between IBM 32-bit SDK Java 6.0 or IBM 64-bit SDK Java 6.0 is not available and the installation will automatically default to the IBM 32-bit SDK Java 6.0. \n\nThe shipped WebSphere Portal Server v6.x/7.x servers are 32 bit or 64 bit editions. depending on whether you chose the IBM WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment, 32-bit or 64-bit server to install on. \n\nNote: It is possible to work with any 64 bit remotely accessible or local stand-alone WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x/8.x. In Rational Application Developer 8.0.3+ be aware of the Info Center topic: Creating profiles for WebSphere Application Server on a 64-bit machine [Creating%20profiles%20for%20WebSphere%20Application%20Server%20on%20a%2064-bit%20machine] and see this APAR opened against RAD 8.5.1/8.5.5 : PI06339: A 64-bit install of the WebSphere Application Server Profile Management Tool may not launch on Windows 7.

The following will outline how to identify if a process ulimit is the culprit and what WebSphere Application Server Support recommends to fix the case. \n\nSYMPTOM\nAn out of memory Dump Event such as: \n\n\"systhrow\" (00040000) Detail \"java/lang/OutOfMemoryError\"\n\"Failed to create a thread: retVal -1073741830, errno 11\" received\n\nNote: This detailed message will appear only in javacores.\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nWhen using WebSphere Application Server, ulimits can be set to fix or tune around a number of problems. For more on how to set a ulimit refer to the \"Guidelines for setting ulimits [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21469413]\" Technote which goes into detail on setting different ulimits on various operating systems and the difference between the soft and hard limit. This article is concerned particularly with the \"-u\" ulimit or \"nproc\" limit on Linux, the ulimit - r on AIX which affects the number of threads allowed for a single user process running WebSphere Application Server. \n\nThe AIX issue is less commonly seen as it limits then number of threads for a process but is seen in application servers with very large thread pools, This is becoming more common in 64bit addressing JVMs running complex applications. WebSphere Application support recommends setting the ulimit -r ulimited on AIX.\n\nThe nproc limit usually only counts processes on a server towards determining this number. Linux systems running WebSphere Application Server are a particular case. The nproc limit on Linux counts the number of threads within all processes that can exist for a given user. To determine the ulimit settings of a WebSphere Application Server process running on Linux refer to \"How to determine the ulimit settings of a running WebSphere Application Server process on Linux [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21407889]\".\n\nUser Limits (in bytes except for NOFILE and NPROC) \n\ntype soft limit hard limit RLIMIT_AS unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_CORE unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_CPU unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_DATA unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_FSIZE unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_LOCKS unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_MEMLOCK 65536 65536 RLIMIT_NOFILE 65536 65536 RLIMIT_NPROC 131072 131072 \n\nFor most cases of older versions of Linux this value will be defaulted to around 2048. For out of the box Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 the default value for nproc will be set to 1024. This low default setting for larger systems will not allow for enough threads in all processes. \n\nWebSphere Application Server Support recommends setting the ulimit -u or nproc to a value of 131072 when running on Linux to safely account for all the forked threads within processes that could be created. \n\nBy using this recommended value a sufficient number of threads in all processes will be allowed and will not be a limiting factor for the environment. Increasing the limit to the suggested value should have no negative impact. When the number of threads in all processes reaches the -u ulimit, an out of memory error message will be thrown. This issue can be avoided by increasing this limit. Be aware that if the number of threads/processes reaches the recommended number of 131072 or close, the issue may be deeper and continuing to increase the -u ulimit will only prove to be a temporary fix. \n\nOnce the ulimit is increased, the WebSphere Application Server will need to be restarted to use the \nnew setting. In the case of WebSphere Application Server ND, the nodeagent and the servers on the nodes will need to be restarted.", "content_type": "text", "id": "swg21648497"}, "is_correct_answer": true, "is_correct_document": true, "origin": "gold-label", "answer": {"answer": "WebSphere Application Server Support recommends setting the ulimit -u or nproc to a value of 131072 when running on Linux to safely account for all the forked threads within processes that could be created."}, "no_answer": false}, {"query": "Can I apply a TIP 2.2 fix pack directly to a TIP 2.1 installation?

The preferred method would be remote install, but I'm not even able to perform tamcd addbundles as it complains about missing prerequisites.\n\nIf I try to install the agent locally on the Linux machine, the list of available agents does not include NMA agent at all.\n\nIs there a solution to this problem?", "document": {"content": "ITM Virtual environments install NMA N4 unable find bundle prerequisites CI addbundles TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n The installation of NMA agent from package ITM for Virtual Environment V7.2.0.3 is failing with both remote or local installation on Linux x86-64. \n\nSYMPTOM\n1) The import of the whole bundle using command: \n\n/opt/IBM/ITM/bin/tacmd addbundles -i <inst_media>/ITMfVE_Agents/unix\n\nwill fail with message:\n\nUnable to find bundle prerequisite: ci 06.22.04.000 li6263\n\n--\n\n2) Even if you succeed in importing the bundle, the remote deploy of N4 agent on a Linux X86_64 fails because the installer recognizes the target node as a 64bit while the agent comes with a different architecture (li6263).\n\n--\n\n3) If you try to install the ITM for VE agents locally on a Linux x86_64, the usual installation procedure does not work for the same reason of point 2.\nThe installer recognizes the target node as a 64bit platform and the agents are 32bit and so it does not show the expected list of agents.\n\n\nCAUSE\nThe causes for the three scenarios depends on wrong prerequisite levels packaged into ITM for VE 7.2.0.3 for NMA agent, and on unexpected architecture recognized by the installer when trying to install the agent on the target node, if this one is a Linux x86-64.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe issues should be corrected at Installer level, APAR IV84919 has been opened to fix them. \n\nAnyway, since the correction involves the installation component, it will not be available until next release, when the Installation package will be built again. \n\nUntil then, you can bypass the issue with some manual steps. \n\n--------------- \n\n1) If the import of agent bundle using command tacmd addbundles fails with message: \n\nUnable to find bundle prerequisite: ci 06.22.04.000 li6263\n\nthis occurs because some agents, particularly N4 agent, have old prerequisites for shared components (ax, ui, gs,jr) that are not part of the ITM_for_VE bundle. \n\nThere is actually a workaround to correctly import the bundle in the depot, but it will not be of any help because remote installation of N4 agent will then fail due to the problem described in item number 2. \n\nIt can be anyway useful to know the workaround as it can be applied to other agents for which remote installation instead correctly works.\n\nYou must verify if the prerequisites mentioned in the error message are already present in your depot by using command tacmd viewdepot.\nBeside of the one mentioned in the error message, you must be sure that also the other wanted prerequisites are already present in the depot.\n\nN4 agent has the following prerequisites:\n\nProduct Code : n4 \nDeployable : True \nVersion : 062200000 \nDescription : Monitoring Agent for Network Devices \nHost Type : li6263 \nHost Version : li6263,lx8266 \nPrerequisites: ci:062204000 la:ipaddr05400 gs:074027000 jr:051201000 \nui:062204000 ax:062204000\n\nIf all of them are already in the depot, then you can run the tamcd addbundles using flag \"-n\" (ignore prerequisites), this will allow to correctly import the agent bundle.\n\nIf you do not have the wanted prerequisite levels, you have two possible options:\n\na) retrieve and add them into depot from other ITM installation packages\nb) modify the agent dsc files and change the level of the components required by the agent to match the level delivered with the bundle.\n\nFor example, ITM for Virtual Environment 7.2.0.3 delivers CI component at level 06.30.05.000, so if we consider N4 agent, you may need to change the file n4li6263.dsc in the rows:\n\n<PrereqProdCode>ci</PrereqProdCode>\n\n<PrereqVersion>\n\n<Version>06</Version>\n\n<Release>22</Release>\n\n<Mod>04</Mod>\n\n<Level>000</Level>\n\n\nto \n\n\n<PrereqProdCode>ci</PrereqProdCode>\n\n<PrereqVersion>\n\n<Version>06</Version>\n\n<Release>30</Release>\n\n<Mod>05</Mod>\n\n<Level>000</Level> \n\n \n\nThe same for other components in case they are also missing from your depot. \n\nThe dsc files are into <installation_media>/ITMfVE_Agents/unix folder. \n\nRepeat the tacmd addbundles command and it should now work fine. \n\nAs previously said, please consider that this scenario may occur also for agents different than N4, and the workaround is applicable also for them. \n\nOf course the target dsc file name changes accordingly to the agent type and related architecture. \n\n \n\n2) The above workaround can help in case the issue is only related to backleveled prerequisite packages. \n\nAnyway, once you applied it, if the target node for the N4 agent is a Linux x86-64, you will anyway not be able to install it remotely.\nThe remote deploy of N4 agent on a Linux X86_64 fails because the installer recognizes the target node as a 64bit while the agent comes with a different architecture (li6263). \nThe quickest workaround in this case is to install the agent locally.\n\n3) If you try to install the ITM for VE agents locally on a Linux x86_64, the usual installation procedure does not work for the same reason of point 2. \nThe installer recognizes the target node as a 64bit platform and the agents are 32bit. \nSo the installer menu will show no available agents to be installed.\n\nYou need to proceed as follow:\n\na) Run the local installation of N4 agent on target machine and proceed as usual when you are prompted with Installer initial questions.\nb) Select Other operating systems when you are showed this panel\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21983839&aid=1]

Unix Error Code 24. \n * Truncated Core Dumps / Heap Dumps\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n \n\nIs it possible to display the current ulimit settings? The command ulimit -Xa will display all current settings that are set for the current login session, where X represents the hard (H) or soft (S) limits to be displayed. By default, if no value is supplied for X, soft limits will be displayed. However if a process is already running, it may have a different ulimit configurations than the current shell that you run the ulimit -a command in.\n\n\n\n\nHow are ulimts set? Soft vs. Hard limits Soft limits are the current setting for a particular limit. They can be increased only to the current hard limit setting. \n\nHard limits are the maximum limit that can be configured. Any changes to these require root access. \n\n \n\nTemporary Settings (for current session) \n\n * \n * ulimit -[H|S]limit_name limit_value\n\n\nTemporary settings are set via the command line using the ulimit command. The limit_name must be present in the command (see the chart below). These settings are only temporary for the current session and will be lost once the session is over or the terminal window is closed. \n\nThis syntax can be used within shell scripts. Any processes spawned from these shell scripts will also have the temporary settings for the lifetime they are running. \n\nBy default, the soft limit will be changed (as changing the hard limit needs root access). Use -H (for hard limits) or -S (for soft limits) to change specific hard or soft limits. \n\nNOTES: \n\nOn HP-UX, if you receive an error when setting a particular limit, and you have altered that particular hard limit, you may need to check and see if it had exceeded the kernel parameters. You can use kctune to check (and alter) these if necessary; check your HP-UX documentation for more information. \n\nFor Solaris, settings in the \"/etc/system\" configuration file also allow configuring of some kernel-wide limits. \n\n \n\nGlobal Settings \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21469413&amp;aid=1] Any changes to these global configuration limits files should be performed by your system administrator. Instructions on how to edit the files can be found on the manpage or in the commented section of the configuration file, as they can vary between versions of UNIX or Linux. \n\n \n\nThe format of the file, which differs slightly on versions of AIX and Linux, allows individual limits per users or groups, as well as set hard and soft limits. The limits defined in this configuration file are set globally. \n\n \n\nChanges made to any limits file take effect after launching a new login shell (such as bash -l), or if the user logs out and logs back in to the system. \n\n \n\nNOTES: \n\nOn Solaris and HP-UX, changes made to your shell's profile configuration (.profile or .login) should also take effect on the next login shell launched, or when your user logs back in using the specific shell. \n\nFor kernel-wide settings, which usually require a restart of the operating system to take effect, HP-UX has the kctune command, while Solaris has the /etc/system configuration file. \n\n \n\nSpecifics for each Operating System:\nThe most up-to-date information on the limits can be found in the man page for \"ulimit\".\n\n\n\nAIX \nGlobal settings are generally set in the file /etc/security/limits, although there may be different limit files for LPARs and WPARs. \n\n \n\nPlease note that this table may not represent all ulimit items as they can vary between operating system versions.

Instead, you would need to issue the specific ulimit command in your shell's (or user's) profile configuration (like .profile or .login). \n\nAlso depending on the shell used, the ulimit command is slightly different. See the man page for further information. \n\nYou can also set kernel wide settings for many of these ulimits in the /etc/system file. \nFor example, \"set lim_fd_max = [value]\" and \"set rlim_fd_cur = [value]\" are respectively the global hard and soft file descriptor limits. See the system OS's documentation for information on the /etc/system file. \nPlease note that this table may not represent all ulimit items as they can vary between operating system versions. Consult the ulimit man page or your OS documentation for further information.\n\n\n\nCommand Line limit_name * \n(sh, ksh, bash) Command Line \n(csh) Description ulimit -c [value] ulimit coredumpsize [value]\n(K bytes) Core file size in 512 byte blocks. ulimit -d [value]\n(K bytes) ulimit datasize [value]\n(K bytes) Data segment size of processes in kilobytes. ulimit -f [value] ulimit filesize [value]\n(K bytes) File size limit in 512 byes blocks. ulimit -n [value] ulimit descriptors [value] Max number of open files and/or sockets per process (plus 1) ulimit -s [value]\n(K bytes) ulimit stacksize [value]\n(K bytes) The stack segment size in kilobytes. ulimit -t [value]\n(seconds) ulimit cputime [value]\n(seconds) Max per process CPU time (in seconds). ulimit -v [value]\n(K bytes) ulimit memorysize [value]\n(K bytes) Maximum size of virtual memory (in kilobytes) * Values are in 512 byte blocks unless otherwise specified, check your man page for further information. \n\n\n\n\nIf I am experiencing Too Many Open Files (Unix Error Code 24), can I increase the number of file descriptors? \nYes you can through the ulimit -n [value] command. However these settings won't take effect until you restart your application server (and nodeagent), making sure you restart on the same command line where you executed \"ulimit -n\". \n\nHowever, if you increase the value high enough and still run into these errors, you may want to check for a file descriptor leak (meaning a leak of opened files and/or sockets in your application code). The command lsof, offered on a variety of operating systems, can provide information on the quantity and types of file descriptors in use. \n\nFurther information can be found at this link: Too Many Open Files error message [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352] \n\n\nOn Linux, can I set the ulimit for the number of open files to unlimited? Certain versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux do not allow this value to be set to unlimited due to a known issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=507159]. The limit must be set to an integer value no larger than 1048576. Other versions of Linux may not have this restriction. In the Information Center for WebSphere Application Server, there is a recommendation [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_8.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tprf_tunelinux.html] of 8000. \n\nIf an attempt is made to set this ulimit to unlimited via the command line, an error will be displayed, and the old value will remain in place:\n[root] # ulimit -n unlimited\nbash: ulimit: open files: cannot modify limit: Operation not permitted\n\n\n \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21469413&amp;aid=2] If you try to edit the /etc/security/limits.conf file to force unlimited for the number of open files, this will still be considered invalid and it will be reset to 0. This will prevent any new processes from spawning by that user or group. If this is the root user, the system will slowly die as new processes will be unable to generate. A recovery disc will be needed to reset the value. \n\n\n\n\nOn Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, why are my settings for nproc (ulimit -u) not being honored. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 has introduced a configuration file, addressed in a bug report [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=919793], ( /etc/security/limits.d/90-nproc.conf ) that overrides the nproc setting in the limits.conf. This file contains a line for nproc configured with a soft limit of 1024. \n\n* soft nproc 1024 \n\nThe rationale for this was to prevent fork bombs from occurring, To keep using the limits.conf for your nproc ulimit settings, you would need to comment this line out by making the first character on the line a hash/pound symbol. \n\n#* soft nproc 1024 \n \n\nI am using an /etc/init.d script (or inittab) to start my application server and setting the global ulimit settings had no effect? The global settings for ulimit will not take effect if the init process starts the application server or nodeagent because it has yet to load the global settings. The global settings take effect once a login terminal session is started, or when a user logs in to the system, not when the init process spawns new processes based on init.d scripts. At startup, the operating system hasn't begun to load specific profiles up, even the root user. When you see individual services and processes starting, these are all child processes of the init process \n\nThis was previously documented for AIX 6.1 in the following Knowledge Center article entitled \"telinit or init Command\", under the Environments section. Here's the quoted section: \n\n\"A command that is executed by init from the /etc/inittab file uses init's ulimit values and not the default values as given in /etc/security/limits. The result is that a command that is successfully executed from the command line may not execute correctly when invoked by init.

This increased transaction time can lead to an error situation if either of the following timeouts is exceeded: \n\n * the total and/or maximum transaction lifetime timeout value(s) for the server \n * the WCM component's transaction timeout\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nSystemOut.log may show the following: \n\nExample #1:\n\n[9/10/12 10:08:43:757 AMT] 0000001a TimeoutManage I WTRN0006W: Transaction 00000139B080F02D0000000236122A9CB64A65E5C73B006CE4605EA6BEA57CC3F6A1783B00000139B080F02D0000000236122A9CB64A65E5C73B006CE4605EA6BEA57CC3F6A1783B00000001 has timed out after 120 seconds.\n\n[datestamp] 00000055 JTATransactio E RT0025E: Failed to save user transaction\ncom.ibm.icm.ci.CDMTransactionException\nat com.ibm.icm.ci.JCRUserTransaction.commit(JCRUserTransaction.java:189)\nat com.ibm.icm.ci.JTATransaction.commit(JTATransaction.java:166)\nat com.ibm.icm.jcr.RepositoryImpl.deleteWorkspace(RepositoryImpl.java:804)\nat com.ibm.wps.wcm.vpmapping.JcrWorkspaceVirtualPortalHandler$2.run(JcrWorkspaceVirtualPortalHandler.java:336)\n....\nCaused by: javax.transaction.RollbackException\nat com.ibm.tx.jta.impl.TransactionImpl.stage3CommitProcessing(TransactionImpl.java:1254)\n....\n\n[datestamp] 00000055 DeleteVPComma E com.ibm.wps.command.vp.DeleteVPCommand AbstractCommand.throwCommandException EJPEB0804E: DeleteVPCommand: An exception in the data backend occurred.\ncom.ibm.portal.resolver.exceptions.LocalizedIOException: EJPFB0002E: Exception occurred.\nat com.ibm.wps.wcm.vpmapping.JcrWorkspaceVirtualPortalHandler.onVirtualPortalDeleted(JcrWorkspaceVirtualPortalHandler.java:348)\n....\nCaused by: javax.transaction.RollbackException\nat com.ibm.tx.jta.impl.TransactionImpl.stage3CommitProcessing(TransactionImpl.java:1254)\n.... \n\nExample #2: \n\n[datestamp] 000000f4 TimeoutManage I WTRN0006W: Transaction PA_MageVirtualPortals#MgeVirtualPortals.war#ManageVirtualPortals 00000143FA0D566200000001680EB7144589A0582D368B51A9A958DDACFF4F62EA89D95C00000143FA0D566200000001680EB7144589A0582D368B51A9A958DDACFF4F62EA89D95C00000001 has timed out after 120 seconds.\n[datestamp] 000000f4 TimeoutManage I WTRN0124I: When the timeout occurred the thread with which the transaction is, or was most recently, associated was Thread[WebContainer : 8,5,main].

Increase the total transaction lifetime timeout and maximum transaction timeout values (for example, to 600 seconds or greater) using the instructions in the Related information section below. \n\n2. If the problem persists after addressing the change in suggestion #1 and the error in SystemOut.log shows that the timeout still occurs after 120 seconds (as opposed to the increased value that you just set), then update to Cumulative Fix (CF) 9 or later to get the fix for APAR PI04872 and then add (or update if already exists) the following custom property to the WCM_WCMConfigService Resource Environment Provider: \n\nName: wcm.transaction.timeout \n\nValue: 600 (for example) \n\nNote: There is not a target value for a transaction timeouts that applies to every customer environment. The goal should be to find a value that allows the virtual portal deletion to succeed but does not introduce significant delay in being alerted for other transaction timeouts.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n#Transaction settings [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tjta_settlog.html]\nPI04872 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI04872]\nSetting Resource Environment Provider custom properties [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Setting_service_configuration_properties_wp8]", "content_type": "text", "id": "swg21611073"}, "is_correct_answer": true, "is_correct_document": true, "origin": "gold-label", "answer": {"answer": "With the introduction of Managed Pages in WebSphere Portal 8.0, virtual portal deletions require more transaction time when removing from the system.

This document assumes that all prequisites of an operating system and the Java runtime environment are correctly implemented and are at the correct level in relation to the ISAM Runtime for Java version. \n\n \n\n1) Verify the license file. \n\nExample command:\ncat /opt/PolicyDirector/.configure/PDlic.txt\n\n\nExample output:\nAccess Manager License fileset version 7.0.0.0\n\n\n2) Verify the version of the PD.jar used in the configuration command. \n\nExample command:\nunzip -p /opt/PolicyDirector/java/export/pdjrte/PD.jar META-INF/MANIFEST.MF |grep \"Implementation-Version\" \n\nExample output:\nImplementation-Version: 7.0.0.0\n\n\n3) Verify from which location the PD.jar is loaded. \n\nUse Java command option -verbose:class with the \"PDJrteCfg -action config\" command. \n\nExample command:\n/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/jre/bin/java -verbose:class-Dpd.home=/opt/PolicyDirector/ -cp /opt/PolicyDirector/java/export/pdjrte/PD.jar com.tivoli.pd.jcfg.PDJrteCfg -action config -java_home /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/jre -host <Policy Server host name> -port 7135 -domain Default -config_type full -cfgfiles_path /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/tivoli/tam -alt_config\n\n\nExample output ( exerpt of the output ):\n...\nclass load: com.tivoli.pd.jcfg.IPDJrteCfg from: file:/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/jre/lib/ext/PD.jar\nclass load: com.tivoli.pd.jutil.IPDPathConstants from: file:/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/jre/lib/ext/PD.jar\nclass load: com.tivoli.pd.jcfg.IPDJrteCfgConstants from: file:/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/jre/lib/ext/PD.jar\nclass load: com.tivoli.pd.jcfg.PDJrteCfg from: file:/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/jre/lib/ext/PD.jar\nclass load: com.tivoli.pd.jutil.PDPrintStream from: file:/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/jre/lib/ext/PD.jar\n...\n\n\n4) Compare the location of the PD.jar defined versus what has been used. \n\nThe Java command option -cp defines the classpath used with the \"PDJrteCfg -action config\" command: \n\n-cp /opt/PolicyDirector/java/export/pdjrte/PD.jar. \n\nAs per the output above classes are loaded from different location than what was defined by the classpath option: \n\n/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/jre/lib/ext/PD.jar \n\n \n\n5) Check the PD.jar version that was used while running the \"PDJrteCfg -action config\" command. \n\nExample:\nunzip -p /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/jre/lib/ext/PD.jar META-INF/MANIFEST.MF |grep \"Implementation-Version\" \n\nOutput:\nImplementation-Version: 6.1.0.7\n\n\nA mismatch between the PD.jar file ( 6.1.0.7 ) and the license file ( 7.0.0.0 ) versions is causing the \"Access Manager License Fileset not correct\" error message.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nIn this case it is important to understand in which order class files are loaded by the class loaders when a java application is executed. The Java classes are loaded in the following order: \n\n1. Bootstrap class loader ( $JAVAHOME/jre/lib/rt.jar ) \n\n2. Extension class loader ( $JAVAHOME/jre/lib/ext/*.jar ) \n\n3. System class loader ( $CLASSPATH ) \n\n \n\nIn effect, these three search paths are joined to form a simple class path. In the example of \"PDJrteCfg -action config\" command above the Java command line option -cp was given. Intention was to override the \"full classpath\" and use the correct version of the PD.jar file. Based on the Java rules -cp option does override the CLASSPATH environment variable but -cp option does not affect the bootstrap or extension class loaders. The classpath ( defined either by the CLASSPATH environment variable or by the -cp option ) is searched only if a class to be loaded hasn't been found by the bootstrap or extension class loaders. In the example case classes were loaded by the extension class loader and therefore an old version of the PD.jar file was used. See the links in the Related information section for more details about the Java class loading. \n\n \n\nFixing the problem: \n\n1. Remove any PD.jar files from the extension directory ( $JAVAHOME/jre/lib/ext/ ). \n\nExample\nrm /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/java/jre/lib/ext/PD.jar\n\n2.

All other credentials for other namespaces are not updated.\n   \n * Off: Credentials are not updated in any namespace.\n   \n * All namespaces: When you log on to the first namespace, your credentials are updated as described for \"Primary namespace only\". When you log on to additional namespaces, if your trusted credentials associated with the primary account contain logon information for that namespace, then those trusted credentials are updated. NOTE: Do not use the All namespaces option if users authenticate into secondary namespaces as different users.\n\n\nA user's trusted credentials for a namespace will only be renewed once per day. \n\nIt is NOT possible to use SSO with the feature 'Automatically Renew Trusted Credentials' found in Cognos BI. The reason for this is due to the following: \n\n\"A trusted credential is special because the namespace credentials it stores must be usable at any time, not depending on any timestamp. This rules out SSO tickets like Kerberos tokens or SAP tokens as they will expire after a short time and will become unusable. A suitable trusted credential therefore usually is a pair consisting of a user name and a password. However, for SSO based authentication to IBM Cognos BI, there is no password available to the namespace that can be stored into the trusted credential. Therefore, this feature will only work for basic authentication, when the user provides a user name and password to the login screen.\" RELATED INFORMATION\n Proven Practices: Securing the IBM Cognos 10 BI Environ [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/data/library/cognos/security/cognos_bi_platform/page602.html]\nCognos Analytics 11 Equivalent Technote [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21998776]", "content_type": "text", "id": "swg21591076"}, "is_correct_answer": true, "is_correct_document": true, "origin": "gold-label", "answer": {"answer": "For IBM Cognos Business Intelligence(BI) deployments that do not implement a single sign-on (SSO) solution, stored credentials used for running scheduled activities can be automatically updated.

Use these files to roll back. In version 10.2.1 FP1 and above there is no option to create a backup, instead backups are automatically created in the <cognos_install>/bkp directory.\nNote that the backup directories only contain copies of all individual files that were modified by the fix pack or interim fix, not the entire contents of the original directory.\n\nCare must also be taken when removing interim fixes to ensure that there weren't later interim fixes applied which also contain some of the same files.

Due to native OutOfMemory error, I would like to remove that default, so there is no such limitation imposed on my native memory size. ", "document": {"content": " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n \"Why does the JVM report a native out-of-memory (NOOM) when using compressed references? I am using a 64bit JVM and I clearly have plenty of memory left. How can I resolve this problem?\" \n\nCAUSE\n \n\n*In this note, please refer to Java Versioning: Java Version.Release.ServiceRelease.FixPack \nex: Java 7.1.4.6 is the same as Java 7.1 SR4 FP6 is the same as Java 7 R1 SR4 FP6. \nThe IBM JVM will automatically use compressed references [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/understanding/mm_compressed_references.html]when using a maximum heap size less than 25GB. This automated behavior was introduced in Java 6.1.5.0 and Java 7.0.4.0*. Compressed references (CR) decreases the size of Java objects making better use of available memory space. This better use of space results in improved JVM performance. *(Java 7.0.1.1 and later uses compressed references by default on z/OS) \n\nSee Introducing WebSphere Compressed Reference Technology [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf] for detailed information on how Compressed References work. \n\n\"When using compressed references, the size of the field used in the Java object for the Class Pointer and the Monitor/Lock is 32 bits instead of the 64bits that would be available in non-compressed mode. Because we are using 32 bits to store the location of these, and they are located in native (non-Java heap) memory, they must be allocated in the first 4GB of the address space - the maximum range we can address with the 32 bits.\" ~IBM Java Development Team \n\nIf the Java heap itself is small (-Xmx), the JVM may allocate it in the lower 4GB of address space along with the Class Pointers and Monitors/Locks. If these Class Pointers, Monitors/Locks and Java heap (if included) cannot fit in the lower 4GB, a native out of memory (NOOM) [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-nativememory-linux/] will be thrown. \nANSWER\nWhy Use Compressed References? \n\nBelow the 4GB mark, the JVM does not have to perform any compression/decompression of the address pointer at runtime. Therefore, the best performance will be attained if the Class Pointers, Monitors/Locks and Java heap can all be contained comfortably within the lowest 4GB of the address space. \n\n \n\nDetermining Address Location of Java Heap Memory \n\nTo verify if the Java heap has memory regions below the 4GB mark, check the \"Object Memory\" section in the javacore:\n\nConvert the \"start\" address from the hex value to a GB value [http://ss64.com/convert.html]. In the example below, 0x000000000F010000=0.23GB which is below the the 4GB (0x0000000100000000) mark.\n\n\n\n * [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=1]\n\n\nSetting the Preferred Heap Base with -Xgc:preferredHeapBase \n\nStarting with Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0, and later, the JVM will determine if the Java heap will fit comfortably in the lower 4GB. If it is too large, the JVM will automatically allocate the Java heap above the 4GB mark (APAR IV37797 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV37797]). \n\n\n\nNOTE: In IBM System z platforms (i.e. z/OS and z/Linux), automatic shift of the heap above the 4GB address space does NOT occur because on these platforms, there is an additional performance penalty \nassociated with higher shift values. To resolve Native OOM issues due to a shortage of heap memory in the lower region on z platforms, use -Xnocompressedrefs (see below). \nSee related: IBM Knowledge Center - JVMJ9GC089W [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_7.0.0/com.ibm.java.messages/diag/appendixes/messages/j9gc/message_jvmj9gc089.html] However, in earlier Java 6.1 and Java 7.0 versions (earlier than Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0), if the Java heap can not fit in the lower 4GB, a NOOM will occur. To avoid this problem, the generic JVM argument [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365] -Xgc:preferredHeapBase=<address> [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/understanding/mm_compressed_references.html] can be used to ensure the Java heap is allocated above the 4GB address space. This will leave more room for the Class Pointer and Monitor/Lock memory. \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * This will locate the Java heap starting at the 4GB mark thus leaving the lower 4GB for the other processes.\n\n\nIncrease Maximum Heap Size to Force Heap Allocation Above the 4GB mark \n\nAnother way to ensure that the heap is allocated above the 4GB mark (Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0 and later) is to set a maximum heap size equal to or greater than 4GB. For example -Xmx4G will ensure that the heap will have to be allocated above the 4GB mark. This will not work in earlier versions of the JVM since these earlier versions allowed the heap to straddle the 4GB mark, placing part of the memory above and some below (fixed as part of APAR IV37797) . \n\n \n\nFurther Investigation \n\nIf after setting -Xgc:preferredHeapBase=<address> or -Xmx4G a NOOM is still encountered (Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0 and later), then further investigation is required at the application level. Look to decrease the size and usage of the applications Class Pointers and Monitors/Locks. Additionally, there are some WebSphere Application Server troubleshooting methods that may help reduce the native memory footprint. See: IBM Troubleshooting native memory issues [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21373312].\n\nReserving Low-Memory Space with -Xmcrs\n\nIf there is still free memory in the system when a Native OutOfMemory (NOOM) occurs, then the problem may be a shortage of memory in the low-memory region (under 4GB). Even if the Java heap is located above this boundary, other data associated with Java objects can be located in the low-memory region.\n\nThe OS memory allocator will deal out low-memory freely, thus memory resources in the lower boundary may run out. Later when the JVM tries to allocate memory for an artifact which is required to be allocated in low-memory (because the JVM has only reserved a 32bit pointer for it) it fails and throws an OutOfMemoryError.\n\nStarting in Java 6.0.16.3, Java 6.1.8.3, Java 7.0.8.10, Java 7.1.2.10, there is a parameter -Xmcrs [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_6.0.0/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/appendixes/cmdline/xmcrs.html] which allows the JVM to increase the amount of low memory it reserves on startup. With this setting, as long as the low-memory usage by the JVM does not exceed the -Xmcrs value, NOOM in the lower boundary will be avoided.\n\nTo set this parameter, first decide what a reasonable value for your lower memory requirements may be. Reasonable value is unique to each environment so there is not a general recommendation.\n\n\n * -Xmcrs<reasonable_value_for_lower_memory>\n\n * \n * NATIVEMEMINFO subcomponent dump routine\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=2]\n * \n\n\nDisabling Compressed References with -Xnocompressedrefs As a last resort, if the native memory still can not be contained under the 4GB mark, you can set -Xnocompressedrefs [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/appendixes/cmdline/Xnocompressedrefs.html] as a generic JVM argument. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365] Using -Xnocompressedrefs will remove the use of compressed references and therefore remove the lower 4GB memory restriction on the Class Pointers and Monitors/Locks. This will however, result in a significant increase in Java heap memory requirements. It is not uncommon for 70% more heap space to be required. Due to the increased memory requirements it is strongly advised that the Java heap size is adjusted to a larger value and garbage collection is monitored and retuned as required.\n\nAdditionally, some benchmarks show a 10-20% relative throughput decrease when disabling compressed references: \"Analysis shows that a 64-bit application without CR yields only 80-85% of 32-bit throughput but with CR yields 90-95%. Depending on application requirements, CR can improve performance up to 20% over standard 64-bit.\" See:ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf].\n\nBefore using -Xnocompressedrefs as a solution, first rule out the possibility of a native memory leak. Since using -Xnocompressedrefs will allow the the native memory to grow unbounded, a leak in native memory will lead to process size growth eventually leading to a process that needs to be paged out.

", "document": {"content": "6.30.05.00 CANDLEHOME CANDLEDATA itmCANDLEDATA.sh TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How do I move local data such as configuration files, log files, historical data, etc. from CANDLEHOME to a different file system? \n\nCAUSE\nSince its inception, IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM) has stored local data such as configuration files, log files, and historical data together with the installation files in CANDLEHOME. For example, ITM normally installs in a directory named /opt/IBM/ITM. Within that directory, it stores programs in subdirectory names like /opt/IBM/ITM/bin and /opt/IBM/ITM/classes. It also stores local data in subdirectory names like /opt/IBM/ITM/config and /opt/IBM/ITM/logs. This homogeneous design is a problem for installations that require an approach that keeps code in /opt and stores data in the /var file system.\n\nANSWER\nIntroduction \n\nUnder APAR IV67523, ITM added a new mechanism to move local data to a different file system. For example, data typically stored in /opt/IBM/ITM/config and /opt/IBM/ITM/logs can be redirected to /var/IBM/ITM/config and /var/IBM/ITM/logs. This new file system location is designated by the user at installation time, and it is referred to as CANDLEDATA. A conversion utility is provided to implement CANDLEDATA for existing installations. \n\nThe CANDLEDATA mechanism is available with ITM 6.30.05.00. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow CANDLEDATA Works \n\nThe CANDLEDATA mechanism is implemented primarily using symbolic links. This means most of the underlying code in ITM is unaware of CANDLEDATA. This also means the CANDLEDATA mechanism is limited to Linux and UNIX platforms. \n\nThe rest of this section shows examples of links where CANDLEHOME=/opt/IBM/ITM and CANDLEDATA=/var/IBM/ITM. You can define different locations for your own installation. \n\n \n\nBase Directory Links \n\nThe following local data directories are always linked from CANDLEHOME to CANDLEDATA:\n\n\n * /opt/IBM/ITM/InstallITM -> /var/IBM/ITM/InstallITM\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/config -> /var/IBM/ITM/config\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/kt1v3depot -> /var/IBM/ITM/kt1v3depot\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/localconfig -> /var/IBM/ITM/localconfig\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/logs -> /var/IBM/ITM/logs\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/patchlogs -> /var/IBM/ITM/patchlogs\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/tables -> /var/IBM/ITM/tables\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/tmaitm6/agentdepot -> /var/IBM/ITM/tmaitm6/agentdepot\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/tmp -> /var/IBM/ITM/tmp\n\nThese directories and links are automatically generated by ITM when the system is installed or converted to use CANDLEDATA. \n\n \n\nGeneral Agent Directory Links \n\nIn addition to the base set of directory links, most agents have general links for TEMA data:\n\n\n * /opt/IBM/ITM/ATTRLIB -> /var/IBM/ITM/ATTRLIB\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/<platform>/<pc>/tables/ATTRLIB -> /var/IBM/ITM/ATTRLIB/<pc>\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/EIFLIB -> /var/IBM/ITM/EIFLIB\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/<platform>/<pc>/tables/EIFLIB -> /var/IBM/ITM/EIFLIB/<pc>\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/hist -> /var/IBM/ITM/hist\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/<platform>/<pc>/hist -> /var/IBM/ITM/hist/<pc>\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/psit -> /var/IBM/ITM/psit\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM/<platform>/<pc>/psit -> /var/IBM/ITM/psit/<pc>\n\n\nThese directories and links are automatically generated by ITM when the agent is converted to use CANDLEDATA.  \n\nSpecial Agent Directory Links \n\nSome agents have links that are specific to that agent. For example, the LZ and UX agents create the following link for the Watchdog component to store local data:\n\n\n * /opt/IBM/ITM/kca -> /var/IBM/ITM/kca\n\n\nThese directories and links are automatically generated by ITM when the agent is converted to use CANDLEDATA.  \n\nCANDLEDATA <-> CANDLEHOME Directory Links \n\nThe CANDLEHOME and CANDLEDATA directories also have cross references to each other:\n\n\n * /opt/IBM/IBM/registry/CANDLEDATA -> /var/IBM/ITM\n * \n * /opt/IBM/ITM <- /var/IBM/ITM/CANDLEHOME\n\n\nThese links are all automatically generated by ITM when the system is installed or converted to use CANDLEDATA.  \n\nConfiguration Variables exploited by CANDLEDATA \n\nIn addition to symbolic links, some individual components have special configuration settings to redirect agent-specific data to CANDLEDATA. ITM redirects data using the following configuration variables:\n\n\n * CTIRA_SIT_PATH\n * \n * CANDLEHOME/\n * <platform>/<pc>/psit\n * \n * \n * KCA_IP_DIR\n * \n * CANDLEHOME/kca\n * \n * \n * KCAWD_WRITE_DIR \n * \n * CANDLEHOME/kca\n * \n * \n\nNotes:  1. While the variables point to CANDLEHOME/xxx, the directory links cause the local data to be written to the corresponding CANDLEDATA/xxx. \n 2. If you use configuration overrides that set these configuration variables, you'll need to review how those overrides work in an environment configured to use CANDLEDATA. In most cases, you'll want to remove your overrides.\n\n\nConfiguration Variables affected by CANDLEDATA\nThe symbolic links established by ITM for CANDLEDATA assume standard agent configuration. If you've modified any of the following, data will be continue to be redirected to the location you specified instead of the CANDLEDATA directory:\n. \n\n * ATTRLIB\n * \n * CTIRA_HIST_DIR\n * \n * EIFLIB\n * \n * \n\nWhen converting an existing CANDLEHOME, ITM migrates any data in the original directories before linking them to CANDLEDATA. If you've modified any of the following, you must consider whether you need to change the setting and migrate the data manually: \n.  * CTIRA_SIT_FILE\n * \n * \n\nBy default, all of the following configuration variables direct data to /opt/IBM/ITM/localconfig. ITM migrates data from /opt/IBM/ITM/localconfig to /var/IBM/ITM/localconfig and then links the two. If you've modified any of these, you must consider whether you need to change the setting and migrate the data manually: \n.  * CTIRA_THRESHOLDS \n * \n * IRA_EVENT_EXPORT_SNMP_TRAP_CONFIG\n * \n * \n * IRA_LOCALCONFIG_DIR\n * \n * \n * IRA_PRIVATE_SITUATION_CONFIG\n * \n * \n * IRA_SERVICE_INTERFACE_DEFAULT_PAGE\n * \n * \n * IRA_SERVICE_INTERFACE_DIR\n * \n * \n * KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS \n\n\n\n\n\nKnown Restrictions\n\n\n 1.  The CANDLEDATA mechanism is available only for ITM on Linux and UNIX. ITM on Windows continues to keep local data under CANDLEHOME. \n     . \n 2.  No facility is provided switch from a CANDLEHOME+CANDLEDATA implementation back to a unified CANDLEHOME implementation. To do this, you must uninstall and reinstall ITM.\n     . \n 3.  No facility is provided to move CANDLEDATA from one directory to another. To do this, you must uninstall and reinstall ITM.\n     . \n 4.  The CANDLEHOME and CANDLEDATA arrangement is a 1:1 relationship.  * Only one CANDLEHOME can use a given CANDLEDATA. This means a given CANDLEDATA cannot be shared with multiple CANDLEHOMEs. \n      * A given CANDLEHOME can only use one CANDLEDATA. This means components cannot be split amongst multiple CANDLEDATAs.\n        .\n     \n     \n 5.  The monitoring server and portal server cannot exploit CANDLEDATA.  * The conversion utility will not convert an existing CANDLEHOME if it contains the monitoring server or portal server. \n      * The installer warns if CANDLEDATA is specified and the install image contains the monitoring server or portal server. However, the installer does not prevent monitoring server or portal server from being installed. \n      * ITM does not allow the monitoring server to start if CANDLEDATA is implemented. \n      * ITM does not allow the portal server to start if CANDLEDATA is implemented.\n        .\n     \n     \n 6.  Not all agents have been verified to work with CANDLEDATA. Before using CANDLEDATA, check with the support group for each of the agents you intend to install.\n     . \n 7.  System Monitor Agents (SMA) can exploit CANDLEDATA. However, the SMA installer does not create CANDLEDATA. These agents must be converted to use CANDLEDATA after they are installed.\n     . \n 8.  The CANDLEDATA mechanism is intended only for current agents. If the agent media contains installer 6.30.00.00 or above, it should be ok to use with CANDLEDATA. \n     \n     Some older or discontinued agents such as the Universal Agent (UM) and UNIX Logs agent (UL) cannot use CANDLEDATA reliably. ITM does not prevent older or discontinued agents from being installed into a new CANDLEHOME with CANDLEDATA implemented. \n     . \n 9.  When CANDLEDATA is in use, ITM implements internal overrides for the following configuration variables: CTIRA_SIT_PATH, KCA_IP_DIR, and KCAWD_WRITE_DIR.  * If you've already overridden any of these configuration variables, you must remove the overrides before converting a given component. \n      * If you've overridden these with CANDLEHOME/config/xx.environment, the conversion utility will detect and warn about them. Your overrides will win, so you must remove them. \n      * If you've overridden these with the old method of sourcing a script into CANDLEHOME/config/xx.ini, the conversion utility cannot detect them. However, the CANDLEDATA overrides will win.\n        .\n     \n     \n 10. The prerequisite scanner does not know about CANDLEDATA. It continues to assume everything is stored in CANDLEHOME. This means:  * No space checking is performed for CANDLEDATA. \n      * Results are somewhat inflated for CANDLEHOME.\n        .\n     \n     \n 11. The conversion utility does not check for space when converting an existing new CANDLEHOME to use CANDLEDATA. Make sure there is enough space in CANDLEDATA before starting the conversion process. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgents Verified with CANDLEDATA\n\nThe following agents have been verified to run properly when CANDLEDATA is implemented:\n\n\n * LO\n * \n * \n * LZ\n * \n * \n * UD\n * \n * \n * UX\n * \n * \n\nFor other agents, contact the corresponding support team.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting Up a New Local Installation with CANDLEDATA\n\nFor new installations, you can define the location for local data at installation time.\n\nLocal install (interactive):\n\n\n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * CANDLEHOME\n * \n * \n * \n * # ./install.sh\n * \n * INSTALL\n * \n * \n * Enter the name of the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory.\n * \n * [ default = /opt/IBM/ITM ]:\n * \n * \"/opt/IBM/ITM\" does not exist\n * \n * Try to create it [ 1-yes, 2-no; \"1\" is default ]?\n * \n * Creating directory \"/opt/IBM/ITM\"...\n * \n * \n * Enter the name of the IBM Tivoli Monitoring local data directory.\n * \n * [ default = /opt/IBM/ITM ]: /var/IBM/ITM\n * \n * \"/var/IBM/ITM\" does not exist\n * \n * Try to create it [ 1-yes, 2-no; \"1\" is default ]?\n * \n * Creating directory \"/var/IBM/ITM\"...\n * \n * itmCANDLEDATA.sh: Installation directory \"/opt/IBM/ITM\" successfully converted to use data directory \"/var/IBM/ITM\".\n * \n * \n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * CANDLEHOME\n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * CANDLEHOME\n * \n * CANDLEHOME\n * \n\n\nLocal install (silent): \n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * \n * \n * install.sh \n   [-l \n * CANDLEDATA\n * ] \n *  \n   Where:  * -l\n    * \n    * CANDLEHOME\n    * \n   \n   \n * \n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * install.sh\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * CANDLEHOME\n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * install.sh\n * \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting an agent for the first time with CANDLEDATA \n\nWhen you specify CANDLEDATA at install time, ITM establishes the base directory links. All agent-specific conversion is handled the first time a given agent is started. When this happens, an extra message is included in the agent start output: Here is an example:\n\n# itmcmd agent start ux\nProcessing. Please wait...\nitmCANDLEDATA.sh: Component ux successfully converted to use data directory \"/var/IBM/ITM\".\nStarting Monitoring Agent for UNIX OS ...\nMonitoring Agent for UNIX OS started \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConverting an existing installation or new agents to use CANDLEDATA \n\nFor existing installations, ITM provides a utility to convert a CANDLEHOME to use CANDLEDATA. You can also use this utility to convert a newly installed agent before it is started. Under the covers, the installer runs this same utility. \n\nitmCANDLEDATA.sh\n[-b yes|no] \n[-h CANDLEHOME] \n[-l CANDLEDATA] \n[-f no|yes] \n[-p PC|*]\n[-r no|yes] \n\nWhere: \n\n * \n * -b\n * \n * yes\n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * CANDLEHOME\n * \n * CANDLEHOME\n * \n * no\n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * \n * \n * -h\n * \n * \n * \n * -l\n * \n * CANDLEHOME\n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * \n * \n * -f\n * \n * no\n * \n * yes\n * \n * \n * \n * -p\n * \n * *\n * \n * \n * \n * -r\n * \n * no\n * \n * yes\n * \n\n\nIf you set the CANDLEHOME or CANDLEDATA environment variables before launching the installer, then those values are used as though they had been passed with the command options. If both the command option is used and the environment variable is defined before the conversion utility is started, the command option takes precedence. \n\nExample 1: Conversion of a typical CANDLEHOME can be performed with an incantation similar to this:  * \n * itmCANDLEDATA.sh -l /var/IBM/ITM -b yes -p \"*\" -r yes\n\n\nExample 2: Conversion of a newly installed agent to a CANDLEHOME where CANDLEDATA is already implemented can be performed with an incantation similar to this:  * \n * itmCANDLEDATA.sh -b no -p \"ux\" -r yes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing CANDLEDATA with Remote Deploy\n\nYou can define the location for local data remotely:\n\ntacmd createnode (new installations):\n\n\n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * \n * \n * tacmd createnode ... -o ENV_CANDLEDATA=\n * data_directory\n * ...\n * \n * \n * \n * install.sh\n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * \n\ntacmd executecommand + itmCANDLEDATA.sh (existing installations): \n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * tacmd updateagent\n * \n * CANDLEDATA\n * \n * tacmd executecommand\n * \n * \n * \n * tacmd executecommand ... -c \"/opt/IBM/ITM/bin/itmCANDLEDATA.sh -l /var/IBM/ITM -p \\\"*\\\" -b yes -r yes > /tmp/itmCANDLEDATA_remote.log 2>&1 &\"\n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  Launches the conversion utility on the agent (/opt/IBM/ITM/bin/itmCANDLEDATA.sh). Specifies the local data directory (-l /var/IBM/ITM). Specifies all agents are to be converted (-p \\\"*\\\"). Note that the quotes are escaped because the entire command string is quoted. Specifies the CANDLEDATA directory is to be built (-b yes). Specifies the agents are to be restarted (-r yes). Redirects STDOUT and STDERR to a log file (> /tmp/itmCANDLEDATA_remote.log 2>&1). Note that the standard -o/-e/-d/-v options for tacmd executecommand don't function properly because of the agent restart. Note also that /tmp is used instead of /opt/IBM/ITM/logs; the latter is moved during the conversion process and therefore must be inactive. Launches the command in the background (trailing &). tacmd executecommand waits for the commands to complete, and this is signaled by a communication from the agent. However, since the agent is restarted by the command, it will never reply to tacmd executecommand. Running the command in the background allows tacmd executecommand to complete normally. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Implications \n\nThe following general ITM utilities have been updated to run properly when CANDLEDATA is implemented: \n\n * cinfo - The output heading indicates the location of CANDLEDATA if it implemented. \n * itmcmd agent start - Agent configurations are automatically updated if CANDLEDATA is implemented. Also, the portal server is prevented from starting if CANDLEDATA is implemented. \n * itmcmd server start - The monitoring server is prevented from starting if CANDLEDATA is implemented. \n * secureMain - Permissions and ownership in CANDLEDATA are maintained just as in CANDLEHOME. If secureMain was run before CANDLEDATA is implemented, the conversion utility automatically runs secureMain again as part of the conversion process. However, if you run the conversion utility as a nonroot user (not recommended), you must run secureMain manually after conversion is complete. \n * tacmd pdcollect and pdcollect - Data is gathered from CANDLEDATA just as from CANDLEHOME. \n * uninstall.sh - Relevant data is removed from in CANDLEDATA just as from CANDLEHOME.

From this location, locate theweb.xmlfiles in the following directories: \n\n * For the Integrated Solutions Console web application archive:isc.ear/deployments/isc/isclite.war/WEB-INF \n * For the Charts web application archive:isc.ear/deployments/isc/TIPChartPortlet.war/WEB-INF \n * For the Dashboard Application Services Hub Change Password web application archive:isc.ear/deployments/isc/TIPChangePasswd.war/WEB-INF\n\n\n3. Open one of the web.xmlfiles using a text editor. 4. Find the<transport-guarantee>element. The initial value of all<transport-guarantee>elements isCONFIDENTIAL, meaning that secure access is always required. \n\n5. Change the setting toNONEto enable both HTTP and HTTPS requests. The element now reads:<transport-guarantee>NONE</transport-guarantee>. \n\n6. Save the file, and then repeat these steps for the otherweb.xmldeployment files. \n\n7. Stop and restart the server. [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEKCU_1.1.2.1/com.ibm.psc.doc/admin/psc_ctr_admin_restart_jazzsm_servers.html] \n\nExample \n\nThe following example is a section of theweb.xmlfile forTIPChangePasswdwhere the transport-guarantee parameter is set toNONE:\n<security-constraint>\n<display-name>\nChangePasswdControllerServletConstraint</display-name>\n<web-resource-collection>\n<web-resource-name>ChangePasswdControllerServlet</web-resource-name>\n<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>\n</web-resource-collection>\n<auth-constraint>\n<description>Roles</description>\n<role-name>administrator</role-name>\n<role-name>operator</role-name>\n<role-name>configurator</role-name>\n<role-name>monitor</role-name>\n<role-name>iscadmins</role-name>\n</auth-constraint>\n<user-data-constraint>\n<transport-guarantee>NONE</transport-guarantee>\n</user-data-constraint>\n</security-constraint> \n\nWhat to do next \n\nUsers must now specify a different port, depending on the mode of access. The default port numbers are as follows:\nhttp://<host_name>:16310/ibm/console\nUse the HTTP port for logging in to the Dashboard Application Services Hub on the HTTP port .\nhttps://<host_name>:16311/ibm/console\nUse the HTTPS secure port for logging in to the Dashboard Application Services Hub. \n\nNote:If you want to use single sign-on (SSO) then you must use the fully qualified domain name of the Dashboard Application Services Hub host.", "content_type": "text", "id": "swg21974566"}, "is_correct_answer": true, "is_correct_document": true, "origin": "gold-label", "answer": {"answer": "By default, the Jazz\u2122 for Service Management application server requires HTTPS access.

This is okay as long as you do not change the Java package that was installed with WebSphere under /ibm/WebSphere/AppServer/java. \n\nThe Engine and Client tiers will also be safe if you do not change the Java package in the /InformationServer/ASBNode/apps/jre directory. \n\nInformation Server 8.1 ships with Java 1.4.2. And applying Fix Pack 1 (8.1.0.1) upgrades the Java level used by Information Server to IBM Java 1.5.0. The level of java within WebSphere Application Server is unaffected by the Information Server 8.1 fix packs so would still be 1.4.2. \n\nInformation Server 8.5 ships with Java 1.6.0.

Only customers who have purchased Operational Decision Manager V8.5.1 can use this fix pack.\n\n\nHow to install the fix pack\nIf you are not installing both Operational Decision Manager components, skip the instructions regarding Decision Center or Decision Server.\n\n\n 1. For Decision Center, download 8.5.1-WS-ODM_DC-<OS>-FP002.zip, and extract its files. (Change <OS> to match your platform: AIX, HPUX, LINUX, OS400, SOLARIS, ZOS, or WIN32.) \n 2. Extract the archive to a new folder, named WDC. \n 3. For Decision Server, Download 8.5.1-WS-ODM_DS-<OS>-FP002.zip, and extract its files. (Change <OS> to match your platform: AIX, HPUX, LINUX, OS400, SOLARIS, ZOS, or WIN32.) \n 4. Extract the archive to a new folder, named WDS.\n\n\nInstalling by using IBM Installation Manager:  1.  Launch IBM Installation Manager. \n 2.  In the toolbar menu, open File > Preferences and do the following: \n 3.  Select repositories. \n 4.  For Decision Center, click Add Repository. \n 5.  Browse to the extracted folder WDC\\updates. \n 6.  Select the file repository.config. \n 7.  For Decision Server, click Add Repository. \n 8.  Browse to the extracted folder WDS\\updates. \n 9.  Select the file repository.config. \n 10. Make sure the repositories are selected in the Repositories list. \n 11. Click Apply to save your changes, and click OK to close the Repositories list. \n 12. Click Update to update your installation. \n 13. Follow the instructions in the installation manager to complete the installation.\n\n\nInstalling by using the Installation Manager command line:  1. Locate the imcl command under <IM installation>/eclipse/tools. \n 2. Run the commandimcl updateAll -repositories WDC/updates,WDS/updates -acceptLicense.\n\n * Use the option -installDirectory <install path of ODM 8.5.1> to update a specific installation. \n * If you update only Decision Server or Decision Center, specify the repository accordingly.\n\n\nApplying the fix pack \nAfter you install the fix pack, you might have to do additional steps to apply the fix pack in your environment. To complete the update, see When and how to apply a modification or fix pack [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21665766]. \n\nWarning: \nIf you have installed interim fixes for Operational Decision Manager V8.5.1, you must uninstall the fixes before you can install this fix pack. You must also stop the Operational Decision Manager sample server for this installation. If you do not uninstall the fixes and stop the server, the installation of the fix pack fails. If you attempt to install the fix pack without uninstalling the interim fixes, the installer uninstalls the interim fixes before the installer fails. In this case, stop the sample server and restart the installation.

In addition, it resolves the APARs and \ndefects listed in the \"Problems Fixed\" section below and includes the\nsuperseded fixes listed in section 2.4.\n\n\n2.0 Problems fixed\n============\nThe following problems are addressed by this fix.\n\n2.1 APARs\n-------------\n\nAPAR: IV96363\nAbstract: AGENT CRASHES ON WINDOWS 2016 WHILE READING LOG\nAdditional information: The agent crashes when a second file close\nattempt follows a successful close of the monitored log.\nAny subsequent I/O operations, such as fseek, fgets, fclose,\netc, either on that thread or another thread using the same\nfile handle may result in a failure or a crash because the\nfile is no longer open or the handle is invalid. The failure\nsometimes results in an fgetpos failure with \"errno 9 'Bad\nfile descriptor'\" and returns with a -1.\n\nThis has been seen more prevalently on Windows 2016 but \nmight occur on other platforms. This is related to IV60331.\n\nOn the agent system, with a minimum of the following trace:\n\"ERROR (UNIT:kumpfile ALL) (UNIT:kum0fdp0 ALL)\" enabled, the\nagent RAS1 log\n<hostname>_lo_[instance]_kloagent_<timestamp>-<nn>.log\nshows trace points similar to the following: \n- - - \n... \n...:kum0fdp0.c,76,\"KUM0_FileClose\") IOE 5619070 file handle\n7C3AB428 File close successful\n...:kum0fdp0.c,111,\"KUM0_FileClose\") SEptr 5613548 local file \nD:/Log/WAS/AppSrv01/nodeagent/SystemOut.log IOptr 5619070 \n7C3AB428 closed unsuccessfully\n...:kum0fdp0.c,82,\"KUM0_FileClose\") File close failed for IOE \n@5619070, status code -1, errno 0 'No error'\n...:kum0fdp0.c,111,\"KUM0_FileClose\") SEptr 5613548 local file \nD:/Log/WAS/AppSrv01/nodeagent/SystemOut.log IOptr 5619070 \n7C3AB428 closed unsuccessfully \n... \n- - - \n\nAPAR: IV95005\nAbstract: \"DETECTED CODEPAGE CP943, USING CP932 INSTEAD TO MAP \nBACKSLASH TO U+005C, NOT U+00A5 (YEN SYMBOL)\" LOGGED ON\nEVERY READ\nAdditional information: With a locale of Ja_JP (Shift-JIS) and\nERROR level trace, when the data is in the local code page,\nthe following message appears in agent RAS1 log for each\nmonitored event processed: \n\"Detected codepage CP943, using CP932 instead to map\nbackslash to U+005C, no U+00A5 (Yen symbol)\". \n\nThis occurs on the agent system, with only ERROR trace\nenabled.

This occurs right after the file has been found\nand matched. (Note: if the monitored file is also found\nlocally, it will succeed and monitor the local file.) \nUsing the same file in LogSources results in a match. \n\nOn the agent system, with a minimum of the following trace:\n\"ERROR (UNIT:kumpdcm2 ALL) (UNIT:kum0dir ALL)\" enabled, the\nagent RAS1 log \n<hostname>_lo_[instance]_kloagent_<timestamp>-<nn>.log shows \ntrace points similar to the following: \n\n- - - \n... \n...:kumpdcm2.c,195,\"KUMP_GetNextMember\") Directory 7F3B3401C380 \n/LFA_test_logs matched <test_1.log> to pattern <^test_1.log$> \n...:kumpdcm2.c,211,\"KUMP_GetNextMember\") Directory handle \n7F3B3401C380 \nname /LFA_test_logs successfully matched <test_1.log> to pattern \n<^test_1.log$> \n...:kumpdcm2.c,217,\"KUMP_GetNextMember\") Exit: 0x0 \n...:kumpdcm2.c,301,\"KUMP_GetNextMemberDouble\") Retcode 0 \nDirectory \n/LFA_test_logs Member <test_1.log> matched ^test_1.log$ \n...:kumpdcm2.c,330,\"KUMP_GetNextMemberDouble\") Directory \n7F3B3401C380 \n/LFA_test_logs member successfully matched <test_1.log> pattern \n<^test_1.log$> \n...:kumpdcm2.c,335,\"KUMP_GetNextMemberDouble\") Exit: 0x0 \n...:kum0dir.c,143,\"KUM0_stat_withMsgFlag\") *** Unable to obtain \nstatistics for file </LFA_test_logs/test_1.log> errno 2 'No such \nfile or directory' \n...:kum0dir.c,192,\"KUM0_stat_withMsgFlag\") Unsuccessfully stat \nfile \n/LFA_test_logs/test_1.log size=0 access time=0, modification \ntime=0, \ncreation time=0 \n...:kumpdcm2.c,481,\"KUMP_DetermineCurrentMonitorFileNameStrict\") \nFile \n/LFA_test_logs/test_1.log skipped, stat failed -1 \n... \n- - - \n\nAPAR: IV89574\nAbstract: INVALID CHARACTERS SEEN IN THE TRACE \"*****Error: \nu_strFromUTF8 failed for string ... - <filename> .........,\nstatus 10 <U_INVALID_CHAR_FOUND>\" \nAdditional information: In the agent RAS1 log, the trace points \n\"*****Error: u_strFromUTF8 failed for string ..... - \n<filename> ..., status 10 <U_INVALID_CHAR_FOUND>\" and \n\"*****Error: uregex_setText failed...\" contain garbled or \ninvalid characters. The garbled characters are not in the\nevents themselves. \n\nSince these messages might occur when the agent is processing\na directory listing in order to determine the current file\nto monitor as a result of a wildcard character in the \nRegexLogSources parameter, if the <filename> that results \nin this error is a file that should be monitored, then events\nwould be lost as the file is not monitored. The <filename> \nis in the directory for RegexLogSources. The additional \ninvalid characters are not seen in the file listing on the\nsystem. \n\nThis was discovered on Log File Agent V6.3 and later on \nWindows, but also occurs on UNIX. \n\nOn the agent system, with a minimum of the following \ntrace enabled: \"ERROR (UNIT:kum0regx ALL)\", the agent RAS1\nlog <hostname>_lo_[instance]_kloagent_<timestamp>-<nn>.log\nshows trace points similar to the following with some extra\ncharacters added \".lnk\": \n----- \n...:kum0regx.c,286,\"KUM0_IsRegExPatternMatch\") \n*****Error: u_strFromUTF8 failed for string \u00e4\u00ab\u00e4\u00a8\u00e4O\u00e4\u00e8\u00e4\u00ec\u00e4j\u00e4\u00ec - \n\u00e4n\u00e4f\u00e4\u00ee\u00e4n .lnk\u00d9l \u00d9s\u00d9w pRegEx @4D05810 status 10 <U_INVALID_CHAR_FOUND> \n--- \n\nAPAR: IV79204\nAbstract: LOGS RE-READ FROM THE BEGINNING WHEN DAYLIGHT SAVING\nTIME (DST) ENDS\nAdditional information: On Windows systems, when daylight saving\ntime ends, log files might be re-read from the beginning\nresulting in old events being re-sent. This only occurs \nwhen time is set back. \n\nThe agent falsely detects that the configuration (.conf) \nand format (.fmt) file have changed when the system is\nconfigured to \"Automatically adjust clock for Daylight \nSaving time\" and the file timestamps automatically change \ntriggering an agent reset. When NumEventsToCatchUp is set\nto -1, this series of events causes the log file to be\nre-read from the beginning. This was seen with IF0003 and\nIF0004 when monitoring log files on Windows operating \nsystems, but not with the Windows Event log. This problem\ndid not occur on UNIX systems. \n\nTo resolve this issue you must install and use the Windows\nWIX64 (x86-64 bit) agent or specify NumEventsToCatchUp=-2\nin the configuration file as a work-around. \n\nAPAR: IV77403\nAbstract: WINDOWS EVENT LOG EVENTS ARRIVED DELAYED WHEN \nNUMEVENTSTOCATCHUP IS USED \nAdditional information: With a large input load (for example,\n8004 events on each of 4 threads), Windows Event Log events\narrive with a significant delay when NumEventsToCatchUp=-1\nis set in the conf file. The delay increases as the event\nbacklog grows. It can be in the order of 5 minutes depending\non CPU, etc. This is a result of the inherent overhead in\nmaintaing the position (bookmark) in the Windows Event Log\nwhen NumEventsToCatchUp is set to -1 or n. \n\nThis is a follow-on to APAR IV63704. \n\nAPAR: IV76731\nAbstract: UNABLE TO RENAME FILE WHICH IS BEING MONITORED BY ITM\nLOG FILE AGENT \nAdditional information: On Windows systems, when the agent is\nmonitoring an application log, the log file cannot be \nrenamed because the file is open or in use. When new\nrecords are added to the log, the agent opens the log, \nreads the log and closes the log. However, when a large\nvolume of events are written to the log file, the log file\nmay remain open or in use due to operating system\nefficiencies. As a result, an attempt to rename the log \nfile may fail. This problem occurs more prevently with the\nWINNT 32-bit agent, when NumEventsToCatchUp is set to -1.\n\nTo minimize occurrence of this issue, use the Windows (WIX64) \nx86-64 bit Log File agent. \n\nAPAR: IV60331\nAbstract: RESETTING OF MULTIPLE CONF/FORMAT FILES CAUSES A CRASH\nAdditional information: Updating multiple configuration (.conf) \nor format (.fmt) files, usually via a script or a situation \nthat runs frequently, and causes the agent to reset might \nresult in a core or crash. This also might be more likely \nto occur with multiple subnodes to monitor a large number\nof files, for example, 100 files.

The backslash character (0x5c) is translated to\nUTF-8 0xC2A5, and when it is translated back to the native\ncode page, it is incorrectly translated to 0x1A which may\nshow as a blank space or unprintable character. As a result\nof IV68698, code page 932 is used to translate the event to\nUTF-8, however code page 943 is still being used to translate\nthe event from UTF-8 back to the native code page Shift-JIS.\n\nExample: \nLog File Agent v6.3 GA <cache file> \n70203_Base;msg='Tivoli [message]\\[message]' \n\nLog File Agent v6.3 and 6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-IF0004\n<cache file> \n70203_Base;msg='Tivoli [message] [message]' \n\nAPAR: IV75336\nAbstract: LFA ASSOCIATED WITH LOG ANALYSIS IS DROPPING EVENTS\nAdditional information: The agent when associated with Log\nAnalysis is dropping events.

Close examination of the agent log with\ntracing enabled, shows that parts of the events or lines are\noverwritten. \n\nThis only occurs when translating the data from a multi-byte \ncode page to UTF-8 and the conversion fails. The conversion \nfails because the agent was unable to read all the bytes \nrequired for a complete character into its buffer. This might \noccur if a group of messages are sent or when a message \nexceeds the maximum event size (EventMaxSize). Increasing the\nEventMaxSize might produce different results. \n\nThe problem exists on the following Log File Agent versions: \n- 6.3.0 interim fix 0003 and earlier \n- 6.2.3.2 and later \n- 6.2.2.4 Interim Fix 07 and later. \nIt is platform independent. \n\nProblem Determination: With the following trace enabled for\nthe LO agent: \nKBB_RAS1= ERROR (UNIT:logmonitor all)(UNIT:kum0nget all) \n(UNIT:kumprmfr all) \nthe agent log \n<hostname>_lo_[instance]_kloagent_<timestamp>-<nn>.log might \ncontain these error indicators: \n\"partial data\", \"RESIDUAL\" , or \"*****Error: u_strFromUTF8 \nfailed for string\". \n\nTrace entries are similar to the following where the \ntranslation buffer ends 0x1A and contains partial data. \n- - -\n... \n...:kum0nget.c,411,\"TranslateStringToUTF8\") Entry \n...:kum0nget.c,417,\"TranslateStringToUTF8\") translateBuffer \nallocated 865 bytes at 43075E0 \n...:kum0nget.c,419,\"TranslateStringToUTF8\") Converting string\nbuffer from ibm-943_P15A-2003 to UTF-8 \n...:kum0nget.c,467,\"TranslateStringToUTF8\") Input buffer \n43E31C3 of length 288 when translated into 43075E0 of \nlength 293 has partial data \n...:kum0nget.c,469,\"TranslateStringToUTF8\") <0x43E31C3,0x120> \n+... 00000000 23232323 3C323031 342F3132 2F303120 \n. . . \n. . . \n+... 00000100 3C313431 37343039 35343939 36383E20 \n<1417409549968>. \n+... 00000110 3C424541 2D303030 3030303E 203CE383 \n<BEA-000000>.<.. \n+... 00000120 A1E38388 1A <--- \n..... !! \n\n<< Note: When the failure occurs, the last three bytes of the \ntranslated data are 0xEF 0xBF0 0xBD or the last byte is a 0x1A.>>\n\n...:kum0nget.c,479,\"TranslateStringToUTF8\") Buffersize \n865 bytes; Translated size 292; Copied 865 characters to \nreadBuffer 43E31C3 RESIDUAL 1 <---- \n!!!!!!!!!! \n... \n(...:kum0regx.c,286,\"KUM0_IsRegExPatternMatch\") \n*****Error:u_strFromUTF8 failed for string \n... \n- - -\n\nAPAR: IV67737\nAbstract: DUPLICATE EVENTS SENT BECAUSE LOG DETECTED AS SWITCHED OR \nRE-CREATED \nAdditional information: After applying Log File Agent v6.3 IF0003 \n(6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-IF0003) on AIX and Linux, with \nNumEventsToCatchUp=-1 set in the conf file, the monitored log \nis incorrectly detected as re-created or switched.

This is because the\nlatter or subsequent piece of the line is written to the same\nlocation in the internal read buffer and overwrites the\ninitial piece of the line. The resulting partial line does\nnot match the formats and is sent to the UnmatchLog, if one\nwas specified in the configuration file.

This occurs more prevalently on Windows systems because\nthe operating system notifies the agent when the file has\nchanged. When the first part of the line is written, the agent\nis notified but the partial line does not match any formats.\nWhen the second part of the line is written, the agent is\nnotified again but the remainder of the line does not match\nany formats.

Please refer to this matrix for the latest \ncertification information.\nPlease refer to the IBM Software Product Compatibility Reports (SPCR)\nfor the latest operating system certification information:\nhttp://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/prodguid/v1r0/clarity/index.html [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/prodguid/v1r0/clarity/index.html]\n\n3.1 Prerequisites for this fix\n--------------------------------\nThe prerequisite level for this fix is as follows:\n- IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Version 6.2.2: Fix Pack 02 or higher\n(6.2.2-TIV-ITM-FP0002)\n\nThis fix pack is a complete install image and as such, can be \ninstalled on a pristine system. This fix is also cumulative, and can \nbe installed on any fix level for this version, release, and mod \nlevel above the prerequisite. \n\nFor details, see the Troubleshooting Wiki:\nhttps://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/wikis/home?lang=en#/wiki/Tivoli%20Monitoring/page/Log%20File%20Agent [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/wikis/home?lang=en#/wiki/Tivoli%20Monitoring/page/Log%20File%20Agent]\n\n4.0 Image directory contents\n===================\nThis fix image contains the following files:\n\n- 6.30-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002.tar.gz\n- 6.30-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002.README\n\n5.0 Installation instructions \n==================\n\n5.1 Before installing the fix \n-------------------------------\n- The prerequisites listed under section 3.1 entitled 'Prerequisites\nfor this fix' must be installed before this fix can be installed.\n\n- For the purpose of this README, the symbol <CANDLEHOME> is the \nIBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory. The default value\nfor CANDLEHOME is '/opt/IBM/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'\non Windows systems.\n\n- Before installing this fix on UNIX systems, set the environment \nvariable CANDLEHOME to the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation\ndirectory.\n\nFor example: \n> CANDLEHOME=/opt/IBM/ITM\n> export CANDLEHOME \n\n- Because there is no uninstall utility for this fix, make sure to\nperform a backup of your environment before installing this fix.\n\n- NOTE: Before installing the LO x86-64 bit agent, you must\nun-install the WINNT 32-bit version of the agent and the 32/64 \nbit compatibility package.\n\n\n5.2 Local agent update\n--------------------------\nFor installation instructions, see the Log File Agent User's Guide\nv6.3.0: \nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTFXA_6.3.0/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3/logfile/logfileagent_user.htm?lang=en [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTFXA_6.3.0/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3/logfile/logfileagent_user.htm?lang=en]\n\nNote: \n1. The PowerPC little-endian installation image is located in the\nPPC_LE directory of the installation image. Invoke ./install.sh\nfrom this directory.\n\n2. On Windows systems, when the installation completes, the \nReadme.txt displays \"Welcome to IBM Tivoli Monitoring V6.2.3 Fix\nPack 5.\" This is the installer level and Readme and is not an \nerror.\n\n5.3 Remote agent update\n----------------------------\n1. Transfer the archive file 6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002.tar.gz to a\ntemporary directory on the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring \nServer system. For the purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP>\nrepresents the fully qualified path to this directory. Note: On\nWindows systems, this path includes the drive letter.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems or\nan extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a directory\nstructure that contains fixes for all of the supported platforms.\n\n3. To add the agent fix bundles into the remote deploy depot, use\nthe \"tacmd addBundles\" command found in $CANDLEHOME/bin on UNIX\nsystems or in %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin on Windows systems. For more\ninformation on the \"tacmd addBundles\" command, see the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring Administrator's Guide.\n\nNote: \n1. The prerequisite Log File Agent bundles must also be in the\ndepot, to ensure successful completion of the remote agent update.\n2. The 6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP000<n> bundles must be removed from the\ndepot, using the \"tacmd removeBundles\" command. \nFor example: tacmd removeBundles -t lo -v 06300000<n>\n\nOn UNIX systems, \nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>/6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002:\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -n \n-i <TEMP>/6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002 \n\nOn Windows systems, \nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\\6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -n \n-i <TEMP>\\6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0002 \n\nwhere:\n-n indicates that prerequisite bundles are not automatically\nadded. The -n parameter must be used because the fix \ndirectory does not contain any prerequisites that the fix\nmight require. Please see Section 3.1 for the prerequisites\nfor this fix.\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be\nadded to the depot. \n\n4. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server, and deploy\nthe fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use\nthe following \"tacmd\" commands. For more information on the \n\"tacmd login\" and \"tacmd updateAgent\" commands, see the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring Administrator's Guide.\n\nOn UNIX systems: \n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd updateAgent -t lo \n-n <Managed system name>\n-v 06300200\n\nOn Windows systems:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd updateAgent -t LO \n-n <Managed system name> \n-v 06300200\n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is\nspecified as two characters (LO), not three characters (KLO).\n- The node (-n) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is the managed\nsystem name of the operating system (OS) agent to be updated.\nThe target node for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is always\nan OS agent.\n\n5.2 Agent support update\n------------------------------\nFix pack 6.3.0-TIV-ITM_LFA-FP0001 included new certificates \nin the agent support files which need to be installed. If you have\nalready installed these updates, there are no additional installation \nsteps. Otherwise, install the updates to the Tivoli Enterprise\nMonitoring Server, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or Tivoli\nEnterprise Portal Desktop. For more information about installing \napplication support, see Installing and enabling application support\nin the IBM Tivoli Monitoring Installation and Setup Guide.\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n========================\n\n6.1 Installation instructions for agent baroc file\n-----------------------------------------------------\nThere are no updates to the baroc files included in this fix or any\nof the superseded fixes. No additional installation steps are\nrequired.\n\n6.2 Verifying the update\n----------------------------\n1. To verify the agent was updated correctly, use the \"tacmd\" command\nto view the agent's current version after the agent is restarted.\nYou are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer prior to viewing the agent version. \n\nFor example:\nOn UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring\ninstallation directory, the default location is '/opt/IBM/ITM'. \n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t LO\n\nOn Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'. \n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t LO \n\nNote: The component (-t) for the \"tacmd listSystems\" command is\nspecified as two characters (LO), not three characters (KLO).\n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is: \n06.30.02.00.\n\nAfter the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify\nthe agent was successfully updated.\n\nFor the agent on Windows systems, the version number is \n06.30.02.00. \n\n2. To verify the agent you are running contains the updates from the\nfix, see the following lines in the agent log \n<hostname>_lo_<instance>_kloagent_<timestamp>.log located in\n$CANDLEHOME/logs on UNIX systems and\n%CANDLE_HOME%\\tmaitm6\\logs on Windows systems:\n\n<timestamp> Component: ira\n<timestamp> Driver: agent_fac_63:201709131450/4769716.3 \n<timestamp> Timestamp: Sep 13 2017 ...\n\n\n7.0 Known problems and workarounds\n=========================\nNone.\n\n\n8.0 Additional product information\n======================\nNone.\n\n\n9.0 Copyright and trademark information\n================================== \nA current list of IBM trademarks is available on the Web at \"Copyright\nand trademark information\" at www.ibm.com/legal/copytrade.shtml [www.ibm.com/legal/copytrade.shtml].\n\n\n10.0 Notices\n=======\nINTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION PROVIDES THIS PUBLICATION\n\"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,\nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nNON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\nSome jurisdictions do not allow disclaimer of express or implied\nwarranties in certain transactions, therefore, this statement may not\napply to you.\n\nThis information could include technical inaccuracies or typographical\nerrors.

Thanks. ", "document": {"content": " TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n How to resolve \"Transaction timed out after 601 seconds\" error while performing certain operations in Rule Team Server (RTS)/Decision Center (DC)? \n\nSYMPTOM\nWhile generating ruleapps in RTS/DC, the following error is thrown after a few minutes (typically 5 or 10 minutes): \n\nOn WebLogic: \n\nRule Team Server has encountered an unexpected error. The internal error message is: #{SelectionBean.asynchAction}: javax.faces.el.EvaluationException: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.sql.SQLException: The transaction is no longer active - status: 'Marked rollback. [Reason=weblogic.transaction.internal.TimedOutException: Transaction timed out after 601 seconds BEA1-5057DF8C316E1C1224CD]'. No further JDBC access is allowed within this transaction. \n\n... \n\n \n\nOn WebSphere: \nTimeoutManage I WTRN0006W: Transaction XXX has timed out after 300 seconds.\nTimeoutManage I WTRN0124I: When the timeout occurred the thread with which the transaction is, or was most recently, associated was Thread[WebContainer : 3,5,main].

If a transactional operation performed by RTS/DC takes longer than these timeouts to complete, the transaction is rolled back and the operation is not completed.\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nIf you perform time consuming operations in large repositories, you can increase the timeout value in the web.xml file of the RTS/DC EAR file (jrules-teamserver-<appserver>.ear\\teamserver.war\\WEB-INF) by changing the value of the property ilog.rules.teamserver.transaction.timeout. \n\n\nYou will find the property in the file web.xml defined as below:\n...\n<context-param>\n<description>Modify the timeout value that is associated with transactions (in seconds)</description>\n<param-name>ilog.rules.teamserver.transaction.timeout</param-name>\n<param-value>600</param-value>\n</context-param> \n... \n\nAnother place to look for are application server specific transaction timeout configurations. For example, for WebSphere Application Server, check the \"Maximum transaction timeout\" and increase it as needed as described here [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tjta_settlog.html].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration IBM Operational Decision Manager Platform Independent 7.5 Enterprise Business Integration IBM Operational Decision Manager Platform Independent 8.0.1, 8.0 Enterprise", "content_type": "text", "id": "swg21451229"}, "is_correct_answer": true, "is_correct_document": true, "origin": "gold-label", "answer": {"answer": "If you perform time consuming operations in large repositories, you can increase the timeout value in the web.xml file of the RTS/DC EAR file (jrules-teamserver-<appserver>.ear\\teamserver.war\\WEB-INF) by changing the value of the property ilog.rules.teamserver.transaction.timeout."}, "no_answer": false}, {"query": "After upgrading my datapower firmware to v6.0 or above, ssl handshake is failing, is there a reason for it?

The Crypto profiles now have TLSv1.2 and 1.1 which will be enabled by default. This affects the protocol version included in the Client Hello when DataPower is acting as the SSL client. If TLSv1.2 is not supported, the server still negotiates to the most secure supported protocol (e.g. TLSv1.1, TLSv1.0, SSLv3) if enabled. \n\nSome legacy servers with non-compliant implementations of SSL may reject connection attempts when TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.1 are used. In these cases, the handshake fails without properly negotiating to a mutually agreeable protocol.\n\nThe TLS versions 1.1 and 1.2 are part of the requirements for being compliant with NIST SP800-131a.\n\n\n\nANSWER\nUpgrade the SSL server to a version compliant with the SSL/TLS specifications. If required you may disable TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.1 within the Crypto Profile to allow compatibility. \n\n\nWithin the domain simply navigate to the Objects> Crypto Configuration> Crypto Profile>\nThen simply click on your specific profile to view the Options selection and see what SSL protocol versions are supported.\n\nAny further questions or issues please feel free to contact DataPower support.

After deploying an updated to the ruleapp, using \"Replace RuleApp Version\" versioning policy, the that the decision service is still executing the previous version of the business rules.\n", "document": {"content": " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n Why is Rule Execution Server (RES) not executing the expected version of a ruleset ?\nWhat are the possible causes after a hot deployment for Rule Execution Server not to use the updated ruleset ? \n\nCAUSE\nPossible causes for unexpected versions to be executed are: \n- the RES client requesting execution may be passing a wrong ruleset path\n- a hot deploy notification was not sent by the RES console, or not received by all the Execution Units (XU)\n- the ruleset parsing policy may be delaying the use of a ruleset version until its parsing is complete\n- the updated ruleset cannot be parsed successfully and RES falls back on an earlier active version that parses\n\n\nANSWER\nFirst validate that the RES components (the Execution Unit, the Management Console and the Client Application bundling the RES client library, which may be HTDS, MTDS, the SSP or a custom application) have been installed properly as per the documentation, see Configuring Rule Execution Server [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.config/config_ds_res/tpc_res_config.html]. \n\nThe ruleset version that is executed depends first on the ruleset path that is requested. Specifying a ruleset path with no version ( such as /MyRuleApp/MyRuleset/ ) is interpreted as a request to execute the highest version of the ruleset, as opposed to a version specific ruleset path ( such as /MyRuleApp/2.0/MyRuleset/1.0 ). Validate that the executed ruleset path is indeed unexpected considering the requested ruleset path. \n\n \n\nA common situation for an unexpected ruleset version to be executed is that of a hot deployment that is not successfully completed. The more frequent causes for the hot deployment not to happen as expected are: \n\n * Permission issue: the user publishing the ruleset update must have sufficient administrative rights ( Monitor role in WebSphere Application Server ) in order for the deployment to notify all the Execution Units of the ruleset update through JMX. For example on WebSphere Application Server see Mapping the resAdministrators group to the Monitor role [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.config/config_ds_res_was8/tsk_was_map_admin_group.html] \n * Version mismatch between the Execution Unit(s) and the Management Console: in order for the Management Console to detect the presence of execution units the versions of these components must match down to the fix level. For example 7.1.1.4 Management Console would not interact properly with a 7.1.1.3 Execution Unit. The version of the RES console is displayed in the \"About\" link (top right corner). The version of the Execution Unit can be seen in the resource adapter ra.xml file where a resourceadapter-version tag shows the version. For example with the WebSphere Application Server this can seen through: Resources > Resource adapters > XU > Deployment Descriptor \n * Asynchronous ruleset parsing is used : in this mode, while an updated ruleset is being parsed, an earlier version of the ruleset can be used for executions that are requested at that time. Note that there is no guarantee of which specific earlier version of the ruleset may be used since it is a factor of which versions are available in the deprecated ruleset cache and whether garbage collection has occurred. In order to remove any uncertainty on the version that can be executed, it is possible to either turn off the asynchronous mode [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing/topics/tsk_res_config_asynchron_turnoff.html], or force synchronous parsing in asynchronous mode [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing/topics/tsk_res_config_forcing_sync_pars.html]. \n * Notification scope is limited to one cell : by design the RES notification mechanism only works within one WebSphere Application Server Cell ( or one JBoss domain, or one Weblogic domain ), so a Management Console may only notify Execution Units that are running on servers in the same cell as the RES Console. See XU notification in a cluster over multiple cells [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21458245]. If you need to implement notifications to several cells at once, the document Ruleset updates and programmatic notification of RES eXecution Unit [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21418646] can be useful. \n * Parsing failure of an updated ruleset : leading the XU to fall back on an earlier active version that parses successfully \n * Ruleset update was only written to persistence: writing directly to RES persistence with the ant tasks res-write-db or res-write-file [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing/topics/tsk_res_deploy_rlapp_ant.html] does not trigger a notification, so the update may only been seen after server restart. \n * XU MBean is not activated in Java SE mode : See Activating the XU MBean in Java SE [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing/topics/tsk_res_config_xu_mbean_jse.html] \n * Multiple Java SE Execution Units are deployed in the same JVM: See Rule Execution Server J2SE mode hot deployment does not seem to work [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21585251] \n\n \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration WebSphere ILOG JRules Modules:Execution Server (BRES / RES) Platform Independent 7.1.1, 7.1, 7.0.3, 7.0.2, 7.0.1, 7.0", "content_type": "text", "id": "swg21598779"}, "is_correct_answer": true, "is_correct_document": true, "origin": "gold-label", "answer": {"answer": "Possible causes for unexpected versions to be executed are: \n- the RES client requesting execution may be passing a wrong ruleset path\n- a hot deploy notification was not sent by the RES console, or not received by all the Execution Units (XU)\n- the ruleset parsing policy may be delaying the use of a ruleset version until its parsing is complete\n- the updated ruleset cannot be parsed successfully and RES falls back on an earlier active version that parses"}, "no_answer": false}, {"query": "Is there a way in IBM Integration Bus (IIB) or WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) to not use cache inside a HttpRequest node?

Locate the errors.  * Global Cache interactions are logged in the Global Cache Activity Log [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_9.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bj23784_.htm].\n     * Informational messages and unhandled exceptions are written to the IIB Syslog [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKM8N_8.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/an04230_.htm]. This will also contain a number of BIP71** messages relating to startup/connection of cache components, and whether any of them have failed.\n     * Some messages may be written to the 'stderr' and 'stdout' files [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKM8N_8.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/au14165_.htm], located under the Broker's (Integration Node's) workpath.\n    \n    \n 4. \n 5. Check for known issues and solutions.  * General information regarding the Global Cache [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_9.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bc23789_.htm] is available in the product documentation, as well as instructions on how to configure the cache [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_9.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bn23780_.htm] via the provided tooling.\n     * Review how to access the Global Cache from a JavaCompute node [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMKHH_9.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bc23770_.htm].\n     * The IIB development and support teams regularly update the IIB DeveloperWorks Blog with Global Cache solutions [https://developer.ibm.com/integration/blog/].\n     * Your problem may have been discussed on the IIB dWAnswers forum [https://developer.ibm.com/answers/?community=iib].\n     * \n     * \n     * WebSphere Message Broker support site\n    \n    \n\n\n\nSTEP 2: COLLECT DATA\n\n 1.  mqsidc\n     See: mqsidc usage instructions [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKM8N_8.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bu46012_.htm]\n      * When running the tool, select the option for 'Broker Collector', when prompted.\n     \n     \n 2.  \n 3.  \n 4.

Traces\n     If the problem occurs during a runtime test or with the Toolkit test facility,\n     an Execution Group service level trace [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=849&uid=swg21177321#2] can be used to gain a better understanding of the problem.\n     \n     Note: For issues with Global Cache, broker service trace contains WXS trace. However, you may sometimes be advised to set a specific WXS trace string. Moreover, for startup issues, a WXS trace string must be specified, as well as enabling service trace.  * For startup issues, run this command prior to tracing:\n        mqsichangeproperties <broker> -e <EG> -o ComIbmCacheManager -n overrideTraceSpec -v ObjectGrid*=fine=enabled\n      * To capture all information (very verbose), run this command prior to tracing:\n        mqsichangeproperties <broker> -e <EG> -o ComIbmCacheManager -n overrideTraceSpec -v ObjectGrid*=all=enabled\n     \n     \n 8.  \n 9.  \n 10.

Similar to other \nupgrade software, the fix pack image also can be locally installed on a \ncomputer where the product software is not already installed.\n* You can populate agents to the depot.\n* You can remotely deploy agents to existing or new installations.\n\nWhen this fix pack image is downloaded from Passport Advantage, these rules \napply:\n* You can locally install the fix pack on a system that already hosts a \nlicensed copy of IBM Tivoli Monitoring for Databases.\n* You can locally install the fix pack on a system that does not already host \na licensed copy of IBM Tivoli Monitoring for Databases.\n* You can populate agents to the depot.\n* You can remotely deploy agents to existing or new installations.\n\n\n5.1 Before installing the fix\n-----------------------------\n- The prerequisites listed under section 3.1 entitled 'Upgrade prerequisites \nfor this fix' must be installed when for upgrade.\n\n- For the purpose of this README, the symbol <CANDLEHOME> is the \nIBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory. The default value\nfor CANDLEHOME is '/opt/IBM/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\\ibm\\itm'\non Windows systems.\n\n- If you have customized the Monitoring Agent for Sybase Agent \noy.ini file on UNIX system, this file should be backed up before the fix \ninstall. After this fix is installed, edit the latest oy.ini file and merge \nyour modifications into this oy.ini file.\n\n\n5.2 Local agent install and update (including silent installation)\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file (CNN25ML.tar.gz or .iso) to a temporary \ndirectory on the system that contains the agent code to be updated. \nFor the purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP> represents the fully \nqualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows, this includes the drive letter. \n\n2. Expand the archive file using the tar command on UNIX systems or \nan unzip utility on Windows systems. This creates a directory \nstructure that contains fixes for all of the supported platforms.\n\n3. Use the procedures in the \"ITCAM for Applications, Version 7.2.1.2 \nInstallation and Setup Guide\" to install the agent.\n\n4. Use the procedures in the specific database monitoring agent user's\nguide to complete the installation and configuration.\n\n5. After agent upgrade bitness of agent binary should be same as pre-upgrade on x86-64 \nbit windows. Agent do not support upgrade to 64 bit binary.\n\n\n5.3 Remote agent update and installation\n----------------------------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file (CNN25ML.tar.gz or .iso) to \na temporary directory on the IBM Tivoli Enterprise \nMonitoring Server system. For the purpose of this README, the \nsymbol <TEMP> represents the fully qualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows, this includes the drive letter. \n\n2. Expand the archive file using the tar command on UNIX systems or an \nunzip utility on Windows systems. This creates a directory structure\nthat contains fixes for all of the supported operating systems.\n\n3. To add the fix pack bundles into the remote deploy depot, use the\ntacmd addBundles command found in $CANDLEHOME/bin on UNIX systems\nor in %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin on Windows systems. For more information\non the tacmd addBundles command, see Appendix A. Commands reference\nof the \"IBM Tivoli Monitoring Administrator's Guide.\"\n\nOn a UNIX system: if the fix was expanded to \n<TEMP>/CNN25ML:\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>/CNN25ML/WINDOWS/Deploy -t oy -f\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>/CNN25ML/unix -t oy -f \n\nwhere:\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be\nadded to the depot.\n-t is the product code of the product to add, in this case or \nrepresents the Monitoring Agent for Sybase Agent\n-f performs the actions without asking for confirmation\n\nOn a Windows system: if the fix was expanded to \n<TEMP>/CNN25ML:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>\\CNN25ML\\WINDOWS\\Deploy -t oy -f\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>\\CNN25ML\\unix -t oy -f \n\nwhere:\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be\nadded to the depot. \n-t is the product code of the product to add, in this case oy \nrepresents the Monitoring Agent for Sybase Agent\n-f performs the actions without asking for confirmation\n\n5. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server, and deploy\nthe fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use\nthe following tacmd commands. For more information on the\ntacmd login and updateAgent commands, see Appendix A. Commands\nreference of the \"IBM Tivoli Monitoring Administrator's Guide.\"\n\nOn a UNIX system: \n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the managed system name for the OS agent on the \nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\ntacmd updateAgent command. \n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd updateAgent -t oy \n-n <Managed system name>\n-v 062002000\n\nOn a Windows system:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%/bin/tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the managed system name for the OS agent on the \nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\ntacmd updateAgent command. \n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd updateAgent -t OY \n-n <Managed system name>\n-v 062002000\n\nIf there are not prior version koy agent on remote system .Then use \nbelow tacmd addSystem command.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addSystem -t OY \n-n <Managed system name> \n-p INSTANCE=\"<Sybase instance name>\"\n\nNote:\n- The <Sybase instance name> is the Sybase agent instance name to be monitored on \nremote system.\n- The component (-t) for the updateAgent command is specified as \ntwo characters (oy), not three characters (koy).\n- The node (-n) for the updateAgent command is the managed system\nname of the operating system (OS) agent to be updated. The \ntarget node for an updateAgent command is always an OS agent.\n-Remote installation will fail if the MTEMS window is open on the agent machine.\n\n5.4 Agent support update\n------------------------\nUse the following steps to update the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring \nServer, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nDesktop:\n\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file (CNN25ML.tar.gz or .iso) to \nthe IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Servers, IBM Tivoli\nEnterprise Portal Servers or Tivoli Enterprise Portal desktops. \n\n2. Expand the archive file using the tar command on UNIX systems or an \nunzip utility on Windows systems. \n\n3. Use the procedures in the \"ITCAM for Applications, Version 7.2.1.2\nInstallation and Setup Guide.\"\n\n4. Use the procedures in the specific database monitoring agent user's\nguide to complete the installation and configuration.\n\n5. If the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server being updated is remote (not a \nHub Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server) then restart the Tivoli Enterprise \nMonitoring Server.\n\n\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n=======================================\n6.1 Verifying the update\n-------------------------\n1.To verify whether the agent is updated correctly, use the tacmd command to\nview the current version of the agent after the agent is restarted. Ensure that\nyou log on to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server before you view the agent\nversion.\nFor example,\n\nOn UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation\ndirectory, the default location is /opt/IBM/ITM.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t OY\n\nOn Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring\ninstallation directory, the default location is C:\\IBM\\ITM.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t OY\n\nNote:\nThe component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is specified as two\ncharacters (OY), not three characters (KOY).\n\nWhen the agent is updated, the agent version is changed to 06.20.02.00.\nAfter the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify whether the\nagent was updated. For the agent on Windows systems, the version number is\n06.20.02.00.\n\n2.To verify whether the agent support files are updated correctly, use the\nkincinfo command on Windows systems or the cinfo command on Linux or UNIX\nsystems.\n\nOn UNIX or Linux systems:\nTo validate that all components have been installed, run the following command:\n$CANDLEHOME/bin/cinfo -i\n\nSample output for the cinfo command on a UNIX or Linux systems\n----------------------------------------------------------\n[root@HJS-SYB-1 bin]# ./cinfo\n\n*********** Wed Nov 29 23:53:13 IST 2017 ******************\nUser: root Groups: root\nHost name : HJS-SYB-1 Installer Lvl:06.30.06.00\nCandleHome: /opt/IBM0611/ITM\n***********************************************************\n\n-- CINFO Menu --\n1) Show products installed in this CandleHome\n2) Show which products are currently running\n3) Show configuration settings\n4) Exit CINFO\n1\n\n*********** Wed Nov 29 23:53:15 IST 2017 ******************\nUser: root Groups: root\nHost name : HJS-SYB-1 Installer Lvl:06.30.06.00\nCandleHome: /opt/IBM0611/ITM\n***********************************************************\n...Product inventory\n\nax IBM Tivoli Monitoring Shared Libraries\nlx8266 Version: 06.30.06.00\n\ngs IBM GSKit Security Interface\nlx8266 Version: 08.00.50.36\n\njr Tivoli Enterprise-supplied JRE\nlx8266 Version: 07.09.01.00\n\noy Monitoring Agent for Sybase server\nlx8266 Version: 06.20.02.00\n\nui Tivoli Enterprise Services User Interface\n\nOn Windows systems:\nTo validate that all components have been installed, run the following command:\n%CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\kincinfo \u2013i\n\nSample output of the kincinfo command on a Windows System\n----------------------------------------------------------\nC:\\IBM\\ITM\\BIN>kincinfo -i\n********** Thursday, November 30, 2017 10:10:02 AM **********\nUser : Administrator Group : NA\nHost Name : HJ-IBMIBM6737 Installer : Ver: 063006000\nCandleHome : C:\\IBM\\ITM\nInstallitm : C:\\IBM\\ITM\\InstallITM\n*************************************************************\n...Product Inventory\n\nIN Install INS/Windows Install Component\nWINNT Version: 06.30.06.00 Build: 201511302132\n\nIN TEMA(32-bit) INS/ITM 6.x Agent Install Component\nWINNT Version: 06.30.06.00 Build: 201511302132\n\nIN TEMA(64-bit) INS/ITM 6.x Agent Install Component Extensions\nWINNT Version: 06.30.06.00 Build: 201511302132\n\nAC KAC(64-bit) CMA/32/64 Bit Agent Compatibility Package\nWIX64 Version: 06.30.06.00 Build: 201511302132\n\nGL KGL(64-bit) CMA/Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Agent Framework\nWIX64 Version: 06.30.06.00 Build: d5334a\n\nGL KGL(32-bit) CMA/Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Agent Framework\nWINNT Version: 06.30.06.00 Build: d5334a\n\nGS KGS(64-bit) GSK/IBM GSKit Security Interface\nWIX64 Version: 08.00.50.36 Build: d5313a\n\nGS KGS(32-bit) GSK/IBM GSKit Security Interface\nWINNT Version: 08.00.50.36 Build: d5313a\n\nJM KJM(32-bit) JVM/Embedded JVM\nWINNT Version: 07.09.01.00 Build: 201506221629\n\nNT KNT(32-bit) CMA/Monitoring Agent for Windows OS\nWINNT Version: 06.30.00.00 Build: 30321\n\nOY KOY(32-bit) CMA/Monitoring Agent for Sybase Server\nWINNT Version: 06.20.02.00 Build: 72651\n\nUE KUE(32-bit) CMA/Tivoli Enterprise Services User Interface Extensions\nWINNT Version: 06.30.06.00 Build: d5334a\n\nUI KUI(32-bit) CLI/Tivoli Enterprise Services User Interface\nWINNT Version: 06.30.06.00 Build: 201511302132\n\n\n7.0 Known problems and workarounds\n==================================\nProblem: Sybase agent configuration is not working using itmcmd manage \ncommand from GUI on Solaris 11\nWorkaround:\nFor Solaris 11:\nRun './itmcmd config -A oy' present at location:<CandleHome>/bin\n\nProblem: Prereqchecker which is integrated with the installer fails on \nwindows platform.\nWorkaround: \nFor Windows:\nRun on command prompt \u2018prereq_checker.bat KOY\u2019 present at location:\nInstallerPath\\Sybase_Agent_Installer\\WINDOWS\\prereqchecker\n\nFor Unix:\nRun \u2018./prereq_checker.sh KOY\u2019 present at location:\nInstallerPath\\Sybase_Agent_Installer\\unix\\prereqchecker\n\nProblem: Registry entries are not cleared when agent is uninstalled on 64 bit\nwindows platform.\nWorkaround: Delete registry entries manually from path:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Candle\\KOY\\610\\\n\nProblem: When running the verification step in the \"itmcmd config -A oy\"\nfunction on a Solaris 10 system, the following output from the verification\nprogram is produced: \"user needs read authority to\".\nWorkaround: Issue \"ps -ef | grep koyagent\" to locate the koyagent process and\nissue \"kill -9\" for that process. Check the Navigator tree in the Tivoli\nEnterprise Portal for an offline koyagent entry and clear the offline entry.\nThe Monitoring Agent for Sybase Server that was configured by \"itmcmd config\" \nis unaffected by this problem. \n\nProblem: When running multiple remote deploys and agent upgrades, a task\ntimeout occurs during either the remote deployment or the agent upgrade. \nWorkaround: Restart the OS Agent following the task timeout and before\nperforming the next remote deployment or agent upgrade.\n\nProblem: If you are installing this fix into a depot on a Windows computer, and\nWinZip(R) is used to extract this fix, text files in the depot might contain\nCTRL-Ms. When this fix is remotely deployed to a UNIX machine from the Tivoli\nEnterprise Monitoring Server or depot on Windows, the installation fails. The\nCTRL-Ms are caused by extracting the fix using WinZip with \"TAR file smart\nCR/LF conversion\" option enabled. This extraction causes WinZip to put CTRL-Ms\nin text files when they are extracted on UNIX through remote deployment. \nWorkaround: If you are using WinZip for the fix installation for the Tivoli\nEnterprise Monitoring Server on Windows, disable the default \"TAR file smart\nCR/LF conversion\" option. \n\nProblem: In the Tivoli Enterprise Portal, the instance name is displayed\ninstead of the host name in the Navigation tree. \nFor example the Navigation tree might look like this,\nMySid\nSybase\nAlert Log\n...\ninstead of this,\nMyHost\nSybase - MySid\nAlert Log\n...\n\nThe problem is that the length of the managed node name, <SID>:<HOSTNAME>:SYB,\nexceeds the length supported by the portal. A possible cause is that the\nfully-qualified host name is being used. If 'uname -n' on the Monitoring Agent\nfor Sybase Server computer returns a fully-qualified host name, then this host\nname is the cause. \nWorkaround: Override the host name with an appropriate shorter name by adding\nthe following line to oy.config: \nexport COLL_HOSTNAME=<short name>\n\n\n8.0 Additional product information \n==================================\nSteps for enabling SDA (Self-describing agent)\nFor Windows:\n1.On the computer where the monitoring server is installed, in the Manage\nTivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services application, right-click the agent and \nselect Advanced\u2192 Edit ENV file.\n2.Edit the existing environment variable to: TEMA_SDA=Y.\n\nFor UNIX:\n1.On the computer where the monitoring agent is installed, change to the\n<Install_dir>/config/ directory.\n2.Open the coordinating file:\nFor single-instance agents: <pc>.ini \nFor multi-instance agents: <pc>_<instance>.ini file \nWhere pc is the two-character product code.\n3.Edit the existing environment variable to: TEMA_SDA=Y.\n\n\n9.0 Copyright and trademark information \n========================================\nIBM, the IBM logo, and ibm.com are trademarks or registered trademarks of\nInternational Business Machines Corp., registered in many jurisdictions\nworldwide.

The old PICTURE clause in DFHCOB was TMRCPUT-TIME PICTURE 9(8) COMP. The new PICTURE clause is S9(8). Looking at the SMF 110 records generated by CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS TS) V3.2 and higher, you find values like x'000000000025CFE0'. The values generated by CICS TS V2.3 and V3.1 are more in the range '00000071'. You want to know, what does the field USRCPUT represent and how to convert it to seconds? \n\nCAUSE\nThe length of USRCPUT changed starting in CICS TS V3.2. \n\nANSWER\nUSRCPUT is the total CPU time for user task including DB2 time. It is the processor time for which the user task was dispatched on each CICS TCB under which the task executed. This can include TCB modes QR, RO, CD, FO, SZ, RP, SL, SO, H8, J8, L8, S8 and D2.\n\nTo convert the OLD format (prior to CICS TS V3.2) of USRCPUT CPUTIME to milliseconds, you would: \n\n 1. Convert the 4-byte value from hex to decimal. \n 2. Multiply the result by 0.016 to obtain the value in milliseconds or by .000016 to get the value in seconds.\n\n\nNote that 16 microseconds is equivalent to 0.016 milliseconds and that its equivalent to 0.000016 seconds. A clock is a 32-bit value, expressed in units of 16 microseconds, accumulated during one or more measurement periods. The 32-bit value is followed by 8 reserved bits, that are in turn followed by a 24-bit value indicating the number of such periods. \n\nFor a specific example, if the total USRCPUT field had a value of X'000001BB000005' then the first 4 bytes would be the accumulative CPU time. So, for 5 dispatches of the task you had 1BB ticks. Converting 1BB to decimal gives you 443. You multiply that by .000016 to get .007088 total CPU seconds for the transaction. \n\nThe USRCPUT field for CICS TS V3.2 is a 12 byte field. Basically, clock fields like USRCPUT are now 12 bytes instead of 8 bytes. So, in CICS TS V2.3 the USRCPUT part of the SMF 110 record might look like 00000BC300000007 which you would break it down as follows: 00000BC300000007 Example 8 byte USRCPUT in releases of CICS prior to CICS TS V3.2 00000BC3 CPU time in binary units where the smallest unit is 16 microseconds (bytes 1 to 4) 00 Reserved bits (byte 5) 000007 Count of the number of times contributed to the CPU time (bytes 6 to 8) \nNow with CICS TS V3.2 you will see something like 000000000BC3F29D00000007 and you would break it down as follows: 000000000BC3F29D00000007 Example 12 byte USRCPUT in releases CICS TS V3.2 and higher 000000000BC3F29D CPU time in store clock (STCK) units (bytes 1 to 8) 00 Reserved bits (byte 9) 000007 Count of the number of times contributed to the CPU time (bytes 10 to 12) \nBefore you could convert the CPU time to seconds by taking 00000BC3 and converting to decimal and multiplying by .000016. But, now you would take the middle 4 bytes of the CPU time (which would give you 00000BC3) and then convert it like you used to. Or, to get a little greater accuracy you could do the following:  1. Disregard the bottom 3 nibbles of the CPU time (leaving you 000000000BC3F) and convert it to decimal. \n 2. Multiply the result by .000001 to get the value in seconds. \n    \n\n\nFor example, if using a value of 0000000000E6B140 for CPU time you would drop off the 140 which gives you 0000000000E6B. Then convert it to a decimal of 3691, and multiply 3691 by .000001 to get 0.003691 seconds. \n\nIf you take a look in DFH$MOLS which is found in SDFHSAMP, you can see how it does the conversion. When in the source, do a find on label FLDCLPRT. There you can see that with CICS TS V3.2 data, it will pass all 8 bytes of the time component to IPPARMS and pass that to the STCKCONV macro. But for data from releases of CICS before V3.2, the code will clear the 8-bytes in IPPARMS and then copy the 4 byte time component to the middle 4 bytes of that, and then pass that to STCKCONV. \n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n CICS/TS CICS TS CICS Transaction Server", "content_type": "text", "id": "swg21366634"}, "is_correct_answer": true, "is_correct_document": true, "origin": "gold-label", "answer": {"answer": ""}, "no_answer": true}, {"query": "We are running WAS 6.1.

If not, please elaborate more? 13:49 Can I manage my enterprise applications using flexible management (JobManager/AdminAgent)? 16:20 Is it possible to deploy any regular enterprise application to be a business level application (BLA) in WebSphere Application Server runtime? What are the benefits of business level applications? 19:50 My installedApps folder was wiped out. How do I recover it and how do I prevent this from happening in the future? 22:19 I am using \"com.ibm.websphere.management.cmdframework.AdminCommand\" to set up a command and execute it. The command executes (w/o any errors) and I can even get the output. However, the result is coming in as a single object as opposed to a collection of multiple objects. I have tried multiple ways to read the result but all return the same, a single object. Is there a way to split the object into multiple objects without doing multiple string manipulations? 25:14 Could you please describe how we can efficiently use property based configuration to install applications? In particular, is there a practical way to use this mechanism for the deployment of an application to multiple states using portable property files and variable mappings? Could you also talk about resource mappings that are defined as tasks in the deployment configuration? 31:19 How can I perform a roll out update with scripting? 32:44 Do we have any option to avoid the JVM restart in the \"roll update\" option? 34:14 I have a question on the topic of mBean in the InfoCenter. Where can I find more information on how to use them as well as best practices? 36:21 Apart from the JVM parameters (i.e. JVM heap size, log path) and other resources configurations (i.e. Datasource and QCF) changes, do we need to restart the JVM for any application deployment (i.e. update option) activity? If so, what are the different scenarios for the JVM restart requirement for any WAR or EAR file deployment? 38:14 I have exported an EAR file from one WAS V6.1 admin console and tried to deploy the exported EAR file into another WAS V6.1 admin console (different WAS profile with the same WAS version). All of a sudden, in the destination WAS V6.1 admin console all of the installed applications have disappeared from the $WAS_INSTALL_HOME/ profiles/AppSrv02/installedApps/ directory. How can I avoid this kind of situation in the future? 41:00 Can we have multiple application deployments for different applications deployed on different JVMs at the same time using roll out update? 43:09 Regarding the property based configuration question (7). Is the simple output format an option in the extract command? What version of WAS supports it? 44:24 With an application deployed in a cluster, is it possible to use wsadmin to stop only in one node of the cluster when the plugin does not know that the application is stopped on that node? Also is it possible to configure the plugin to be detected when the application is stopped? 47:24 If I have one application that is deployed in a cluster with two nodes. We can send all the transactions through one particular JVM without stopping the JVM or the server? 49:20 Does IBM have or provide any sample scripts to automate application deployments in a distributed environment? 50:54 Can we customize the error page for an application when the application is in a stopped state? 52:05 Closing remarks 53:53 End of Call \nPanel of Experts: Kumaran Ayyakutti WebSphere Application Server L2 support Preston Law WebSphere Application Server L2 support Sangwon Oh WebSphere Application Server L2 support Vikram Thommandru WebSphere Application Server L2 support \n\nPRESENTATION\n[http://www.ibm.com/i/v16/icons/weblecture.gif]WSTE-03132012-AskTheExperts-ApplicationManagementWebSphereApplicationServer-Thommandru.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27024145&aid=2]WSTE-03132012-AskTheExperts-ApplicationManagementWebSphereApplicationServer-Thommandru.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27024145&aid=1]\n\nGet Adobe Reader [http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html] to view PDF\n\nAUDIO\n[http://www.ibm.com/i/v16/icons/aud.gif]To replay the recording of this 53 minutes conference call, click on Download Audio [http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/websphere/techexchange/Mar-13-2012-Thommandru.mp3] (6.0MB - audio in MP3 format).

These services are listed below:  * Packet processing \n    * Packet Capture \n    * Local Management Interface (LMI) \n    * License and Update (LUM) \n    * SiteProtector Communication\n      \n   \n   \n * You can now view and search logs from the command line using the \"less\" and \"tail\" commands from within logs mode. Log files found using the less command are System, Webserver, Updates and Analysis logs. \n   \n * With the admin-sftp account you can now retrieve Snapshots, Packet Captures, and support files. This account uses the same password as the admin account. \n   Note: More details on admin-sftp can be found in the Downloading files with an SFTP client [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHLHV_5.3.1/com.ibm.alps.doc/tasks/alps_downloading_sftp.htm]documentation on the Knowledge Center. [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHLHV_5.3.1/com.ibm.alps.doc/tasks/alps_downloading_sftp.htm]\n\n\nResponse enhancement:  * Forwarded events (Remote Syslog Alert Responses) will show the same details as the content sent to SiteProtector. \n * Support for using the TCP protocol when creating Remote Syslog Alert Responses to prevent messages being truncated and improve delivery reliability over using UDP.\n\n\nNetwork Access Policy enhancement:  * You can now use the network access policy to control network access when the HTTP X-Forward-For (XFF) header is enabled. The network policy can use the XFF header along with the packet source to control network traffic.\n\n\nIPS Policy enhancements:  * You can now derive a new IPS object from an existing IPS object by right-clicking on an IPS object and left-clicking on Clone.\n   \n * When enabling network, transport-layer, and status events in a non-default IPS object, a warning message is shown. This will help to minimize what may be seen as a false negative.\n\n\nPerformance:  * Inspection throughput increase for XGS 7100 up to 25Gbps, FPL5 (25Gbps) added.\n\n\nMiscellaneous updates and implementation changes:  * Top 10 URLs and URL categories widget in the Local Management Interface have been disabled by default. Given the limited popularity of this feature, coupled with the performance impact in certain situations, we disabled the feature by default. You can re-enable it by using the advanced parameter tune.url.topten.tracking=true. \n   \n *  We have removed the MultiCast Domain Name System (mDNS), under some configurations it caused security risks within the appliance.\n   \n * Support for mutual certificate authentication for communication between the Network Security appliance and SiteProtector.\n\n\nKnown issues: \nYou can find a list of known issues for IBM Security Network Protection 5.3.1 in Technote 1715537: Known issues for IBM Security Network Protection version 5.3.1 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21715537]. \n\n\n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21902778&aid=1] [https://ibm.biz/BdHdZx] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21902778&aid=2] [http://ibm.biz/InfraSecForumTechnote] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21902778&aid=3] [http://ibm.biz/SecSuptUTube] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21902778&aid=4] [http://ibm.biz/InfraSecFixes] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21902778&aid=5] [http://ibm.biz/FlexLicLogin] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21902778&aid=6] [http://ibm.biz/MyNotification] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21902778&aid=7] [http://ibm.biz/ContactSecSupport] \nRELATED INFORMATION\n A Japanese translation is available [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21903740]", "content_type": "text", "id": "swg21902778"}, "is_correct_answer": true, "is_correct_document": true, "origin": "gold-label", "answer": {"answer": "You can now derive a new IPS object from an existing IPS object by right-clicking on an IPS object and left-clicking on Clone."}, "no_answer": false}, {"query": "\n\nWhen I click a test connection to a datasource, in the SystemOut.log file I can see the below information...\n\n     [8/11/16 5:31:28:494 EDT] 00000088 DSConfigurati I   DSRA8205I: JDBC driver name  : Oracle JDBC driver  \n     [8/11/16 5:31:28:495 EDT] 00000088 DSConfigurati I   DSRA8206I: JDBC driver version  : 9.2.0.1.0  \n     [8/11/16 5:31:28:496 EDT] 00000088 DSConfigurati I   DSRA8025I: Successfully connected to DataSource.  \n     [8/11/16 5:31:28:608 EDT] 00000088 DSConfigurati I   DSRA8203I: Database product name : Oracle  \n     [8/11/16 5:31:28:608 EDT] 00000088 DSConfigurati I   DSRA8204I: Database product version : Oracle Database 12c Enterprise Edition Release 12.1.0.2.0 - 64bit Production With the Partitioning, Automatic Storage Management, OLAP, Advanced Analytics\n\nWhere is WAS getting this information from?\n\nWe are using WAS ND v8.5.5.0. We are running Oracle Database 12c Enterprise Edition Release 12.1.0.2.0 - 64bit Production. The JDBC driver is ojdbc6.jar - Oracle 11.1.0.7.0-Production JDBC 4.0 compiled with JDK6.\n\nThere is another older driver ojdbc14.jar\n\nWhen I do a test connection, I can see the JDBC Driver version is 9.2.0.1.0, but in the JDBC providers I have specified ojdbc6.jar. so it should show 11.1.0.7.0 but it is showing 9.2.0.1.0. why it is showing 9.2.0.1.0?\n\nIf we keep only ojdbc6.jar and do a test connection it is giving the correct JDBC Drivers version as it is same with ojdbc6.jar. But when we keep both ojdbc6.jar and ojdbc14.jar it is not giving the correct JDBC Driver version looks it is giving ojdbc14.jar version.\n\nJDBC providers are pointed to ojdbc6.jar, but why it is showing a different JDBC driver version?", "document": {"content": "isolate this resource provider TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n Customer has defined 3 Oracle JDBC Providers at cell, node and server\nscope.

This needs to be configured on each JDBC Provider. You cannot isolate only one resource provider, all the provider configurations in different scopes will have to be configured with the \"Isolate this resource provider\" setting. In this scenario, the resource provider classes from different versions of the jars are not imported or accessed to verify if the isolation has indeed worked. In order to use the server-scoped resource provider the datasource using the server-scoped jdbc provider will have to be referenced from the application after isolating the resource providers and using a resource reference in the application. \n\n\nGo to the JDBC Provider and enable \"isolate the resource provider\". When \"Isolate this resource provider\" is enabled, it ensures that only the jar that was specified in the classpath will be used for all the datasources under that particular JDBC provider. \n\n \n\nHere are links to Knowledge Center articles which contain further information on the setting: \n\n\nJDBC provider settings [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/udat_manjdbcprodet.html]\n\nConsiderations for isolated resource providers [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/rdat_isolatedlimitations.html]", "content_type": "text", "id": "swg21634612"}, "is_correct_answer": true, "is_correct_document": true, "origin": "gold-label", "answer": {"answer": "When multiple versions of the JDBC driver are configured in WebSphere Application Server, irrespective of the scopes, there is a possibility of a collision of the classes and we cannot predict from which version of the driver jar the class got loaded."}, "no_answer": false}, {"query": "I need to understand details regarding Security Bulletin: IBM MQ Clients connecting to an MQ Queue Manager can cause a SIGSEGV in the AMQRMPPA channel process terminating it (CVE-2018-1371).

If the users need to base their data source on one of the above options, they will be able to do so by using a manual procedure via the Administrative Console. The automatic configuration process for Common Event Infrastructure should support these cases as well. \n\n \n\nLOCAL FIX: \n\nNone \n\n \n\nRECOMMENDATION: \n\nNone \n\n \n\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION: \n\nThe automatic configuration process with Informix database has been changed by adding to the configEventServiceInformixDB configuration Admin Task a new optional parameter -jdbcDriverVersion that will accept the following possible/acceptable values jta / 3.0 / 4.0. By using the \u2018jta\u2019 value it will configure the JDBC provider to use Informix JDBC Driver for JTA/XA. The usage of \u20183.0\u2019 value will determine the configuration of the JDBC provider to be based on the Informix Using IBM DB2 JDBC Universal Driver (XA) version whereas using the 4.0 value will produce the JDBC provider based on the Informix Using IBM JCC Driver (XA) version. \n\nThe introduced behavior is: \n\n 1. -jdbcDriverVersion not specified in the AdminTask - The configuration will be performed using 'Informix JDBC Driver (XA)', therefore Informix JDBC Driver for JTA/XA driver version. \n 2. -jdbcDriverVersion specified but no value supplied - Will raise an exception as -jdbcDriverVersion needs a parameter, then if the user goes so far as to use the parameter but does NOT supply a value, we give an error stating like in the following example \"CEIIN0739E No value was specified for the jdbcDriverVersion parameter\". \n 3. -jdbcDriverVersion specified with the 'jta' value supplied - The configuration will be performed using 'Informix JDBC Driver for JTA/XA'. \n 4. -jdbcDriverVersion specified with the '3.0' value supplied - The configuration will be performed using 'Informix Using IBM DB2 JDBC Universal Driver'. \n 5. -jdbcDriverVersion specified with the '4.0' value supplied - The configuration will be performed using 'Informix Using IBM JCC Driver (XA)', therefore based on the provider that supports JDBC 4.0 specification using the IBM Data Server Driver for JDBC and SQLJ version. \n 6. -jdbcDriverVersion specified with a value OTHER than jta, 3.0 or 4.0 - Will raise an exception like in the following example: \"CEIIN0701E The parameter jdbcDriverVersion contains the value <wrong_value>, which is not valid. Valid values are: jta, 3.0, 4.0.\". \n    \n    \n    The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in fix pack 7.0.0.9.

Eclipse changed the window system requirement from motif to gtk on UNIX operating systems. For AIX, this Eclipse window system change requires the gtk libraries to be installed to support the GUI. For Installation Manager, the GUI is the wizard mode of operation. \n\nYou can use Installation Manager without the gtk libraries. For information on console mode, command-line mode, or silent mode; see the Installation Manager Information Center [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1r6/topic/com.ibm.cic.agent.ui.doc/topics/c_modes.html]. Silent mode uses a response file and command-line mode is supported by all packages. For console mode, check your product documentation to verify that the product supports console mode.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nTo use the GUI, the gtk+ RPM and dependencies must be available on AIX. \n\n\nInstall this set of RPMs on AIX:\n\n\natk-1.12.3-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\ncairo-1.8.8-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nexpat-2.0.1-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nfontconfig-2.4.2-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nfreetype2-2.3.9-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\ngettext-0.10.40-6.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\nglib2-2.12.4-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\ngtk2-2.10.6-4.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nlibjpeg-6b-6.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\nlibpng-1.2.32-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nlibtiff-3.8.2-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\npango-1.14.5-4.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\npixman-0.12.0-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nxcursor-1.1.7-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nxft-2.1.6-5.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\nxrender-0.9.1-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nzlib-1.2.3-3.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\n\nThe installed RPMs must be of the minimum versions listed above.\n\nTo install the RPM versions specified above take the following steps: \n\n\n 1. Download the gtk2_bundle_v2.tar package [ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/aix/freeSoftware/aixtoolbox/ezinstall/ppc/] (version 'v2') containing all the RPMs and the install script to a new directory. \n    \n    \n 2. Decompress the tar file. \n    You can use the command tar -xvf gtk2_bundle_<version>.tar to decompress the file.\n    \n    \n 3. Open the decompressed directory gtk2_bundle_<version> and run the install.sh script.\n    \n    The script will check if the required RPMs are installed at the compatible level. If they are not, the script will prompt to install the compatible versions.\n    \n    \n 4. Verify the environment variable LIBPATH contains a path to the installed libraries. \n    For example LIBPATH=/opt/freeware/lib/\n\n\nNote that if you download and install RPMs individually, we have found that the following libraries are incompatible:  * glib2-2.14.6-2 and gtk2-2.10.6-5 \n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n#Unreadable characters in the GUI when using X11 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21661861]", "content_type": "text", "id": "swg21631478"}, "is_correct_answer": true, "is_correct_document": true, "origin": "gold-label", "answer": {"answer": "To use the GUI, the gtk+ RPM and dependencies must be available on AIX. \n\n\nInstall this set of RPMs on AIX:"}, "no_answer": false}, {"query": "I need to understand details regarding \"Action required for SOA Policy Gateway Pattern For Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server for the GNU C library (glibc) vulnerability (CVE-2015-0235)\".

By sending a specially crafted, but valid hostname argument, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the targeted process or cause the process to crash. The impact of an attack depends on the implementation details of the targeted application or operating system. This issue is being referred to as the \"Ghost\" vulnerability.\n\n\nCVSS Base Score: 7.6CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/100386 [http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/100386]for the current scoreCVSS Environmental Score*: UndefinedCVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)\n\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS\nReal-time Compression Appliance R3.8\nReal-time Compression Appliance R3.9\nReal-time Compression Appliance R4.1\n\nREMEDIATION/FIXES\nReal-time Compression R3.8.0.09\nReal-time Compression R3.9.1.10\nReal-time Compression R4.1.2.08 \n\nOnce updates have been applied, any process using glibc will need to be restarted.

However, the data was shown\ncorrectly as \u2018Not Collected\u2019 on the portal.\n\nAPAR: IJ05451 \nAbstract: ITCAM SQL Server Agent's collector process crashes when using\nSQL Server Native Client 10.0 or SQL Server Native Client 11.0 as\nODBC driver.\nAdditional Information: Collector was not able to handle all possible values\nreturned by ODBC when using SQL Server Native Client 10.0 and SQL Server\nNative Client 11.0 causing it to crash.\n\n2.2 DEFECTS:\n-----------------\nDEFECT: 170986\nAbstract: Memory leak in Table Detail attribute group. \nAdditional Information: Memory leak observed in Table Detail attribute\ngroup because incorrect de-allocation handling. \n\nDEFECT: 170987\nAbstract: Crash observed in Availability group details attribute group\nand Table detail attribute group\nAdditional Information: Crash observed in Availability group details\nattribute group and in Table detail attribute group for the wrong\nusage of iterator after erase. Issue happened because an attempt to\nincrement the iterator was made after the iterator was deleted through\nerase function. \n\nDEFECT: 170993\nAbstract: intial size > max size gives incorrect values\nAdditional Information: If a database was created with restricted growth\nand then modifed the initial size of the database file to a value\ngreater than it's maxsize, then the value of maxsize was not updated\ncorrectly (ideally in this case maxsize should become equal to initial\nsize). As a result, query to SQL Server returned false value for\nmaxsize due to which incorrect values were getting displayed on portal\nfor attributes in Database Detail, Device Detail and Filegroup Detail\nattribute groups.\n\nDEFECT: 170994\nAbstract: Incorrect value displayed for Database Detail attributes\nwhen autogrowth disabled and data freespace > drive freespace.\nAdditional Information: In cases when data file autogrowth was disabled\nand data freespace was greater than device freespace then incorrect\nvalue were seen for some attributes(Data Freespace , Aggregate Database\nFreespace , Database Space pct used , Aggregate Database Freespace pct,\nDatabase max growth size). \n\nDEFECT: 171127\nAbstract: Add tolerance support for SQL Server 2017.\nAdditional Information: Added support for SQL Server 2017 version.\n\nDEFECT: 171244\nAbstract: Spelling mistake in agent configuration panel.\nAdditional Information: Few spelling mistakes in agent configuration\npanel were corrected.\n\nDEFECT: 171318\nAbstract: Usage of KOQ_ODBC_DRIVER variable in pre-req while making\nsql server connection.\nAdditional Information: During pre-requisite check, the value of\n\u2018Driver\u2019 was hardcoded to \u2018SQL Server\u2018. While later on, for collecting\ndata value for 'Driver\u2019 was picked from \u2018KOQ_ODBC_DRIVER\u2019 variable.\nDue to this, issue was seen during pre-requiste connection but later\non data was being collected successfully.\n\nDEFECT: 171379\nAbstract: High Severity vulnerabilities are resolved to avoid undefined\nbehaviour of the agent.\nAdditional Information: Removed the high severity errors in the code,\ndetected in CPPCheck tool.\n\nDEFECT: 171785\nAbstract: DBD_TEMP rename failed with error [32]\nAdditional Information: Renaming of DBD_TEMP to DBD_PREV files was\nfailing with Error 32 (The process cannot access the file because it\nis being used by another process)because DBD_TEMP file handle was\ntaking time to close. \n\nDEFECT: 171979\nAbstract: Incorrect value is being sent when query is failed in SRV1\ncursor.\nAdditional Information: Zero value was being sent when query fails in\nSRV1 cursor which was incorrect. Zero is a meaningful value which does\nnot indicate failure.\n\nDEFECT: 171981\nAbstract: Not Collected value is frequently sent since database\ndetail collection is not getting completed in 45 seconds.\nAdditional Information: When database detail collection took more\nthan 45 seconds for collection, Not collected values were sent which\nresulted into triggering of situation.\n\nDEFECT: 172173\nAbstract: Environment setting for COLL_DBCC_NO_LOCK was not taking\neffect. Similar issue was seen with COLL_MONITOR_ALL_DATABASES.\nAdditional Information: Values were getting overwritten for above two\nvariables, hence queries were running without NoLock hint and monitoring\nof all database setting was not working as expected.\n\nDEFECT: 173699\nAbstract: No data get collected for server summary attribute group.\nAdditional Information: SRV3,one of the pre-cursor of server summary\nattribute group, was failing as its query was executed with (null)\noption. Hence no data was collected for server summary attribute group.\n\nDEFECT: 174076\nAbstract: MSSQLQA: Sometime server detail data is not getting displayed\non portal.\nAdditional Information: SRV3, one of the pre-cursor of server summary\nattribute group, was failing as its query was executed with (null)\noption. Hence sometimes server detail data was not getting displayed\non portal.\n\nDEFECT: 174077\nAbstract: crypted SQL password in log file.\nAdditional Information: Encrypted password value in logfile is \nreplaced with fixed length string to avoid security breach.\n\nDEFECT: 174420\nAbstract: Last Statistics Query execution failing for table details\nattribute group.\nAdditional Information: Due to query failure,table detail data was\ncollected only for the first time. From second collection onwards,\nnew data was not collected & portal always showed the data collected\nduring first collection.\n\nDEFECT: 175117\nAbstract: Table detail attribute group query was failing for syntax error\nat where clause and returned null\nAdditional Information: The query which gets executed while include/exclude\ndatabases is on, was containing two consecutive \"where\" and hence \nwas failing. This issue is seen with SQL Server 2014 and above versions. \n\nDEFECT: 175120\nAbstract: Data is not collected properly with the non default SQL\nODBC driver.\nAdditional Information: Due to incorrect size calculated for some\ndata types, either query\u2019s result set processing was failing or the\ndata was getting truncated. As a result data was not getting collected\nproperly for some attributes.\n\n2.3 Enhancements:\n-----------------\nRFE: 50594\nAbstract: Support AlwaysOn feature for SQL developers edition.\nAdditional Information: Added support for SQL Server Developers\nEdition's AlwaysOn feature.\n\n2.4 Superseded fixes\n--------------------\nNone\n\n2.5 APARs and defects included from superseded fixes\n----------------------------------------------------\nNone\n\n3.0 Architecture and prerequisites\n==================================\nThis fix is supported on all operating systems listed in the \nIBM Tivoli Monitoring: Microsoft SQL Server agent prerequisites Document,\nversion 6.3.1 or from the following link:\nhttp://www-969.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity-reports/report/html/softwareReqsForProductByComponent?deliverableId=A54AA300920511E292EE9F030925FE1B&duComponent=Server_A5707A80920511E292EE9F030925FE1 [http://www-969.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity-reports/report/html/softwareReqsForProductByComponent?deliverableId=A54AA300920511E292EE9F030925FE1B&duComponent=Server_A5707A80920511E292EE9F030925FE1]\n\n\nThe following link is for the Tivoli operating system and application\nsupport matrix.

The default value\nfor CANDLEHOME is '/opt/IBM/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'\non Windows systems.\n\nBefore installing this fix on UNIX systems, set the environment\nvariable CANDLEHOME to the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation\ndirectory.\n\nFor example:\n> CANDLEHOME=/opt/IBM/ITM\n> export CANDLEHOME\n\n- Refer to section 7.0 entitled \"Known problems and workarounds\"\nbefore installation.\n\n- Because there is no uninstall utility for this fix, make sure to\nperform a backup of your environment before installing this fix.\n\n5.2 Local agent update\n----------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n(6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001.tar or .zip) to a temporary directory\non the system that contains the agent code to be updated. For\nthe purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP> represents the\nfully qualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems\nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a\ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the \nsupported platforms.\n\n3. Use the \"itmpatch\" command to install the fix for that agent\nplatform. For more information on the \"itmpatch\" command, see\nsection 6.2.\n\nOn Windows systems, if the fix was expanded to\n<TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001, the install command is:\n\nFor 32 bit Agent:\n> <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME>\n-i <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\KOQ_winnt_tema_if0001.cab\n\nFor 64 bit Agent:\n> <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> \n-i <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\KOQ_wix64_tema_if0001.cab\n\nNote : Use \"itmpatch\" command from <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\ \ntemporary directory.\n\n5.3 Remote agent update\n-----------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n(6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001.tar or .zip) to a temporary directory\non the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server system. For the\npurpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP> represents the fully\nqualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems\nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a \ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the \nsupported platforms.\n\n3. To add the agent fix bundles into the remote deploy depot, use\nthe \"tacmd addBundles\" command found in $CANDLEHOME/bin on UNIX\nsystems or in %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin on Windows systems. For more\ninformation on the \"tacmd addBundles\" command, see the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring Administrator's Guide.\n\nOn UNIX systems,\nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>/6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001:\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>/6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\n\nOn Windows systems,\nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\n\nwhere:\n-n indicates that prerequisite bundles are not automatically\nadded. The -n parameter must be used because the fix \ndirectory does not contain any prerequisites that the fix\nmight require. Please see Section 3.1 for the prerequisites\nfor this fix.\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to \nbe added to the depot. \n\n4. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server, and deploy\nthe fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use\nthe following \"tacmd\" commands. For more information on the\n\"tacmd login\" and \"tacmd updateAgent\" commands, see \"IBM Tivoli \nMonitoring Command Reference\".\n\nOn UNIX systems: \n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd updateAgent -t OQ -n <Managed system name> -v 063113001\n\nOn Windows systems:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd updateAgent -t OQ -n <Managed system name> -v 063113001\n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is \nspecified as two characters (oq), not three characters (koq).\n- The node (-n) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is the\nmanaged system name of the operating system (OS) agent to be\nupdated.\nThe target node for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is always\nan OS agent.\n\n5. To check if Remote Agent Update is SUCCESS/INPROGRESS/FAILED use the command \n>tacmd getDeployStatus -g <transaction id>\n\nwhere transaction id is the id provided after updateAgent command.\n\n5.4 Agent support update\n------------------------\nUse the following steps to update the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or Tivoli Enterprise\nPortal Desktop.\n\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001.tar or .zip) to the Tivoli \nEnterprise Monitoring Servers, Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nServers, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktops.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems\nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a \ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported\nplatforms.\n\n3. Expand the archive file (koq_tems_teps_tepd_if0001.tar or .zip)\nthat contains the updates for Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, and Tivoli Enterprise\nPortal Desktop using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems or an \nextract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a \ndirectory structure that includes a subdirectory called CD-ROM,\nwith the necessary updates.\n\n4. Use the Application Support Installer(ASI) script to launch either \nGUI installation or silent installation of the application \nsupport files. \n\nNote: For IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3 or above, one\nof the following additional steps must be performed.\n\n1. Acquire a platform-specific pre-packaged JRE version \nof the Application Support Installer (ASI). See IBM \nTivoli Monitoring Application Support Installer, \n6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002 at \nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924]\nfor download and installation instructions.\n\n2. Specify the '-j javahome' parameter with the path to \na java(r) 1.5 or java 1.6 installation when running \nthe itmasi.sh or itmasi.bat script described below. \n\nGUI installation option\n------------------------\nThe GUI can be started by using one of the following commands\nfrom within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is located.\n\nOn UNIX systems:\n> ./itmasi.sh [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nOn Windows systems:\n> itmasi [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nwhere:\n-h <CANDLEHOME> - Required. The path to the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory.\n\n-j <JAVAHOME> - Optional. The fully-qualified path to the\n\"bin\" directory where Java(R) is installed.\nThe location of Java on your system might\nvary.\n\nWhen prompted by the Application Support Installer for the \ninstallable media directory, select the CD-ROM directory, not\nthe component directory. The installer can install updates for \nmultiple components at the same time.\n\nSilent installation option\n--------------------------\nTo use the silent installation option, use one of the following\ncommands from within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is \nlocated. \n\nNote: Agent support upgrade for IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3 \nor above on Linux, zLinux, Solaris and windows operating systems \nrequires the following files contained in interim fix \n6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002. This is applicable to both GUI and \nsilent installation option of agent support upgrade.\n- Linux: setupLinux.bin\n- zLinux: setupLinux390.bin\n- Solaris: setupSolaris.bin\n- Windows: setupwin32.exe\n\nFollow the installation instructions contained in the\n\"6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002.README\".\n\nOn UNIX systems:\n> ./itmasi.sh -h <CANDLEHOME>[-silent] \n[-r <response file>] \n[-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nOn Windows systems:\n> itmasi -h <CANDLEHOME> [-silent] \n[-r <response file>] \n[-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nwhere:\n-h <CANDLEHOME> - Required. The path to the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory.\n\n-r <response file> - Required. Customized response file name.\nThe default response file \"response.txt\" in\nthe CD-ROM directory can be copied and\nmodified as per your environment.\n\n-j <JAVAHOME> - Optional. The fully-qualified path to the\n\"bin\" directory where Java(R) is installed.\nThe location of Java on your system might\nvary.\n\n5. The next panel presented by the Application Support Installer \nasks for the selection of which Tivoli Monitoring components\nyou want to add application support to.\nFor this fix, the check boxes should be set as follows:\n\nChecked - Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server(TEMS)\nChecked - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server(TEPS)\nChecked - Tivoli Enterprise Desktop Client(TEPD)\n\nContinue through the remaining GUI panels selecting the\nMicrosoft SQL Server 06.31.13.01 support to complete the\ninstallation.\n\nNote: When support is installed using CLI or GUI for any of the\nabove Tivoli Monitoring components, they are restarted. \n\n\n6. If the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop or Tivoli Enterprise\nPortal Browser was running when the update was installed, it\nmust be restarted.\n\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n=======================================\nAny existing Microsoft SQL Server Agent instances should be restarted\nafter the installation of this fix.\n\n6.1 Installation instructions for agent baroc file\n--------------------------------------------------\nFix (6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001) includes changes to the agent\nbaroc files which need to be reinstalled. If you have already\ninstalled these baroc files, there are no additional installation\nsteps. If not, refer to IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Installation\nand Setup Guide under \"Installing monitoring agent baroc files\non the event server\" in \"Installing the IBM Tivoli Enterprise\nConsole Event Synchronization\" section for more information.\n\n6.2 Additional information on using \"itmpatch\" command\n----------------------------------------------------\nThe \"itmpatch\" command has the following syntax.\n\nUsage: itmpatch -h <installation home> [OPTIONS]\n\nitmpatch -h <installation home>\n-t { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }\n\nitmpatch -h <installation home>\n-i { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }\n\nwhere:\n-h Specifies the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory\n-i Specifies the path to the directory or patch file to be \ninstalled\n-t Generates a report of the actions to be taken by the patch\n\nFor example, on UNIX systems:\n- To preview the fix installation, use the \"-t\" option:\n> <CANDLEHOME>/bin/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -t <TEMP>\n\n- To install the fix, use the \"-i\" option:\n> <CANDLEHOME>/bin/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -i <TEMP>\n\nwhere:\n<CANDLEHOME> is the fully qualified IBM Tivoli Monitoring \ninstallation directory. On Windows systems, this path must include\nthe drive letter.\n<TEMP> represents the fully qualified directory specification where\nthe fix is located. On Windows systems, this must include the drive\nletter.\n\n6.3 Verifying the update\n------------------------\n1. To verify the agent was updated correctly, use the \"tacmd\" command\nto view the agent's current version after the agent is restarted.\nYou are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer prior to viewing the agent version.\n\nFor example:\nOn UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli \nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis '/opt/IBM/ITM'.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t OQ\n\nOn Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t OQ \n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the tacmd \"listSystems\" command is \nspecified as two characters (OQ), not three characters (KOQ).\n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is:\n06.31.13.01.\n\nAfter the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify\nthe agent was successfully updated.\nFor the agent on Windows systems, the version number is \n06.31.13.01.\n\n2. To verify the agent support files were updated correctly, use \nthe \"kincinfo\" command on Windows systems or the \"cinfo\" command\non Linux or UNIX systems.

Collecting this MustGather information before calling IBM support will help you understand the problem and save time analyzing the data. \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n\n\nCOLLECTING DATA\nIdentified problems  1. Application server/agent server/integration is frozen or almost non-responsive  * \n     * Threads are stuck at database due to long running queries or due to blocking locks. \n     *  Long running processes taking significant time and/or too many threads running in parallel. \n     *  Stale entries in the database slowing down the processes with trying to ping every URL in yfs_heartbeat during cache refresh/broadcast. \n     *  Any network related issues \n     *  Frequent Full GCs of very long interval \n    \n     * \n     * 3 to 4 sets of Thread dumps collected at intervals of 20 to 30sec should give clarity on why and where in the process the threads are stuck i.e., At database, performing cache refresh, or any other reason. Note: Most JVMs redirects thread dumps to system out logs. It is necessary to redirect system out of JVM process to some log file to obtain thread dumps. for example, java > log_file 2>1& IBM java redirects thread dump to its own file. Look for an output file in the installation root directory with a name like javacore.date.time.id.txt \n     *  If blocking lock issue at DB, 'Blocking Lock SQL' output results need to be analyzed understand the processes, tables and the queries involved in blocking. \n     *  If overall DB slowness but not due to blocking locks, AWR report can be analyzed to identify the specific SQLs causing the issue. \n     *  If cache refresh is the problem, number RMI threads can be checked to see if the number is very high. yfs_heartbeat table records can be verified to check if there are too many stale entries. Stale entries can be updated temporarily. yfs_heartbeat can be truncated when all app/agent JVMs are down. Health monitor should run to avoid the situation in future. \n     *  If memory/GC is the problem, increasing the heapsize or tuning the GC parameters would help \n    \n    \n 2. Application/agent/integration server crash, shutdown  * \n     * Out-Of-Memory - Java heap space - causing the server crash \n     * OOM - StackOverFlow - causing the server crash \n     * Abnormal kill signal issues by external process/script/OS level  * \n        *  If OOM Java heap space, Memory parameters (Xmx, Xms), GC logs, thread stack (logs) and heapdumps need to be collected. \n        *  If OOM Stack-Overflow, Memory parameters (Xmx, Xms, Xss), Error logs and thread dumps need to be collected => Custom code issue or tuning Xss could help in most occasions. For waves with large number of shipments (nWMS), often seen that Tuning Xss helps (documented in perf guide). \n        *  Server level logs would help understanding if there are any external issues causing the crash. \n       \n       \n    \n    \n 3. Agent process is very slow, backlog of messages  * \n     *  Agent processing messages at very slow rate due to overall high time consumption => DB queries slow or long running process with additional services, external calls. \n     * Frequent Full GCs due to memory issues \n    \n     * \n     * SQLDEBUG logs of the agent. \n     * AWR report \n     *  GC logs. \n    \n    \n 4. Database: Too many blocking locks  * \n     *  SELECT for UPDATE queries fired by agent/application server are taking too much time waiting for acquiring lock. \n    \n     * \n     * Output of blocking lock SQLs \n     * AWR report \n     * Once above information is obtained, kill root blocker from DB side. This process will generate error stack in IBM Sterling Application logs. \n    \n    \n 5. DB high CPU, slow response  * \n     *  Slow response from database for the query fired by the product \n    \n     * \n     *  AWR Report \n    \n    \n 6. Deadlocks from application and agent servers  * \n     * Deadlock can occur between two or more processes \n    \n     * \n     *  Yantra Deadlock logs, SQLDEBUG logs for the processes identified \n     *  Oracle deadlock logs (if yantra deadlock logs not available) and AWR report \n    \n    \n 7. Application/Queue specific errors in agent logs  * \n     * Error details \n    \n    If possible, set yfs.app.identifyconnection=Y in customer_overrides.properties while collecting diagnostic data from database (blocking lock SQLs or AWR report or yantra deadlock trace).

Unix error code 24.\n\nNew sockets/file descriptors can not be opened after the limit has been reached. \n\n\nCAUSE\nSystem configuration limitation.\n\nWhen the \"Too Many Open Files\" error message is written to the logs, it indicates that all available file handles for the process have been used (this includes sockets as well). In a majority of cases, this is the result of file handles being leaked by some part of the application. This technote explains how to collect output that identifies what file handles are in use at the time of the error condition.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n\n\n\n\nDetermine Ulimits\n\nOn UNIX and Linux operating systems, the ulimit for the number of file handles can be configured, and it is usually set too low by default. Increasing this ulimit to 8000 is usually sufficient for normal runtime, but this depends on your applications and your file/socket usage. Additionally, file descriptor leaks can still occur even with a high value. \n\nDisplay the current soft limit:\nulimit -Sn\n\nDisplay the current hard limit:\nulimit -Hn\n\nOr capture a Javacore, the limit will be listed in that file under the name NOFILE:\nkill -3 PID\n\n\nPlease see the following document if you would like more information on where you can edit ulimits:\nGuidelines for setting ulimits (WebSphere Application Server)\nhttp://www.IBM.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21469413 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21469413]\n\n\nOperating Systems \n\nWindows By default, Windows does not ship with a tool to debug this type of problem. Instead Microsoft provides a tool that you can download called Process Explorer [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653]. This tool identifies the open handles/files associated with the Java\u2122 process (but usually not sockets opened by the Winsock component) and determines which handles are still opened. These handles result in the \"Too many open files\" error message. \n\nTo display the handles, click on the Gear Icon [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&amp;aid=1] in the toolbar (or press CTRL+ H to toggle the handles view). The icon will change to the icon for DLL files (so you can toggle it back to the DLL view). \n\nIt is important that you change the Refresh Rate. Select View > Update Speed, and change it to 5 seconds. \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&aid=2] \n\nThere is also another Microsoft utility called Handle that you can download from the following URL: \nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896655.aspx [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896655.aspx] \n\nThis tool is a command line version of Process Explorer. The URL above contains the usage instructions. \n\n\nAIX \nThe commands lsof and procfiles are usually the best commands to determine what files and sockets are opened.. \n\nlsof \nTo determine if the number of open files is growing over a period of time, issue lsof to report the open files against a PID on a periodic basis. For example: \n\nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nThis output does not give the actual file names to which the handles are open. It provides only the name of the file system (directory) in which they are contained. The lsof command indicates if the open file is associated with an open socket or a file. When it references a file, it identifies the file system and the inode, not the file name. \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\nprocfiles \nThe procfiles command does provide similar information, and also displays the full filenames loaded.

For example: \n\nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nThe output will provide you with all of the open files for the specified PID. You will be able to determine which files are opened and which files are growing over time. \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\n\nAlternately you can list the contents of the file descriptors as a list of symbolic links in the following directory, where you replace PID with the process ID. This is especially useful if you don't have access to the lsof command: \n\nls -al /proc/PID/fd \n\n\nSolaris Run the following commands to monitor open file (socket) descriptors on Solaris: \n\npfiles \n/usr/proc/bin/pfiles [ PID ] > pfiles.out \n\nlsof \nlsof -p [ PID ] > lsof.ou t \n\nThis will get one round of lsof output. If you want to determine if the number of open files is growing over time, you can issue the command with the -r option to capture multiple intervals: \nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\nHP-UX \nlsof \nlsof -p [ PID ] > lsof.out \n\nThis will get one round of lsof output. If you want to determine if the number of open files is growing over time, you can issue the command with the -r option to capture multiple intervals: \nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers Runtimes for Java Technology Java SDK", "content_type": "text", "id": "swg21067352"}, "is_correct_answer": true, "is_correct_document": true, "origin": "gold-label", "answer": {"answer": "On UNIX and Linux operating systems, the ulimit for the number of file handles can be configured, and it is usually set too low by default.

The TBSMAgent code was last\nupdated with TBSM 6.1.1 Fixpack 1\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\n2.0 Hardware and software requirements\n----------------------------------\n\nFor information about hardware and software requirements, see the\nTivoli Business Service Manager Installation Guide on the IBM\nTivoli Business Service Manager Information Center (at IBM Knowledge Center):\n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/welcome.htm [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/welcome.htm]\n\nTo apply this Fix Pack you will need 3 GB of disk space. Please check\nthe amount of space you have before you install, as the installation\nwill fail if you run out of space.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n3.0 Installation information\n------------------------\n\n3.1 Dependencies\n\nThis Fixpack must be installed on each server(s) that is running \nthe TBSM data server or TBSM dashboard server.\n\nThis Fixpack requires IBM Tivoli Business Service Manager \nVersion 6.1.1 to be installed.\n\n3.2 Prerequisites\n-------------\n\nTivoli Integrated Portal 2.2.0.15 version 2 (v2) has been certified. It\ncan be installed after installing this fix pack.\n\nIBM strongly recommends updating to TIP FP 2.2.0.15 v2, if support is\nrequired for FF ESR 31 and IE11. If the TBSM data server and dashboard \nserver are installed on different machines, the TIP Fix Pack needs to be \ninstalled only on the dashboard server. In case of a TIP HA environment, \nthe HA nodes need to be disjoined first before upgrading to TIP FP.\n\nSee Fix Central for availability:\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Tivoli&product=ibm/Tivoli/Tivoli+Integrated+Portal&release=2.2.0.15&platform=All&function=all [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Tivoli&product=ibm/Tivoli/Tivoli+Integrated+Portal&release=2.2.0.15&platform=All&function=all]\n\nPost installation of TIP 2.2.0.15 v2 requires a re-start of the\nDashboard server and clearing of all user's browser cache!\n\n3.3 Special considerations\n----------------------\n\nConsider this information before you install the Fix Pack:\n1. You will be prompted during the installation to specify a backup\ndirectory name. The installer backs up DE at this location.\n\n2. This Fixpack does not backup the entire application. It only\nbacks up the files that it has updated/replaced. A backup copy of the\noriginal files can be retrieved from:\n[InstallDirectory]/tipv2/logs/tbsm/maintenance/backup/6.1.1.0/FP0003\n\n3. The TBSM and TIP processes or services may remain running but, will \nbe re-started during the Fix Pack install process. If the processes\nor services are manually stopped, prior to the Fix Pack install,\nplease make sure both the OMNIbus Object server and DB2 processes or\nservices remain running!\n\nNOTE: The installer will start/stop the TBSM and TIP services as\nneeded, during the install process.\n\nOn Linux/Unix: perform the following\n\n1. To stop the TBSM Data server issue the following command:\n\n$TIP_HOME/profiles/TBSMProfile/bin/stopServer.sh server1 \n-username <adminuser> -password <adminpassword> \n\n2. To stop the TBSM Dashboard server, issue the following \ncommand:\n\n$TIP_HOME/profiles/TIPProfile/bin/stopServer.sh server1 \n-username <tipadminuser> -password <adminpassword> \n\nBy default, username is tipadmin and password is the \ntipadmin password.\n\n3. To stop the TBSM Discovery Library Toolkit issue the \nfollowing command:\n\n$TBSM_HOME/XMLtoolkit/bin/tbsmrdr_stop.sh \n\nOn Windows:\n\n1. In the Start menu, click Settings -> Control Panel\n-> Administrative Tools -> Services.\n\nThe Services window opens. Depending on what services \nyou have installed, the available services are as follows: \n\nTivoli Business Service Manager - TBSMProfile_Port_17310. \nThis is the Data server. \nTivoli Integrated Portal - V2.2_TIPProfile_Port_16310.\nThis is the Dashboard server. \nTivoli BSM Discovery Library toolkit \nEIF probe \nThis service appears only if the EIF probe was installed \nas a Windows service. \n\n2. Right-click the service that you want to stop and click Stop.\n\n\n4. All non-vital programs should be closed prior to installation of \nthe Fixpack. \n\n\n3.4 Superceded Fixes\n----------------\n\n6.1.1.0-TIV-BSM-IF0001 is superceded by this Fix Pack.\n6.1.1.0-TIV-BSM-IF0002 is superceded by this Fix Pack.\n6.1.1.0-TIV-BSM-IF0003 is superceded by this Fix Pack.\n6.1.1.0-TIV-BSM-IF0004 is superceded by this Fix Pack.\n6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001 is superceded by this Fix Pack.\n6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0002 is superceded by this Fix Pack.\n\n\n3.5 Extracting Fix Pack files\n-------------------------\n\n3.5.1 Extracting on Linux, Solaris, Linux for System z, and AIX \nplatforms\n\n1. Copy the file 6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0003-<ARCH>.tar to a temporary\nlocation on your TBSM Server.\n\n2. Unpack the file on each host where you need to install the Fix\nPack using these commands:\n\ntar -xvf 6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0003.<ARCH>.tar\n\n\n3.5.2 Extracting on Windows platforms\n-------------------------------\n\n1. Copy the 6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0003-windows.zip file to a temporary\nlocation on your TBSM server host.\n\n2. Unzip the file on each server where you need to install the Fix Pack.\n\n\n3.5.3 Fix pack directories\n--------------------\n\nWhen you extract the file, these directories are created: \n\nTBSM -TBSM data server and dashboard server and TIP updates.\n\nDiscoveryLibrary -Discovery Library Toolkit updates\n\n<ARCH>/Reports\n\nSamples\n\n\n3.6 Maintenance upgrade strategy\n----------------------------\n\nBefore you install the Fix Pack, you need to plan how and when you will\nupgrade each TBSM server in your environment. \n\n\n3.6.1 Example maintenance scenario\n----------------------------\n\nIn this example, the maintenance is staged into two phases to\nreduce the time required for the TBSM maintenance window.\n\nIn this example environment, there are four servers: \n* primary data server\n* backup data server\n* two dashboard servers set up for load balancing called: dash1\nand dash2\n\nFollow this sequence:\n\nBefore you start the maintenance window: \n1. Upgrade backup data server\n2. Upgrade one dashboard server (for example dash2)\n3. Use the primary data server and dash1 for regular production\nactivities\n\nAfter you complete the upgrade the two secondary servers, start\nthe maintenance window down time for the production servers.\n1. Upgrade primary data server\n2. Upgrade dash1\n\nAfter you complete the upgrade for all the servers: \n1. Start primary data server\n2. Start backup data server\n3. Wait until TBSM completes the server synchronization.\n4. Start the dashboard servers. \n\n\n3.7 Installation\n------------\n\n\n3.7.1 Installing the Fix Pack\n-----------------------\n\n[Fix Pack] Refers to the directory where you extracted the Fix\nPack files from the zip/tar file.\n\nAttention: Install the Fix Pack with the same user that was\nused to install TBSM 6.1.1 GA\n\n\nNOTE: If you have deployed the Service Level Objectives (SLO) \nReporting Function, you must do the following before\ninstalling the Fix Pack:\n\n- Stop all Impact services that are running policies that\ncall the SLO functions to record data in the SLORPRT\ndatabase. If you have the service set to start at\nserver startup, then turn this option off before\ninstalling the fixpack, as the server is restarted\nduring the fixpack install.\n\nRunning the install without DE backup:\n\nIf you prefer to backup DE with your own procedures you can\nrun the install with the following parameter.\n\n-DNO_BACKUP=true\n\n(for Silent Install, uncomment the \"NO_BACKUP=true\" \nparm on the setupFP.rsp response file)\n\nIf you choose this method, you must backup DE before you install.\nAnd restore the original system using your backup/restore\nprocedures or utilities (if uninstalling the Fix Pack).\n\nFollow this procedure to install the Fix Pack:\n\n1. On the Tivoli Business Service Manager server host, change to the\n[Fix Pack]/TBSM directory where you extracted the files.\n2. Run the installation using one the following commands:\n* setup-windows.exe - Windows.\n* setup-<unixplatform>.bin - other operating systems.\n\nInstallation command options:\n\nGUI mode No options, for example: \nWindows: setup-windows.exe\n\nor\n\nUNIX\u00ae : ./setup-<unixplatform>.bin \n\nConsole mode\nUse the -i console option. \nFor example -\nWindows: setup-windows.exe -i console\n\nor \n\nUNIX\u00ae : ./setup-<unixplatform>.bin -i console\n\nSilent Mode\n\na. Copy setupFP.rsp from the TBSM directory of the extracted\nFix Pack file ([Fix Pack]/TBSM) to a location it can be\nedited (/tmp).\nb. Update the file to match your environment.\nc. Confirm acceptance of license, by un-commenting this line\nand setting the parm to \"true\":\n#LICENSE_ACCEPTED=false\nd. Run:\n\nWindows: setup-windows.exe -f C:\\tmp\\setupFP.rsp\n\nor \n\nUNIX\u00ae :setup-<unixplatform>.bin -f /tmp/setupFP.rsp\n\nNote: The response file needs to have a fully qualified\npath.\n\n3. During the install you will be asked to to verify\npath names to the TIP install.\n\n4. Restart both the Data and Dashboard processes/services\n\n5. After install is complete (and with the data server started), run\nthe script ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3, which can be found on the Data\nServer under $TBSM_HOME/bin. This script loads the new/updated\npolicies.\n\nNOTE: Do not run the ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3 on the secondary/\nbackup data server of a failover pair. This only needs to\nbe run on the primary data server.\n\nOn Windows:\n\nApplyPoliciesFor611FP3.bat <adminuser> <adminpassword>\nFor example - ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3.bat tipadmin tipadmin\n\nOn Linux/Unix:\n\n./ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3 <adminuser> <adminpassword>\nFor example - ./ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3 tipadmin tipadmin \n\nNOTE: Verify that the admin user id and password are\ncorrect otherwise, the script will fail at the last step.\n\nIf incorrect, rerun the script with a valid adminuser id\nand password.\n\n6. From the TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack 3 install media, copy these files\nonto the DB2 server (where the tbsmdb was initially installed,\nwhen TBSM was first setup).\n\nfrom: [Fix Pack]/TBSM/TBSMDBChecker\nto: [InstallDirectory]/tbsmdb/bin\n\nTBSM_Check_DB.bat\nTBSM_Check_DB.sh\ntbsmDatabaseChecker.xml\nTBSMDBChecker.props\n\nNOTE: The above action is only needed if you ever plan to use\nthe TBSM_Check_DB script, which will now suppress the\ndisplay of the requested user password.\n\n7. After installing this Fix Pack, end-users may need to clear their\nbrowser cache, close and re-open the browser; in order to avoid\nany issues on the client side.\n\n8. If the Impact \"Service Level Objectives (SLO) Reporting\"\nfunction was enabled, please refer to section 3.12 for additional\npost Fix Pack installation required actions.\n\n9. Please refer to section 4.0 \"Additional information for TBSM Fix Pack 3 APARS\"\nfor additional post install actions.\n\n\n3.7.2 Discovery Library Toolkit\n-------------------------\n\n1. Navigate to the DiscoveryLibrary directory.\n\n2. To install Fixpack 3, \n\nIf you are on a Windows operating system, run the following\ncommand from a prompt: \n\nsetup-dltoolkit-6.1.1-FP0003-windows_64.exe\n\nIf you are on a Unix operating system, run the following\ncommand from a prompt:\n\nsetup-dltoolkit-6.1.1-FP0003-<unixplatform>_64.bin\n\nFor console mode, specify \"-i console\".\n\nNote: If the installer cannot find the TBSM 6.1.1 Discovery \nLibrary Toolkit, verify that the toolkit is installed and \nthat it was installed by the user that the fixpack is being \ninstalled with. If these are both okay, then set the environment\nvariable TBSM_TOOLKIT_BASE to the location of the toolkit and \nrestart the toolkit installer. For example: \nWindows:\nset TBSM_TOOLKIT_BASE=C:\\Program Files\\IBM\\tivoli\\tbsm\\XMLtoolkit\nUNIX:\nexport TBSM_TOOLKIT_BASE=/opt/IBM/tivoli/tbsm/XMLtoolkit\n\n3. The toolkit installer requires access to the database.\n\n\n4. Notes and Post-Install Considerations:\n\na) After installation is complete, you may remove\n[fixpack] to save space.\n\n5. Restart the toolkit.\n\n\n3.8 TBSM agent\n----------\n\nInstalling the TBSM agent (last updated with TBSM Fix Pack 1):\n\nThe following packages are available for download in the TBSMAgent\ndirectory on the support download site:\n\n* AIX: KR9_aix526CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.tar.gz -AIX (64 bit) \n\n* Linux: KR9_lx8266CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.tar.gz -Li x86_64R2.6(64 bit)\n\n* Solaris: KR9_sol286CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.tar.gz -Solaris R8(64 bit)\n\n* Windows: KR9_wix64CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.zip -(64 bit)\n\n* zLinux: KR9_ls3266CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.tar.gz -Li S390R2.6(64 bit)\n\n\nTo install the updated TBSM agent (FP1), if not already installed:\n1. Download the appropriate agent code for your platform.\n2. Untar or unzip the file.\n3. Install the agent according to the directions in the TBSM\nInstallation Guide. This is a complete install package for the TBSM\nagent support and can be used for a fresh install of the agent.\n\nFor instructions on installing and configuring the TBSM agent, see:\n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/installguide/bsni_agent_ic_install_config.html [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/installguide/bsni_agent_ic_install_config.html]\n\n\n3.9 Uninstalling the Fix Pack\n-------------------------\n\nBefore uninstalling the FixPack all TBSM processes should be\nSTOPPED. The user must manually stop the TBSM processes, before \nthe uninstall of the FixPack (except for OMNIbus and DB2).\n\nAttention: Uninstall the Fix Pack with the same user that was used to\ninstall TBSM 6.1.1 GA.\n\nSilent mode and uninstall\n\n\nIf silent mode was used for the install, the uninstall will\ndefault to a silent uninstall and you must supply a response\nfile or the uninstall will fail.\n\nFor silent mode uninstalls, copy the setup_uninstall.rsp file\nfrom the Fix Pack image to the directory:\n\n<installDir>/tbsm/_uninst/TBSM611_FP3\n\nand update the file with the correct information. Then launch\nthe installer specifying the file. For example:\n\nuninstall(.exe) -f /tmp/setup_uninstall.rsp\n\nNote: The response file needs to have a fully qualified path.\n\nOn the Tivoli Business Service Manager server system:\n\n1. Change to the directory: \n<installDir>/tbsm/_uninst/TBSM611_FP3\n\n2. Run the uninstall command:\n\nUNIX: If you are on a Unix operating system, run the following\ncommand from a prompt.\n\n./uninstall\n\n\nWindows: If you are on a Windows operating system, run the following\ncommand from a prompt.\n\n.\\uninstall.exe\n\nFor console mode, specify \"-i console\"\n\n3. After the command has completed, run the following commands to clear\nthe server cache.\n\nLinux/AIX: <TIP_HOME>/bin/clearClassCache.sh\n\nSolaris: java -Xshare:dump\n\nWindows: <TIP_HOME>\\bin\\clearClassCache.bat\n\n\n\n4. Uninstall eWAS 7.0.0.35\n\nNOTE: On a \"Data server only\" environment, the TBSM 6.1.1 Fix\nPack 3 un-installer will not remove the upgraded eWAS\n7.0.0.35 Fix Pack it installed. If there are plans to, at\na future time, re-install TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack 3, it is\nnecessary to manually un-install eWAS 7.0.0.35. \n\nThese steps DO NOT apply to a \"Dashboard sever only\"\nenvironment or a \"Single server\" environment, where both the\nData and Dashboard are installed together.\n\nAgain, these steps are only needed on a \"Data server only\"\nenvironment. Failure to perform these actions, will prevent\nthe re-install of TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack 3!\n\na). Copy the uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt to a temporary location\nThe uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt file is located on:\n<installdir>/tbsm/_uninst/TBSM611_FP3/plan/install/MachinePlan_localhost/00002_WASFP/uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt\n\nFor example on Unix:\n/opt/IBM/tivoli/tbsm/_uninst/TBSM611_FP3/plan/install/MachinePlan_localhost/00002_IAGLOBAL_COI_STEP_WASFP/uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt\n\nFor example on Windows:\nC:\\IBM\\tivoli\\tbsm\\_uninst\\TBSM611_FP3\\plan\\install\\MachinePlan_localhost\\00002_IAGLOBAL_COI_STEP_WASFP\\uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt\n\n\nOr from the TBSM 6.1.1 FP3 install media:\n6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0003-<ARCH>\\TBSM\\COI\\PackageSteps\\WASFP\\uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt\n\n\nb). Edit the uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt (on the temporary location)\n\nc). locate this line: -W product.location=\"@IAGLOBAL_WAS_HOME@\"\n\nd). Replace above line with: -W product.location=\"<installdir>/tipv2\"\n\nWhere <installdir> is the fully qualified directory where tipv2 located:\n\nfor example (Unix): -W product.location=\"/opt/IBM/tivoli/tipv2\"\n\nfor example (Windows): -W product.location=\"C:\\IBM\\tivoli\\tipv2\"\n\ne). Save the uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt file (on the temporary location)\n\nf). Execute the following command:\nOn Unix:\n<installdir>/tipv2/WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7/update.sh -options <templocation>/uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt -silent\n\nfor example: /opt/IBM/tivoli_root/tipv2/WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7/update.sh -options /tmp/uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt -silent\n\nOn Windows:\n<installdir>/tipv2/WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7/update.exe -options <templocation>/uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt -silent\n\nfor exampe: C:\\IBM\\tivoli\\tipv2\\WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7\\update.exe -options C:\\Temp\\uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt -silent\n\n5. Restart the Data Server and Dashboard Server.\n\n\n\nDiscovery Library Toolkit\n===================================================\n\nThe Toolkit portion of this fixpack cannot be uninstalled.\nA backup copy of the original files can be retrieved from:\n\n[InstallDirectory]/tbsm/\nXMLtoolkit/log/install/maintenance/backup/611FP0003\n\n\n\n3.10 Recovering from a failed Fix Pack install\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIf the install fails, try to uninstall in which case, it goes back to\nthe previous version. If there is no uninstall file under \n_uninst/TBSM611_FP3, then nothing really got installed and you can delete\nthe TBSM611_FP3 file and reinstall.\n\n\n3.11 Restoring failed DE upgrade from backup\n---------------------------------------\n\nTo recover a failed Deployment Engine upgrade in TBSM 6.1.1, see the\nTBSM Installation Guide at: \n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/installguide/bsmi_upgrade_t_restore42.html [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/installguide/bsmi_upgrade_t_restore42.html]\n\n\n3.12 \"Service Level Objectives (SLO) Reporting\" function\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe information in this section applies only if you have deployed\nthe Impact Solution called \"Service Level Objectives (SLO)\nReporting\". The SLO function is enhanced by Fixpack 3 for:\n\n* Support of a time zone specification when creating the SLA\ndefinitions\n\n* Detection of active outages in the sample policy that reads\nfrom a TBSM Metric History database\n\n* Bug fixes and improved documentation\n\nFor this function, See the 'SLO Reporting' topic under Impact\n6.1.1 at the following url:\n\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSHYH_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.netcoolimpact.doc/solution/imsg_slo_reporting_c.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSHYH_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.netcoolimpact.doc/solution/imsg_slo_reporting_c.html]\n\nIf you have NOT deployed this solution, then you can skip this\nsection!\n\n\nAfter installing the Fixpack, but BEFORE restarting any SLO services:\n\n1) Update the SLORPRT database schema\n\na) You will need access to the machine where the SLORPRT\ndatabase was installed. If this database has not been\ninstalled, then the SLO solution has not been deployed\nand there is no need to continue this update to the\nschema.\n\nb) If necessary, copy files add_timezone.sql and\nupdate_views_timezone.sql from \n[InstallDirectory]/impact/add-ons/slo/db\nto a location accessible from the system you will use\nto update the database schema in the next step.\n\nc) Open a DB2 command window on a system with access to\nthe SLORPRT database and run the following commands:\n\ndb2 connect to SLORPRT user dbuser using dbpassword\n( replace dbuser and dbpassword with the\nuser/password specified in datasource\nSLOReportDatasource )\n\ndb2 -tvf <slo_sql_dir>/add_timezone.sql\n\ndb2 -tvf <slo_sql_dir>/update_views_timezone.sql\n\ndb2 connect reset\n\nWhere <slo_sql_dir> would be \n[InstallDirectory]/impact/add-ons/slo/db if on the \nsame machine as the Impact Data server, or the directory\nwhere you copied the files in step b if the SLORPRT\ndatabase is on a different machine\n\n\n2) Once the Fixpack is installed and the SLORPRT database\nschema has been updated, you should start any Impact\nservices configured for SLO processing. Remember to check\nthe option to start the service when the server starts,\nif that is how you originally configured the service.\n\n=======================================================================\n4.0 Additional information for TBSM Fix Pack 3 APARS:\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following APARs fixed in this service delivery require additional\naction by users. If your environment uses or is experiencing the\nsymptoms described, use the instructions provided to complete the fix.\n\n4.1 IV30875 - ERROR CTGBC0053E WHEN SELECTING SERVICE IN A CANVAS\nCustomers are now allowed to persist their log file settings \nwithout manually editing the server.xml file. Currently, customers\nuse the setTraceLevel script to set the maximum number of log files\nand the size of these of files using the following method:\n\n$TBSM_HOME/bin/setTraceLevel.sh <user> <pw> data/dashboard -setTraceOutputToFile 30 40\n\nNow they will be able to persist these sizes by using the following\ncommand.\n\n$TBSM_HOME/bin/setTraceLevel.sh <user> <pw> data/dashboard -setstartup\n\nBefore this change, the call would only persist changes to the trace\nlevel. Now it persists changes to the trace level as well as the log\nfile configurations.\n\n\n4.2 IV65545 - TBSMEVENTREADER STOPS BECAUSE EVENT PROCESSOR BLOCKING ON\nRADEVENTSTORE\n\nThe following SQL statements needs to be run after FP install, against \nthe TBSM DB2 Database:\n\nCREATE INDEX RADEVENTSTORE_IDX1 ON TBSMBASE.RADEVENTSTORE(RADSERIAL) COLLECT STATISTICS\n\nThe above SQL statement can be found on the following file:\n\n./tipv2/profiles/TIPProfile/installedApps/TIPCell/isc.ear/sla.war/install/AddRADEventStoreIndex.sql\n\nPlease provide the above file to the TBSM DB2 Database Administrator, \nalong with the following Notes:\n\nNotes: \n1) Use\ncat AddRADEventStoreIndex.sql | db2\nto run the SQL. The command must be run against all DB2 databases\nused for TBSM. The command does not require a server stop/start.\n\n2) The ; delimiter is not used in the AddRADEventStore.sql file\n- whether the delimiter is required or not depends on the\nconnection settings (-t option).\n\n3) Typical output from the SQL: cat AddRADEventStoreIndex.sql | db2\ndb2 => db2 => db2 => DB20000I The SQL command completed successfully.\ndb2 => db2 => DB20000I The SQL command completed successfully.\ndb2 => db2 => DB20000I The RUNSTATS command completed successfully.\n\n4) Typical output from the SQL (if the index already exists)\ndb2 => db2 => DB20000I The SQL command completed successfully.\ndb2 => db2 => SQL0605W The index was not created because an index\n\"TBSMBASE.RADEVENTSTORE_IDX\" with a matching definition already exists.\nSQLSTATE=01550\ndb2 => db2 => DB20000I The RUNSTATS command completed successfully.\n\n5) Other warning:\nSQL2314W Some statistics are in an inconsistent state. The newly\ncollected \"INDEX\" statistics are inconsistent with the existing \n\"TABLE\" statistics. SQLSTATE=01650\n\nTo address the message above, RUNSTATS Is Run after the index is\ncreated. \n\nAs well as the changes in the index there are 2 \nconfigurations changed required for this APAR\n\na) Increase the number of allowed connections for the TBSMDatabase \nData Source.\n\nThis can be done via the Impact GUI screen (Data Model) or via\nthe file tbsm\\etc\\TBSM_TBSMDatabase.ds\n\nIncrease the number from default 15 to 50 (or to limit \nrecommended by DB2 Admin)\n\nTBSMDatabase.DB2.MAXSQLCONNECTION=15\nto\nTBSMDatabase.DB2.MAXSQLCONNECTION=50\n\nIf changing via file, then a Data Server restart is required.\n\n\nb) Set the LOCKTIMEOUT in DB2 to 30 seconds.

By default,\n# the TADDM hostname is used. But in cases there TADDM is\n# configured in failover, objects imported from the Primary\n# TADDM and Backup TADDM will have different hostnames \n# used for building MSS. This will mean 2 MSS associated\n# with objects.\n# \n# When setting a string for the alias, use the primary taddm \n# hostname.\n#\nDL_AliasForMSS = PrimaryTaddmHostname\n#\n# Note: Launch in Context uses the MSS hostname to build the \n# sourceContactInfo value, which is used to contact the TADDM \n# server. For this reason, when TADDM is configured in Failover, \n# a front end server (load balancer) is required, to route Launch\n# In Context requests to the active server. This will ensure \n# requests are routed to the secondary TADDM server, when the \n# primary is down.\n\nIV65503 ESDA DOES NOT CLEAN OLD SERVICE IDENTIFICATION FIELDS\nThe property \"UseESDAIdentifiersOnly\" can be added, as an\nadditional parameter to the child Template, which will allow\nusers to select if they want previous event identifiers on a\nservice to be kept or erased with each invalidation. \n\nWhen set to \"true\", all previous event identifiers will be \nerased from TBSM memory model at each invalidation and the\nservice will only accept identifiers from ESDA policies or via\nSCR API. When set to \"false\", all event identifiers, old or\nnewly added will be preserved for the service. User must\nmanually delete event identifiers that they do not wish to\nkeep. This is TBSM's default behaviour. \n\nIV65786 TBSM CIRCULAR REFERENCES ISSUE\nThere will be two new properties added in TBSM_sla.props file\nthat governs the check:\n\nProperty name: impact.sla.servicetreedepthlimit\nDescription: When the data is imported from TADDM, a depth\nlimit check will be done to the corresponding service tree \nduring invalidation to ensure that the service tree has normal\nrelationship data. This property governs the depth limit for\nthe service tree. If the system detects a service tree with\ndepth level larger than the value set by this property, a \nwarning service instance will be created to warn the user to\nreview their data relationship.\n\nDefault value: 20\n\nProperty name: impact.sla.disableimportalldescendantslimitcheck\nDescription: When set to \"true\", the service tree depth limit\nwill not be checked during invalidation.\n\nDefault value: false\n\nIV62246 DATA SOURCE FAILOVER SETTINGS CLASH BETWEEN TBSM AND IMPACT\nThe APAR handles the issue of TBSM Failover settings for Data\nSources. Impact back-end java code handled whether or not\nfailover (or failback) is initiated in times of Data Source\nfailure. This back-end Impact code only uses the \nFAILOVERPOLICY settings in the .ds files\n\nThe APAR change has been in the TBSM interfaces to setting up\nData Source. There are 2 interfaces 1) GUI screen (as above)\nand 2 radshell (createDataSource and export functions). \n\n1) TBSM GUI: The TBSM GUI will now set the FAILOVERPOLICY\nsetting in the .ds file. When editing existing files, if\nno valid FAILOVERPOLICY exists, then the current\nDISABLEFAILOVER setting will be used to determine a new\nFAILOVERPOLICY setting, i.e. if no valid FAILOVERPOLICY\nexists, then if DISABLEFAILOVER is true, FAILOVERPOLICY \nwill be set to DISABLED. If DISABLEFAILOVER is false,\nFAILOVERPOLICY will be set to FAILOVER\n\nTake good note of the above. It means that existing data\nsources will have a new FAILOVERPOLICY set, when they are\nfirst saved via the GUI. Previously if FAILOVERPOLICY was\nnot valid, Impact assumed FAILOVER. But if you edit a data\nsource, and the data source has DISABLEFAILOVER = true,\nand no valid policy set, then the new value for\nFAILOVERPOLICY is DISABLED. This is correct behaviour, but\ndifferent to before. The best was to avoid any confusion,\nit to check each .ds file and ensure that a valid\nFAILOVERPOLICY is set. Do this either by editing the files\n(in which case a Data Server restart is required) or by\nopening each data source in the GUI. Not all Data Sources\nwill appear in the GUI (as some are built in). For these,\ncheck the files. If editing files, ensure no spaces at the\nend of settings. The only valid values for FAILOVERPOLICY\nare DISABLED, FAILOVER and FAILBACK.\n\n2) radshell: The Radshell interface also changes. The export()\nfunction will now export the failover policy, and the\ncreateDataSource takes a policy parameter (in place of the\nboolean disablefailover parameter), Also, the old\ncreateDataSource radshell function, will still work (for\nbackward compatibility with old exports). Note: Data Sources \nexported with IV62246 in place, will NOT work on old\nsystems-as the generated radshell command will contain a\npolicy string. \n\nThe following IMPACT APARs are delivered with

See Fix Central for availability:\n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Tivoli&product=ibm/Tivoli/Jazz+for+Service+Management&release=All&platform=All&function=all [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Tivoli&product=ibm/Tivoli/Jazz+for+Service+Management&release=All&platform=All&function=all]\n\n\n\n=======================================================================\n6.0 New support and features\n------------------------\n\n6.1 TBSM 6.1.1 Fixpack 3\n--------------------\nFix Pack 3 includes the following enhancements:\n\n1) Template Editor: sort items in \"Rules\" table\n\nAdjusting the logic that handles the order of the rules displayed in\nthe table on the Rules tab. The following are the new rules each\nof the columns will adhere to:\n\nType column\n> use the same icon as the toolbar action that created the rule\n> tooltips describe the rule's type\n\nRule Name column\n> all rule names are now sorted A-Z \n> A-Z ordering maintained as rules are created and/or deleted \n> tooltips describe the rule's type; same as Type column\n> the display order will not be customer configurable\n\nRule Settings column\n> minor styling tweaks to assist readability\n\nThe above enhancement is specific to the TBSM console\n\n2) Tree Template datasets: enable use of internal status attributes in\n\"Tree Template Editor\"\n\nExtended the capability of the Tree Template datasets by allowing\nTBSM internal status attributes to be selected on the editor UI's\nTemplate Rule Mapping section.\n\nWhen Tree Template Viewed in TIP-based Service Tree\n\nWithout processing by the customization policy, these new status\nattributes will display as the standard TBSM status values: \n0.0, 3.0, or 5.0. \n\nThe above, enhances the TBSM Data Provider function and benefits\nthe DASH users.\n\n3) Datasets need a parameter to optionally exclude \"starting\" or\n\"container\" services.\n\nWith the addition of the Tree Template datasets in TBSM 6.1.1\nFixpack 1, we now have more situations where the administrator may\nwish to exclude the starting or container service from a view.\n\nThe above, enhances the TBSM Data Provider function and benefits\nthe DASH users.\n\n4) Support parameter to filter datasets in TBSM_Services datasource\nby template\n\nThe parameter would be available on the datasets in the \nTBSM_Services datasource, which includes the \"All_TBSM_Services\"\nand \"TBSM_Urgent_Services\" datasets\n\nThe above, enhances the TBSM Data Provider function and benefits\nthe DASH users.\n\n5) \"UrgentServices\" dataset added\n\nThis new dataset makes the service model data that was displayed\nin the legacy Urgent Services portlet available for display using\nthe List and Table widgets.\n\nThe above, enhances the TBSM Data Provider function and benefits\nthe DASH users.\n\n6) Managing Dataset Dynamic Updates\n\nAll datasets available from the TBSM UI Data Provider automatically\nsend updates when the content changes. This is the recommended usage\nof the TBSM datasets, but there may be scenarios where the user\nwould like to turn off the dynamic updating.\n\nThe above, enhances the TBSM Data Provider function and benefits\nthe DASH users.\n\nMore information can be found in the new \"Dynamic Updating and the\nTBSM UI Data Provider\" document on the TBSM Advanced Topics page at\nthe TBSM developersWorks site\n\n7) Tivoli Netcool/Impact provides new property to ascertain which Data\nProvider field is used, when retrieving ITM data from the REST\nService\n\n8) Enhancements to the Impact Solution called \n\"Service Level Objectives (SLO) Reporting\". The SLO function\nis enhanced by Fixpack 3 for:\n\n* Support of a time zone specification when creating the SLA\ndefinitions\n\n* Detection of active outages in the sample policy that reads from\na TBSM Metric History database\n\n* Bug fixes and improved documentation\n\n\nSee the Advanced Topics at the TBSM developerWorks site for new and\nupdated information:\n\nhttps://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/Tivoli%20Business%20Service%20Manager1/page/Advanced%20Topics [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/Tivoli%20Business%20Service%20Manager1/page/Advanced%20Topics] \n\n\n6.2 TBSM 6.1.1 Fixpack 2\n--------------------\n\n1) NUMERICAL RULES NOT CALCULATED ON TBSM RESTART\nNumerical Aggregation rules are triggered by a child metric rule\nchange, i.e. OverallAttribute. When the status of a child changes, the\nOverallAttribute metric rule's value will change and any Numerical \nAggregation rules, based on OverallAttribute, will be recalculated. \nWhen TBSM is restarted, only services which have related existing \nevents will have their status recalculated. Therefore not all Numerical\nAggregation rules (based on OverallAttribute) will be recalculated on \nTBSM restart, as some services will be green. \n\nThis may not be the desired outcome. On restart, it may be required\nthat all Numerical Aggregation rules are restarted. New functionality \nhas been provided for such a scenario, by forcing a bubble up of state \nnodes. The code can be triggered from a policy, for leaf nodes\nonly, or for all, as shown here: \n\nUSE_SHARED_SCOPE;\n\nType=\"StateModel\";\nFilter = \"RECALCSTATENODESLEAF\";\nlog(\"Recalc Leaf Node Only. Policy Start.\" );\nGetByFilter(Type, Filter, false); \nlog(\"Recalc Leaf Node Only. Policy Finish.\" );\n}\n\n\nUSE_SHARED_SCOPE;\n\nType=\"StateModel\";\nFilter = \"RECALCSTATENODESALL\";\nlog(\"Recalc All Nodes. Policy Start.\" );\nGetByFilter(Type, Filter, false); \nlog(\"Recalc All Nodes. Policy Finish.\" );\n}\n\nThe above policy code needs to be scheduled from Impact Services on\nstartup.\n\n\n\n2) TBSM SLAM EVENTS ONLY GENERATED IF THE RULE OUTPUT CHANGES\nIf a client wants SLAM event text for a Numerical rule, to update\n(even if it's value does not change), the following parm needs to be\nun-commented and set to \"true\"\n\n#If true then send SLAM events, even when the value of a Metric rule does NOT change.\n#Default is false.\n#Omnibus de-duplication will handle the rest.\n#impact.sla.sendslameventsformetricrulealways=true\n\n\n\n6.3 TBSM 6.1.1 Fixpack 1\n--------------------\n\n1) The BSM_Templates.radsh defines service templates for common TBSM services.\nIt was executed when you installed the TBSM GA release(not during the fixpack \ninstall). It's default template rules propagate child status to the parent \nservice based on child template changes. The script has been updated to set \nthe propagation type to instance propagation. When the child service status \nchanges, it will propagate the change to the parent service regardless of\nwhich child template rule caused the status change. See the Service \nConfiguration publication for more information about the aggregation rule \noption.\n\nTo update the rules with the instance propagation option in your current \ninstallation, you can invoke the \n$TBSM_HOME/install/BSM_Templates_updatepropation.radsh script.\n\nIf you re-execute the $TBSM_HOME/install/BSM_Templates.radsh script \nto re-create the templates, the rules will be configured with \nthe instance propagation option.\n\n\n2) The recommended version of JRE plugin is Sun JRE 1.7.0_51 or 1.8 for \nInternet Explorer and Firefox.\n\n3) Additional toolkit customization has been made. To pick up these\nchanges, run the following commands on the Data Server:\n\nWindows:\n\ncd %TBSM_HOME%\\install\ntype BSM_TemplateUpdates611FP0003.radsh | %TBSM_HOME%\\bin\\rad_radshell\n\nUNIX:\n\ncd $TBSM_HOME/install\ncat BSM_TemplateUpdates611FP0003.radsh | $TBSM_HOME/bin/rad_radshell\n\n4) As noted in the following Technote, When configuring pages in DASH \n(JazzSM) for TBSM datasets, it is often desirable to create them\nin a development environment and then later move them to\nproduction, perhaps via a test environment. With this Fix Pack and\nin conjunction with JazzSM 1.1 Fix Pack 2, there is no need to create\ntwo connections any longer.\n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660077 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21660077]\n\n5) TBSM 6.1.1 Fixpack 1 will support the use of a rich hover function in\nDASH (JazzSM). The TBSM UI data provider will now send the information\nneeded in order for a DASH user to configure a widget for rich hover \nsupport. To enable the rich hover in DASH you must:\n\nConfigure TBSM 6.1.1 to collect the registry information required to\nsupport the rich hover in TBSM 6.1.1. This configuration is documented\nat http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/customization/bsmc_oslc_config_dataserverconfg.html [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/customization/bsmc_oslc_config_dataserverconfg.html].\nThe rich hover option will not be available in DASH for widgets\nconfigured with a TBSM dataset if the oslcconfig has not been run.\n\nConfigure DASH (UI Services) for access to JazzSM Registry Services.\nConfiguration of the required property is described at \nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEKCU_1.1.0.3/com.ibm.psc.doc_1.1.0.3/tip_original/dash_t_twl_uipreview_resource_reg.html [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEKCU_1.1.0.3/com.ibm.psc.doc_1.1.0.3/tip_original/dash_t_twl_uipreview_resource_reg.html].\n\nNote that if enabled in DASH, rich hover will be shown for the same\nservices that support the rich hover in the TBSM 6.1.1 console. If \nconfigured for a widget, and there is no rich hover information, \nthen the flyover on the DASH widget will show nothing. Also note \nthat the DASH environment requires Single Sign On be configured \nbetween the various components required to gather the preview \ninformation (DASH, TADDM, ITM, etc.)\n\n6) TBSM 6.1.1 Fixpack 1 adds a new UI data provider data source that\nprovides new datasets corresponding to the customer's tree templates.\nThis allows the same data to be visualized in the legacy Service Tree\nas well as on a JazzSM/DASH page.\n\n\n6.4 Additional Browser Support with Fixpack 3\n\nNone!\n\n6.5 Additional Browser Support with Fixpack 2\n-----------------------------------------\n\nTBSM 6.1.1 supports FF ESR 10 and FF17 with Fix Pack 1 on TIP 2.2.0.11 (or below).\n\nThis Fix pack supports Internet Explorer 9(IE9) in \n\"Internet Explorer 9\" browser mode which is the default mode, not \nin \"Internet Explorer 9 Compatibility View\" browser mode.\nThe document mode is automatically set by TIP and should remain\n'IE7 standards'.\n\nIBM strongly recommends updating to TIP 2.2.0.15 version 2 (v2) if\nsupport is required for FF ESR 24/31 and/or IE10/11\n\nSee Fix Central for availability:\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Tivoli&product=ibm/Tivoli/Tivoli+Integrated+Portal&release=2.2.0.15&platform=All&function=all [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Tivoli&product=ibm/Tivoli/Tivoli+Integrated+Portal&release=2.2.0.15&platform=All&function=all]\n\n\n\n6.6 eWAS Fixes and Upgrades\n-----------------------\n\nPlease Note: The TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack will upgrade WebSphere (eWAS) on the Data\nserver automatically, to version 7.0 Fix Pack 35 (7.0.0.35) but, only if the Dashboard\nserver is not installed on that environment. If the Dashboard server is installed on the\nsame server (in the case of a single server environment), the eWAS will not be upgraded.\n\neWAS upgrade, on the TBSM Dashboard server and on \"Single server\" environments, will\ntake place when TIP 2.2.0.15 is applied.\n\nIf un-installing TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack, refer to section 3.9 \"Uninstalling the Fix Pack\"\nto manually remove eWAS 7.0.0.35 (on Data server only environments!).\n\n\n6.7 OMNIbus 8.1\n-----------\nTBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack 1 supports the use of OMNIbus 8.1. But, please note that\nOMNIbus 8.1 is a separate install, requiring additional configuration changes to\nmake it work with TBSM. Refer to \"IBM Tivoli Netcool OMNIbus Considerations\" section\nof the \"Exploring TBSM\" Guide:\n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/installguide/bsmi_c_netcool_omnibus.html [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/installguide/bsmi_c_netcool_omnibus.html]\n\nIf using OMNIbus 8.1, IBM recommends upgrading to the latest 8.1\nmaintenance level (at the moment, Fix Pack 2).\n\nIf using JazzSM/DASH to display TBSM resources, the Event Viewer and/or AEL may fail to display the appropriate\nTBSM events if (1) a Data Source is not setup to point to TBSM's OMNIbus and (2) the custom TBSM filters and views are\nnot defined to WebGUI. To setup the WebGUI views, it will be required to copy the following file from\nthe TBSM Dashboard server to a temporary location on the JazzSM server:\n\n<installdir>/tipv2/profiles/TIPProfile/installedApps/TIPCell/isc.ear/sla.war/install/webtopcore/create_tbsm_views.xml\n\nIn addition to copying the file to the JazzSM server, it is necessary to execute the runwaapi command, to load filters/views\nthe WebGUI. On the JazzSM/DASH server, execute the following command:\n\n<installdir>/netcool/omnibus_webgui/waapi/bin/runwaapi -file create_tbsm_views.xml -user <admin> -password <password>\n\nPlease refer to the integration document found in \"Advanced Topics\"\nat the TBSM developerWorks site, for this and other topics:\n\nTBSM developerWorks Advanced Topics: https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/Tivoli%20Business%20Service%20Manager1/page/Advanced%20Topics [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/Tivoli%20Business%20Service%20Manager1/page/Advanced%20Topics]\nIntegration document: https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/groups/service/html/communityview?communityUuid=7d5ebce8-2dd8-449c-a58e-4676134e3eb8#fullpageWidgetId=Wea1cb2531f10_4ccd_99d7_6ab0334cb21f&file=c6d51b71-362e-44be-8aa2-650da0918ac7 [https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/groups/service/html/communityview?communityUuid=7d5ebce8-2dd8-449c-a58e-4676134e3eb8#fullpageWidgetId=Wea1cb2531f10_4ccd_99d7_6ab0334cb21f&file=c6d51b71-362e-44be-8aa2-650da0918ac7]\n\n\n6.8 DB2 \n---\nStarting with TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack 2, TBSM supports the use of DB2\nversion 10.5.3\n\n\n6.9 TADDM 7.3 Integration\n---------------------\nFor import of Business Applications from TADDM 7.3 to TBSM 6.1.1, the\nproperty com.ibm.cdb.serviceinfrastructure.earlier.ver.compatibility\nmust be set to \"true\" in collation.properties file (located under\ntaddm/dist/etc). This will be true by default for upgraded TADDM 7.3\nservers. It is false by default for fresh TADDM 7.3 installs. \n\nNote: TADDM restart is required after property modification.\n\nIf com.ibm.cdb.serviceinfrastructure.earlier.ver.compatibility is \nflipped from false to true, then all Business Applications need to be \nre-build, to regenerate backward compatible Business Applications. This \ncan be done by either waiting for scheduler to process all Grouping \nPatterns (and recreate new and old Business Applications) or by manually \nexecuting (all or selected) Grouping Patterns from TADDM UI (or command\nline).\n\n\n=======================================================================\n7.0 Known issues - \n------------\n\n7.1 Some date options in TBSM Reports do not work\n\nWhen specifying the date parameters for reports, some options \nlike \"last 30 days\" do not work. However, one can get this data\nfor the reports by selecting the Date Range and choosing the \ndates from the calendar. Below is a link to the TBSM reports in\nour Service Configuration guide which outlines how to run reports.\n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/ServiceConfigurationGuide/bsmu_rept_view_reports.html [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/ServiceConfigurationGuide/bsmu_rept_view_reports.html]\n\n\n\n7.2 Issues creating wire between Service Tree and Active \nEvent List (AEL)\n\nIf the user creates a wire between the Service Tree and AEL\nwhen a page is first created, the wire does not work. The\nworkaround for this is to create a wire by editing the page\nafter the page has been created and saved. \n\n\n\n7.3 TBSM Agent Chart title differs from name in the \ndrop down list \n\nName displayed at the top of a TBSM Agent Chart differs from\nthe name of that chart in the drop down list. For eg,\nthe chart name in the drop down list is \"kr9_TBSM Service Status\" \nand the name shown at the top of the chart is \"Kr9:KR91003\". \nThe name at the top can be changed to display the same name \nas the drop down list by going to Preferences and changing \nthe chart name.\n\n\n\n7.4 Minimize-restore does not restore to correct size for\nService Navigation->Data/Data Fetchers on Internet Explorer(IE)9 \n\nIn the Service Navigation->Data/Data Fetchers portlet, after the \nminimize option has been exercised to minimize the portlet, the \nportlet is not resized correctly after using the 'restore' option.\nThe window resizes to a smaller size. This is an issue on\nInternet Explorer(IE) 9 but not on Firefox or on Internet \nExplorer(IE) 8. In order to go back to the original size, \nselect 'maximize' and 'restore'. \n\n\n\n7.5 Portlets covering content in a free form page\n\nWhen creating free form pages, the Service Viewer and Active Event \nList(AEL) portlets will always be on top of any content. This can \ninterfere with page layout and editing of portlet preferences. \nTo alleviate this issue, it is best to place these portlets \nonto the created page last to avoid having other content covered \nby them. If a page requires editing and contains Service Viewer \nor Active Event List portlets, it may be necessary to move \nthose portlets out of the way before editing preferences of \nother portlets.\n\n\n\n7.6 Creation and deletion of Services and Templates that contain\nspecial characters\n\nDue to new security additions the deletion of services and templates\nthat contain the characters '+', '&', '<','>','%',' \" ', is not\npermitted through the browser. Some of these characters are\npermitted on the creation of services, as services can still be\ncreated with these through auto population and importing. The \ndeletion of these services will now have to be carried out\nthrough the radshell command deleteServiceInstance. \n\nMore information on the command can be found here.\n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.0/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc_6.1/adminguide/bsma_shlr_service_delete.html [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.0/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc_6.1/adminguide/bsma_shlr_service_delete.html]\n\n\n\n\n7.7 WEBSERVICES SECURITY NOT FUNCTIONAL\nIf using WebService Security when making a WebService call,\n(callProps.EnableWSS=true), the jar file \ntipv2/plugin/org.apache.axis2.jar must be replaced by the jar\nfile tbsm/lib3p/org.apache.axis2-woden.jar and the newly replaced\nfile must be renamed to org.apache.axis2.jar.\n\nRestart is required.\n\n7.8 If using WEBSERVICES SECURITY (WSS) user authentication, then the\nimpact/dsa/wsdsa/wss/conf/wscb.properties needs to be altered to\nonly have one entry. If there is more than one entry in the file,\nonly the uid.1 and pwd.1 will be read\n\n7.9 Microsoft Internet Explorer 11.\nIE11 (supported only with TIP 2.2.0.15) may cause unexpected\nbehaviour in the Policy Editor, whereby the Policy List panel\ndisappears when the Project drop-down menu is selected. To\ncircumvent this, simply click on a different project in the Project\ndrop-down list and then click again on the desired project, to\nrestore the correct layout\n\n7.10 With certain Solaris installations the Event Summary portlet\n(Administration -> Service Administration -> Services) may fail to\nrender and cause an Out Of Memory (PermGen) exception (as seen in\nthe TIP trace log:\n\"java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space exception\")\n\n\nSolution: \n1. Stop TBSM (kill the hung server if necessary).\n\n2. Goto the $TBSM_HOME/tipv2/profiles/TIPProfile/config/cells/TIPCell/nodes/TIPNode/servers/server1\ndirectory and make a backup of the server.xml file.\n\n3. Open the server.xml file for editing and in the jvmEntries xmi\ntag modify the genericJvmArguments attribute to read something\nlike this, where these two PermSize and MaxPermSize parms are\nbeing added (if other parms are already code, please preserve\nthose parms and just insert the two new ones): \n\ngenericJvmArguments=\" -XX:PermSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -XX:+DisableExplicitGC\"\n\n4. Save the file and restart TBSM.\n\n\n7.11 TIP Portlet blank or does not load after TIP 2.2.0.15 installation\nRefer to the following Technote for resolution:\n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21696426 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21696426]\n\nNOTE: The above issue is resolved also in TIP 2.2.0.15 (version 2)\n\n7.12 TIP chart portlet blank if TBSM Service Admin page is closed and \nre-opened\nRefer to the following Technote for resolution:\n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21696424 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21696424]\n\nNOTE: The above issue is resolved also in TIP 2.2.0.15 (version 2)\n\n7.13 TBSM integration with ISM is no longer operational and will be\nremoved from the next TBSM version 6.1.1 Fix Pack. \nThis modification is due to changes in the supported versions of\nITCAM for Transaction / ISM.\n\n7.14 Java Security Warnings\nWith the ever changing security improvements to both the browsers\nJava Runtime Environment (JRE), clients are now more likely to see\nwarning messages about untrusted connections or invalid\ncertificates. To avoid those issues, clients can replace the IBM\nHTTP Server SSL certificate with an SSL certificate signed by a\nthird-party CA.

If you have the service set to start at\nserver startup, then turn this option off before\ninstalling the fixpack, as the server is restarted\nduring the fixpack install.\n\nRunning the install without DE backup:\n\nIf you prefer to backup DE with your own procedures you can\nrun the install with the following parameter.\n\n-DNO_BACKUP=true\n\n(for Silent Install, uncomment the \"NO_BACKUP=true\" \nparm on the setupFP.rsp response file)\n\nIf you choose this method, you must backup DE before you install.\nAnd restore the original system using your backup/restore\nprocedures or utilities (if uninstalling the Fix Pack).\n\nFollow this procedure to install the Fix Pack:\n\n1. On the Tivoli Business Service Manager server host, change to the\n[Fix Pack]/TBSM directory where you extracted the files.\n2. Run the installation using one the following commands:\n* setup-windows.exe - Windows.\n* setup-<unixplatform>.bin - other operating systems.\n\nInstallation command options:\n\nGUI mode No options, for example: \nWindows: setup-windows.exe\n\nor\n\nUNIX\u00ae : ./setup-<unixplatform>.bin \n\nConsole mode\nUse the -i console option. \nFor example -\nWindows: setup-windows.exe -i console\n\nor \n\nUNIX\u00ae : ./setup-<unixplatform>.bin -i console\n\nSilent Mode\n\na. Copy setupFP.rsp from the TBSM directory of the extracted\nFix Pack file ([Fix Pack]/TBSM) to a location it can be\nedited (/tmp).\nb. Update the file to match your environment.\nc. Confirm acceptance of license, by un-commenting this line\nand setting the parm to \"true\":\n#LICENSE_ACCEPTED=false\nd. Run:\n\nWindows: setup-windows.exe -f C:\\tmp\\setupFP.rsp\n\nor \n\nUNIX\u00ae :setup-<unixplatform>.bin -f /tmp/setupFP.rsp\n\nNote: The response file needs to have a fully qualified\npath.\n\n3. During the install you will be asked to to verify\npath names to the TIP install.\n\n4. Restart both the Data and Dashboard processes/services\n\n5. After install is complete (and with the data server started), run\nthe script ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3, which can be found on the Data\nServer under $TBSM_HOME/bin. This script loads the new/updated\npolicies.\n\nNOTE: Do not run the ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3 on the secondary/\nbackup data server of a failover pair. This only needs to\nbe run on the primary data server.\n\nOn Windows:\n\nApplyPoliciesFor611FP3.bat <adminuser> <adminpassword>\nFor example - ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3.bat tipadmin tipadmin\n\nOn Linux/Unix:\n\n./ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3 <adminuser> <adminpassword>\nFor example - ./ApplyPoliciesFor611FP3 tipadmin tipadmin \n\nNOTE: Verify that the admin user id and password are\ncorrect otherwise, the script will fail at the last step.\n\nIf incorrect, rerun the script with a valid adminuser id\nand password.\n\n6. From the TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack 3 install media, copy these files\nonto the DB2 server (where the tbsmdb was initially installed,\nwhen TBSM was first setup).\n\nfrom: [Fix Pack]/TBSM/TBSMDBChecker\nto: [InstallDirectory]/tbsmdb/bin\n\nTBSM_Check_DB.bat\nTBSM_Check_DB.sh\ntbsmDatabaseChecker.xml\nTBSMDBChecker.props\n\nNOTE: The above action is only needed if you ever plan to use\nthe TBSM_Check_DB script, which will now suppress the\ndisplay of the requested user password.\n\n7. After installing this Fix Pack, end-users may need to clear their\nbrowser cache, close and re-open the browser; in order to avoid\nany issues on the client side.\n\n8. If the Impact \"Service Level Objectives (SLO) Reporting\"\nfunction was enabled, please refer to section 3.12 for additional\npost Fix Pack installation required actions.\n\n9. Please refer to section 4.0 \"Additional information for TBSM Fix Pack 3 APARS\"\nfor additional post install actions.\n\n\n3.7.2 Discovery Library Toolkit\n-------------------------\n\n1. Navigate to the DiscoveryLibrary directory.\n\n2. To install Fixpack 3, \n\nIf you are on a Windows operating system, run the following\ncommand from a prompt: \n\nsetup-dltoolkit-6.1.1-FP0003-windows_64.exe\n\nIf you are on a Unix operating system, run the following\ncommand from a prompt:\n\nsetup-dltoolkit-6.1.1-FP0003-<unixplatform>_64.bin\n\nFor console mode, specify \"-i console\".\n\nNote: If the installer cannot find the TBSM 6.1.1 Discovery \nLibrary Toolkit, verify that the toolkit is installed and \nthat it was installed by the user that the fixpack is being \ninstalled with. If these are both okay, then set the environment\nvariable TBSM_TOOLKIT_BASE to the location of the toolkit and \nrestart the toolkit installer. For example: \nWindows:\nset TBSM_TOOLKIT_BASE=C:\\Program Files\\IBM\\tivoli\\tbsm\\XMLtoolkit\nUNIX:\nexport TBSM_TOOLKIT_BASE=/opt/IBM/tivoli/tbsm/XMLtoolkit\n\n3. The toolkit installer requires access to the database.\n\n\n4. Notes and Post-Install Considerations:\n\na) After installation is complete, you may remove\n[fixpack] to save space.\n\n5. Restart the toolkit.\n\n\n3.8 TBSM agent\n----------\n\nInstalling the TBSM agent (last updated with TBSM Fix Pack 1):\n\nThe following packages are available for download in the TBSMAgent\ndirectory on the support download site:\n\n* AIX: KR9_aix526CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.tar.gz -AIX (64 bit) \n\n* Linux: KR9_lx8266CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.tar.gz -Li x86_64R2.6(64 bit)\n\n* Solaris: KR9_sol286CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.tar.gz -Solaris R8(64 bit)\n\n* Windows: KR9_wix64CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.zip -(64 bit)\n\n* zLinux: KR9_ls3266CD-6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0001.tar.gz -Li S390R2.6(64 bit)\n\n\nTo install the updated TBSM agent (FP1), if not already installed:\n1. Download the appropriate agent code for your platform.\n2. Untar or unzip the file.\n3. Install the agent according to the directions in the TBSM\nInstallation Guide. This is a complete install package for the TBSM\nagent support and can be used for a fresh install of the agent.\n\nFor instructions on installing and configuring the TBSM agent, see:\n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/installguide/bsni_agent_ic_install_config.html [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/installguide/bsni_agent_ic_install_config.html]\n\n\n3.9 Uninstalling the Fix Pack\n-------------------------\n\nBefore uninstalling the FixPack all TBSM processes should be\nSTOPPED. The user must manually stop the TBSM processes, before \nthe uninstall of the FixPack (except for OMNIbus and DB2).\n\nAttention: Uninstall the Fix Pack with the same user that was used to\ninstall TBSM 6.1.1 GA.\n\nSilent mode and uninstall\n\n\nIf silent mode was used for the install, the uninstall will\ndefault to a silent uninstall and you must supply a response\nfile or the uninstall will fail.\n\nFor silent mode uninstalls, copy the setup_uninstall.rsp file\nfrom the Fix Pack image to the directory:\n\n<installDir>/tbsm/_uninst/TBSM611_FP3\n\nand update the file with the correct information. Then launch\nthe installer specifying the file. For example:\n\nuninstall(.exe) -f /tmp/setup_uninstall.rsp\n\nNote: The response file needs to have a fully qualified path.\n\nOn the Tivoli Business Service Manager server system:\n\n1. Change to the directory: \n<installDir>/tbsm/_uninst/TBSM611_FP3\n\n2. Run the uninstall command:\n\nUNIX: If you are on a Unix operating system, run the following\ncommand from a prompt.\n\n./uninstall\n\n\nWindows: If you are on a Windows operating system, run the following\ncommand from a prompt.\n\n.\\uninstall.exe\n\nFor console mode, specify \"-i console\"\n\n3. After the command has completed, run the following commands to clear\nthe server cache.\n\nLinux/AIX: <TIP_HOME>/bin/clearClassCache.sh\n\nSolaris: java -Xshare:dump\n\nWindows: <TIP_HOME>\\bin\\clearClassCache.bat\n\n\n\n4. Uninstall eWAS 7.0.0.35\n\nNOTE: On a \"Data server only\" environment, the TBSM 6.1.1 Fix\nPack 3 un-installer will not remove the upgraded eWAS\n7.0.0.35 Fix Pack it installed. If there are plans to, at\na future time, re-install TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack 3, it is\nnecessary to manually un-install eWAS 7.0.0.35. \n\nThese steps DO NOT apply to a \"Dashboard sever only\"\nenvironment or a \"Single server\" environment, where both the\nData and Dashboard are installed together.\n\nAgain, these steps are only needed on a \"Data server only\"\nenvironment. Failure to perform these actions, will prevent\nthe re-install of TBSM 6.1.1 Fix Pack 3!\n\na). Copy the uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt to a temporary location\nThe uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt file is located on:\n<installdir>/tbsm/_uninst/TBSM611_FP3/plan/install/MachinePlan_localhost/00002_WASFP/uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt\n\nFor example on Unix:\n/opt/IBM/tivoli/tbsm/_uninst/TBSM611_FP3/plan/install/MachinePlan_localhost/00002_IAGLOBAL_COI_STEP_WASFP/uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt\n\nFor example on Windows:\nC:\\IBM\\tivoli\\tbsm\\_uninst\\TBSM611_FP3\\plan\\install\\MachinePlan_localhost\\00002_IAGLOBAL_COI_STEP_WASFP\\uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt\n\n\nOr from the TBSM 6.1.1 FP3 install media:\n6.1.1-TIV-BSM-FP0003-<ARCH>\\TBSM\\COI\\PackageSteps\\WASFP\\uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt\n\n\nb). Edit the uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt (on the temporary location)\n\nc). locate this line: -W product.location=\"@IAGLOBAL_WAS_HOME@\"\n\nd). Replace above line with: -W product.location=\"<installdir>/tipv2\"\n\nWhere <installdir> is the fully qualified directory where tipv2 located:\n\nfor example (Unix): -W product.location=\"/opt/IBM/tivoli/tipv2\"\n\nfor example (Windows): -W product.location=\"C:\\IBM\\tivoli\\tipv2\"\n\ne). Save the uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt file (on the temporary location)\n\nf). Execute the following command:\nOn Unix:\n<installdir>/tipv2/WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7/update.sh -options <templocation>/uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt -silent\n\nfor example: /opt/IBM/tivoli_root/tipv2/WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7/update.sh -options /tmp/uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt -silent\n\nOn Windows:\n<installdir>/tipv2/WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7/update.exe -options <templocation>/uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt -silent\n\nfor exampe: C:\\IBM\\tivoli\\tipv2\\WebSphereUpdateInstallerV7\\update.exe -options C:\\Temp\\uninstall-WASEmbeded.txt -silent\n\n5. Restart the Data Server and Dashboard Server.\n\n\n\nDiscovery Library Toolkit\n===================================================\n\nThe Toolkit portion of this fixpack cannot be uninstalled.\nA backup copy of the original files can be retrieved from:\n\n[InstallDirectory]/tbsm/\nXMLtoolkit/log/install/maintenance/backup/611FP0003\n\n\n\n3.10 Recovering from a failed Fix Pack install\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIf the install fails, try to uninstall in which case, it goes back to\nthe previous version. If there is no uninstall file under \n_uninst/TBSM611_FP3, then nothing really got installed and you can delete\nthe TBSM611_FP3 file and reinstall.\n\n\n3.11 Restoring failed DE upgrade from backup\n---------------------------------------\n\nTo recover a failed Deployment Engine upgrade in TBSM 6.1.1, see the\nTBSM Installation Guide at: \n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/installguide/bsmi_upgrade_t_restore42.html [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSPFK_6.1.1.3/com.ibm.tivoli.itbsm.doc/installguide/bsmi_upgrade_t_restore42.html]\n\nDOWNLOAD PACKAGE\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload RELEASE DATE LANGUAGE SIZE(Bytes) Download Options \nWhat is Fix Central(FC)?

However, this section does not show how to manage these instances from WAS Administrative Console.\n\n\nANSWER\nBefore configuring multiple IBM HTTP Server instances, note the following statements from the product documentation: \n\n * \n * It is seldom necessary to run multiple instances, as features like virtual hosts allow a single instance to efficiently serve many sites.\n * The advantage of a single instance is that it uses less resources to serve the same requests as multiple instances.\n\n\nIf you do need multiple IBM HTTP Server instances, this technote will help you set up the Web servers so that you can manage them from WAS Administrative Console. The technote assumes you will define the multiple IBM HTTP Server instances on an unmanaged node. The Administrative Console will manage the IBM HTTP Server instances using the IBM HTTP Server Admin Server instead of a nodeagent.  \n\n \n\n \n\nApproach 1: One plug-in installation for each IBM HTTP Server instance \nIf you want to run configureWeb_server_name script to define Web servers at WAS side, you need to install plug-in multiple times: Do one plug-in installation for each IHS instance. Each plug-in installation points to a unique IHS configuration file for the IHS instance and define a new Web server. Normally, plug-in installation is done as part of IBM HTTP Server installation. In the scenario of running multiple instances of IBM HTTP Server from a single install, you can only install plug-in for one IBM HTTP Server instance. For other instances, you need to install plug-in separately. You can either run \u201claunchpad\u201d command and select to install plug-in; or you can go to plugin subdirectory to run \u201cinstall\u201d command to install plug-in. \n\nDuring plug-in installation, the install wizard will ask you to select the type of Web server. Select \u201cIBM HTTP Server\u201d. Since Web servers are unmanaged, select \u201cWeb server machine (remote)\u201d. Select a unique location for this plug-in installation. Next, the install wizard will ask you the configuration file. Browse to select the configuration file for the IBM HTTP Server instance that will be associated with this plug-in installation. Make sure the port matches the Listen directive in the configuration file you selected. \n\nThe rest of plug-in installation steps are the same as you install plug-in when it\u2019s part of IBM HTTP Server installation. Refer to the Knowledge Center page below about plug-in installation:\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_7.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tins_webplugins_remotesa.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_7.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tins_webplugins_remotesa.html] \n\nAfter plug-in installation is done, run configureWeb_server_name script at WAS side to define the Web server. All instances of IBM HTTP Server can be managed by a single IBM HTTP Server Admin Server and one unmanaged node. That means you only need one admin.conf file for the IBM HTTP Server installation. No need to create multiple admin.conf files like you need to do for httpd.conf file. \n\nWith this approach, you need to apply plug-in upgrade multiple times (one for each plug-in install) when it is time to apply maintenance. Since IBM HTTP Server was installed only once, a single upgrade will upgrade all instances. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nApproach 2: Single plug-in installation for all IBM HTTP Server instances You can manage multiple IBM HTTP Server instances with just one plug-in installation. Manual steps are required to configure each instance. First, there is no configureWeb_server_name script to create Web servers on WAS side. You need to manually define Web servers:\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_7.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tihs_remotesetup.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_7.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tihs_remotesetup.html] \n\nNext, plug-in installation will configure httpd.conf for one instance of IBM HTTP Server. You need to manually configure plug-in for the httpd.conf file of all other IBM HTTP Server instances:\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_7.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tins_manualWebIHS70.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_7.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tins_manualWebIHS70.html]", "content_type": "text", "id": "swg21509128"}, "is_correct_answer": true, "is_correct_document": true, "origin": "gold-label", "answer": {"answer": ""}, "no_answer": true}, {"query": "\n\nAfter installing IBM OMEGAMON for Messaging on z/OS 07.05.00, I receive the following ABEND after submitting PARMGEN Job KCIJPALO:\n\n      JOB02175  IEC141I 013-18,IGG0191B,U600861X,KMCJPALR,RKPDIN,600D,ISMS01,  083\n         083             HSYS.S002.OMGNEW.TKANPAR(KMCPDICT)\n     JOB02175  IEA995I SYMPTOM DUMP OUTPUT  085\n         085             SYSTEM COMPLETION CODE=013  REASON CODE=00000018\n         085              TIME=07.41.33  SEQ=00630  CPU=0000  ASID=004C\n         085              PSW AT TIME OF ERROR  075C1000   80E9E456  ILC 2  INTC 0D\n         085                NO ACTIVE MODULE FOUND\n         085                NAME=UNKNOWN\n         085                DATA AT PSW  00E9E450 - 4100302C  0A0D010D  A7E5014B\n         085                AR/GR 0: 009FF028/00E9E760   1: 00000000/A4013000\n         085                      2: 00000000/00081CB8   3: 00000000/00E9E734\n         085                      4: 00000000/009B1410   5: 00000000/009B17A4\n         085                      6: 00000000/009B174C   7: 00000000/009B17A4\n         085                      8: 00000000/009B176C   9: 00000000/00000080\n         085                      A: 00000000/00F20E10   B: 00000000/009B10FC\n         085                      C: 00000000/00000008   D: 00000000/00000000\n         085                      E: 00000000/80E9DCB4   F: 00000000/00000018\n         085              END OF SYMPTOM DUMP\n\nWhat is the cause of this?", "document": {"content": " PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION\n\nABSTRACT\n Starting with V7.5, IBM OMEGAMON for Messaging on z/OS no longer delivers the component called WebSphere MQ Configuration Agent, referred to as MQ Configuration in the rest of this document, because there are other recommended ways to configure IBM MQ. It is stabilized in the previous V7.3 release, but MQ Configuration will be supported as long as V7.3 is in support. The components in V7.5 are the IBM MQ Monitoring Agent and the IBM Integration Bus Monitoring Agent, both of which have enhancements in V7.5 that address monitoring requirements you may have. You can upgrade your OMEGAMON for Messaging monitoring components to V7.5 while using the previous release of MQ Configuration. \n\nWhether or not you want to continue using MQ Configuration when you install and configure OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5, there may be steps you need to take, so please review this document prior to installing and configuring V7.5. \n\nCONTENT\nFirst, please determine whether you have previously installed and configured the MQ Configuration component. If you have not done so previously, there is no need for you to consider the rest of this document. For this determination, please examine the following: \n\n\n\u00b7 SMP/E: Are the FMIDs for MQ Configuration installed? The FMIDs are HKMC730 and HKCF730, or HKMC710 and HKCF710 if you are using the V7.1 level. \n\u00b7 PARMGEN: In your PARMGEN configuration for each runtime environment, does the \u201cInclude Products in this PARMGEN RTE panel (KCIP@PGI)\u201d (under step \u201c1 KCIJPCFG Set-up/Refresh PARMGEN work environment\u201d navigation from the PARAMETER GENERATOR (PARMGEN) WORKFLOW - PRIMARY OPTION MENU), have the line for \u201cKMC OMEGAMON for Messaging \u2013 WebSphere MQ Configuration\u201d selected for configuration in the environment? \n\nIf the answers are \u201cyes\u201d to both of the above questions, then you do need to continue with the following general steps, which are documented in detail below: \n\n1) Determine whether there are any users of MQ Configuration in your environment. There are many cases in which the MQ Configuration component is installed and configured in PARMGEN, but no one is actually using it. It is important to determine this in order to decide which step to take next.\n\n2) If you do not have users of MQ Configuration, or you want to remove it anyway, there may be steps required when you are installing and configuring OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 especially if you previously configured a shared agent address space for MQ monitoring (KMQ) and MQ configuration (KMC) agents. \n\n3) If you do have users of MQ Configuration and want to continue supporting that usage, you need to follow recommendations when you are installing and configuring OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 upgraded products.\n\n\nHere are the details:\n\n1) Suggested ways to determine whether there are any users of MQ Configuration:\n\na. In the Tivoli Enterprise Portal (TEP), using an administrator user ID, click Edit->Administer Users to check whether any users or groups have access to the Configuration navigator view. For users and/or groups that have been configured for TEP, check the Navigator Views tab to see if any of them have \u201cConfiguration\u201d in their Assigned Views. If no one is allowed access to the Configuration navigator, then they are not using MQ Configuration feature. \n\nb. Another item to check in Administer Users is whether any user or group has the Permissions tab showing that View or Modify permission has been authorized for WebSphere MQ Configuration Authorities \u201cConfigure\u201d authority. Some user or group should have permission to use this feature if it is used by anyone. \n\nc. Check whether there are configured names that reflect queue managers in your environment. Click on the Configuration navigator in the view drop-down list in the Navigator pane, then click on Defined View on the left. In the middle Defined Tree pane on the workspace, expand the various \u201c+\u201d items, and with the help of someone who knows MQ queue managers in your environment, see if any of the expanded items reflect queue managers actually in your environment. There will be default and example items shipped with the product, but you are looking for names reflecting MQ at your site. If there are no names that reflect queue managers in your environment, then no one is using MQ Configuration.\n\nd. If it appears that there is usage of MQ Configuration, it would still be good to check with MQ users at your site to see if they actually require it. Perhaps they have experimented with it but do not actually use it regularly. If the OMEGAMON feature for MQ Configuration is not absolutely required in your environment, the recommendation would be to review all the ways that the IBM MQ product offers to configure and administer MQ, some of which are new in recent releases. Also, remember that the OMEGAMON MQ Monitoring agent offers the Take Action facility to issue any MQSC configuration command if the user is authorized.\n\n\n2) If there are no users of MQ Configuration, or you want to remove it anyway: \n\na. If you use a Serverpac that contains the upgraded OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 components to install, the MQ Configuration FMIDs (HKMC730 and HKCF730) are not installed because they are not included in the Serverpac. However, depending on your previous configuration, the missing MQ Configuration component could cause unexpected results in your LPAR runtime environment (RTE), so check and act on the following items prior to installation and configuration of OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5:\n\n1. If your Hub TEMS is configured on the z/OS platform and there are RKCF* DDNAME statements in your existing Hub TEMS started task JCL, update the TEMS started task JCL to remove those RKCF* DDNAME statements.\n\n2. If MQ Configuration (KMC) and MQ Monitoring (KMQ) agents are running in a shared agent address space, make sure that the owner of that address space is the MQ Monitoring agent. For the MQ Monitoring agent to be the owner, the related PARMGEN LPAR RTE profile parameters for OMEGAMON for Messaging components may need adjusting, as depicted in the following example before and after settings:\n\nBefore (MQ Configuration owns the Agent address space called OMEGMQ):\nISREDDE2 %RTE_PLIB_HILEV%.%RTE_NAME%.WCONFIG(%RTE_NAME%) \nCommand ===> \nKMC_AGT_STC OMEGMQ\nKMC_AGT_STC_OWNER \u201c\u201d\nKMQ_AGT_STC \u201c\u201d\nKMQ_AGT_STC_OWNER OMEGMQ\n\nAfter (MQ Monitoring owns the Agent address space called OMEGMQ): \nISREDDE2 %RTE_PLIB_HILEV%.%RTE_NAME%.WCONFIG(%RTE_NAME%) \nCommand ===>\nKMQ_AGT_STC OMEGMQ\nKMQ_AGT_STC_OWNER \u201c\u201d \n\nTip: Please review the SMPE06 upgrade scenario [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAUBV/com.ibm.omegamon_share.doc_6.3.0.2/parmgenref/smpe06_parmgenref.htm?pos=2] in the OMEGAMON Shared Knowledge Center as part of deploying these changes. You can use the refreshed OMEGMQ OMEGAMON for Messaging \u2013 KMQ Agent-only address space in the RTE\u2019s W/RKANSAMU dataset for refreshing the original shared address space in your system procedure library. The only delta would be the RKMCAPLA DDNAME, which can be staged for removal.\n\nb. If you install OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 as a CBPDO into an existing SMP/E CSI, the MQ Configuration FMIDs will remain installed, but since you are not using MQ Configuration, it is recommended you follow these steps:\n\n1. If MQ Configuration (KMC) and MQ Monitoring (KMQ) agents are running in a shared agent address space, make sure that the owner of that address space is the MQ Monitoring agent. See item a.2 above for more details.\n\n2. In the \u201cInclude Products in this PARMGEN RTE panel (KCIP@PGI)\u201d (under step \u201c1 KCIJPCFG Set-up/Refresh PARMGEN work environment\u201d navigation from the PARAMETER GENERATOR (PARMGEN) WORKFLOW - PRIMARY OPTION MENU), deselect the line with \u201cKMC OMEGAMON for Messaging \u2013 WebSphere MQ Configuration\u201d so that it will be removed from the runtime environment (RTE) during reconfiguration/upgrade of the RTE. Follow one of the SMPEnn upgrade scenarios [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAUBV/com.ibm.omegamon_share.doc_6.3.0.2/parmgenref/smpe04_parmgenref.htm?pos=2] documented in the OMEGAMON Shared Knowledge Center. \n\nTip: Prior to upgrading the RTE, you also have the option to SMP/E delete the HKMC730 and HKCF730 FMIDs from the existing CSI. When you start the PARMGEN configuration phase of the upgrade, the inexistence of these deleted FMIDs is PARMGEN\u2019s trigger to delete the product from the RTE upon reconfiguration following any of the SMPEnn upgrade scenarios (SMPE04 [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAUBV/com.ibm.omegamon_share.doc_6.3.0.2/parmgenref/smpe04_parmgenref.htm?pos=2], SMPE05 [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAUBV/com.ibm.omegamon_share.doc_6.3.0.2/parmgenref/smpe05_parmgenref.htm?pos=2] or SMPE06 [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAUBV/com.ibm.omegamon_share.doc_6.3.0.2/parmgenref/smpe06_parmgenref.htm?pos=2]). \n\n\n3) If there are users of MQ Configuration, and you want to continue supporting that usage: \n\na. It is highly recommended that you install OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 as a CBPDO into the existing SMP/E CSI so that MQ Configuration remains available. If you do this, there are no other steps required, however, the following step is also highly recommended: \n\n1. If MQ Configuration (KMC) and MQ Monitoring (KMQ) agents are running in a shared agent address space, separate them into their own address spaces, since they will be running at different product levels. For this, the related PARMGEN LPAR RTE profile parameters for OMEGAMON for Messaging components may need adjusting to be like the following example in which MQ Configuration is running in an address space called OMEGMC and MQ Monitoring is running in an address space called OMEGMQ:\n\nISREDDE2 %RTE_PLIB_HILEV%.%RTE_NAME%.WCONFIG(%RTE_NAME%) \nCommand ===> \nKMC_AGT_STC OMEGMC\nKMC_AGT_STC_OWNER \u201c\u201d\nKMQ_AGT_STC OMEGMQ\nKMQ_AGT_STC_OWNER \u201c\u201d\n\nb. If you were to install OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 in a Serverpac, you would need to retain your old SMP/E CSI and maintain a separate PARMGEN runtime environment in order to use MQ Configuration separately. This may be acceptable to you if you already separate MQ Configuration from the rest of your monitoring infrastructure, with its own Hub TEMS, etc. In this case, for the configuration that will contain OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5, please see item 2 above, steps a.1 and a.2 in case they would apply to that particular configuration.\n\nc.

Where are all the locations that this value is set and what are their precedence? ", "document": {"content": "WebSphere http session management time-out wasrun precedence overwrite TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n It is possible to set the HTTP Session time-out in various places on the IBM\u00ae WebSphere\u00ae Application Server Administrative Console. It is also possible to set HTTP Session time-out for the application packaging process. \n\nSince Session time-out can be set in multiple places, it is necessary to understand how the ultimate Session time-out for an application is determined. \n\nCAUSE\nApplication needs HTTP session time-out set.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe HTTP Session time-out can be set in the following places: \n\n * From the Administrative Console at the server, Enterprise application, and Web application levels \n * At the time when the application is packaged \n * In the application code\n\n\nSetting the HTTP Session time-out from the Administrative Console \n1. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the server level, navigate to Servers > Application Servers > Your Server > Web Container > Session Management. \n\nIn the Session time-out section of this window, you can select No time-out or Set time-out by clicking the appropriate radio button. If you choose to set the time-out, type the desired value in minutes in the box. \n\n\n2. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Enterprise Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Session Management. \n\nCheck Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the application session to overwrite those values set at the parent, which in this case is the Server level. \n\n\n3. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Web Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Web Module > Your Web App.war > Session Management. \n\nCheck Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the Application Session to overwrite those values set at the parent levels, which in this case is the Server or Enterprise Application level. \n\nAfter modifying these settings, save the master configuration. \n\nSetting HTTP Session time-out when application is packaged \n\nThe application developer can also select to set the HTTP Session time-out parameter when the application is packaged. This value is stored in the web.xml file for the Web application. \n\nThis setting overrides any session time-outs defined from the Administrative Console. Alter this setting by repackaging the application with a new value, or by modifying the web.xml file. The entry in the web.xml will be as follows: \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<session-config> \n      * \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<session-timeout>60</session-timeout>\n * \n * \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </session-config>\n\n \n\nWhere the \"session-timeout\" is an integer value for the desired session time-out in minutes. \nSetting HTTP Session time-out from the application code \n\nFinally, the HTTP Session time-out can be set in the application code. The programmer can invoke the setMaxInactiveInterval() method on HttpSession object to set the time-out value as desired. This setting overrides any time-out defined in the application package or made from the Administrative Console. \n\nHTTP Session time-out Override Precedence Summary \n\nThe list below shows the precedence from which the final HTTP Session time-out is derived. \n\n1.

To see why the messaging engines were not available, check the SystemOut.log for applicable messages. Examine the SystemOut.log file starting at the time period when the application experienced the problem and search backward. \n\n\nCheck for the CWSID0016I which indicates status of the Messaging Engine activity. You may see messages like this:\n\nSibMessage I [:] CWSID0016I: Messaging engine [mename]is in state Stopping.\nSibMessage I [:] CWSID0016I: Messaging engine [mename]is in state Stopped.\n\nThe solution for this problem is to start the messaging engine.\n\nIf the messaging engine is running and you still see these errors at the application side, other possible reasons for this problem are:\n\n1) Check provider end points. The value for the provider endpoints should be in the format of host_name:port_number:BootstrapBasicMessaging.\n\nIn the JMS connection factory, you can define a list of provider endpoints that govern which servers the application will attempt to connect to. If you have defined these endpoints, ensure that the messaging engines for these servers have all started and that the port and transport chains defined in the endpoint list are correct. Also, ensure that the values for the Connection proximity (bus, cluster, host or server) and the Target groups and Target significance settings are appropriate. For example, if the Target significance value is Required and no suitable messaging engine could be located, then this would cause a connection failure. Please refer to the following links for how to set provider endpoints:\n\nDefault messaging provider queue connection factory [Settings] : [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/SIBJMSQueueConnectionFactory_DetailForm.html]\n\nDefault messaging provider topic connection factory [Settings]: [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/SIBJMSTopicConnectionFactory_DetailForm.html]\n\nRestart the server after making the change.\n\n2) If your environment is heavily loaded, the HA manager might not be able to locate the running messaging engine within three seconds. In this case, check if there are any hung threads in the SystemOut.log, and resolve them if possible. Next, consider increasing the value of sib.trm.linger from three to give the HA manager more time to locate a messaging engine.\n\nTune the sib.trm.linger property value in the sib.properties file to set the messaging engine lookup delay so that the Work Load Manager (WLM) waits for a longer period of time before returning an error. Please refer to information below on how to set this property in the sib.properties. \n\n1)<WAS_HOME>/properties : The properties declared under this location would be applicable to all the profiles in that installation.\n\n2)<PROFILE_ROOT>/properties : The properties declared here are applicable for all the servers on this profile\n\nIf a property is defined at both <PROFILE_ROOT>/properties and <WAS_HOME>/properties, then the property defined at <PROFILE_ROOT>/properties would take precedence.\n\nAfter resetting the property you must restart the server.\n\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration WebSphere MQ Not Applicable Business Integration WebSphere Process Server Business Integration WebSphere Service Registry and Repository Business Integration IBM Business Process Manager Standard Business Integration WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus Business Integration WebSphere Partner Gateway Advanced Edition Configuration Business Integration WebSphere MQ Configuration \nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n WebSphere Application Server WAS SIB SIBUS SI BUS", "content_type": "text", "id": "swg21624731"}, "is_correct_answer": true, "is_correct_document": true, "origin": "gold-label", "answer": {"answer": "If your environment is heavily loaded, the HA manager might not be able to locate the running messaging engine within three seconds.

The Combined Cumulative Fix is a package of WebSphere Portal fixes and Web Content Manager Cumulative fixes. \n\nWhat's New \n\nAs of WebSphere Portal V7.0.0.2 Combined Cumulative Fix 26 (CF26), support has been added for syndicating to subscribers running WebSphere Portal V8.0.0.1 Combined Cumulative Fix 09 (CF09) or later. \n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpace requirements \n\nEnsure that enough disk space is available in the following directories: \n\nz/OS: 625 cylinders in the directory where you download the cumulative fix, 625 cylinders in the <Portal Configuration HFS>, 625 cylinders in <WebSphere Configuration HFS> and 1250 cylinders in your system temp directory. \n\nAll other platforms: 2 GB in the directory where you download the cumulative fix, 1 GB in <Portal_Install_Root>, 1 GB in <wp_profile_root> temporary disk space and 1 GB in your system temp directory, such as /tmp on Unix or Linux platforms or C:\\temp on the Microsoft Windows platform. \n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteps for installing Combined Cumulative Fix \n\nBEFORE YOU BEGIN:\nFamiliarize yourself with the Portal Upgrade Best Practices available from IBM Remote Technical Support for WebSphere Portal.\n\nPortal Upgrades: Best Practices for V7.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21452611] For instructions on how to validate your environment prior to the upgrade, see the instructions for running the Health Checker tool for WebSphere Portal at:\n\nHealth Checker tool for WebSphere Portal V7.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27020200] IMPORTANT: Certain security configurations can cause failures with the upgrade. Please check the following technote to see if this may apply to your environment.\n\nFix Pack 7.0.0.1 fails at action-import-defaultnodes-wp.filestore/base task. [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21496067] \n 1. Perform the following steps before installing Combined Cumulative fix:\n     1. Before you install this combined cumulative fix, check to see if the list of fixes already installed on your system is included in the list of fixes provided in this combined cumulative fix. If you have temporary, interim or cumulative fixes on your system that are not included in this Combined Cumulative Fix, then uninstall those fixes before installing this Combined Cumulative Fix and contact IBM Support for an updated version of that fix, or for more information. \n     2. If you are running an external Web server such as IBM HTTP server, stop the Web server. \n     3. Verify that the information in the wkplc.properties, wkplc_dbdomain.properties, wkplc_dbtype.properties, and wkplc_comp.properties files are correct. WebSphere Portal 7 introduced support for multiple profiles. If using multiple profiles, also verify that the information in each profile is correct. See the following link for multiple profiles Supporting multiple profiles: wp7 [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Supporting_multiple_profiles_wp7].  * Enter a value for the PortalAdminPwd and WasPassword parameters in the wkplc.properties file. \n         * Ensure that the DbUser (database user) and DbPassword (database password) parameters are defined correctly for all database domains in the wkplc_dbdomain.properties file. \n         * Unix/Linux/Windows/IBM i Only: The WebSphere Portal Update Installer removes plain text passwords from the wkplc*.properties files. To keep these passwords in the properties files, include the following line in the wkplc.properties file: PWordDelete=false. \n         * Ensure that the value of the XmlAccessPort property in wkplc_comp.properties matches the value of the port used for HTTP connections to the WebSphere Portal server. \n        \n        \n     4. Special considerations for multiple profiles or binary install or migration upgrade:  1. If you did a binary installation and created a WebSphere Portal profile later, or your Portal 7.0.0.x was migrated from 6.1.x, ensure that the PortalServer/wps.properties file correctly references the profile. The Portal Update Installer uses the wps.properties file to determine which profile is the primary profile to update. Failure to complete this step could result in an inoperable Portal server after the Combined Cumulative Fix installation completes.  1. Edit the <PortalServer root>/wps.properties file in a text editor \n             2. Add these two properties if they do not already exist:\n                ProfileName=<your profile name, e.g. wp_profile>\n                ProfileDirectory=<your profile directory, e.g. /opt/IBM/WebSphere/wp_profile>\n                \n                Note: The ProfileDirectory property should use forward slash (/) instead of backslash (\\) on Windows.\n            \n            \n         2. If you have created multiple profiles. the Portal Update Installer will automatically upgrade all profiles. If you want to specify which profiles are updated, then complete the following steps:  1. Edit the <PortalServer root>/wps.properties file in a text editor \n             2. Add this property if it does not already exist:\n                AutoUpdateMultipleProfiles=<comma separated list of profile names, e.g. wp_profile, wp_profile2, wp_profile3>\n            \n            \n         3. If using Multiple Profiles, verify all your profiles are at the same level before starting upgrade.\n            \n        \n        \n     5. Perform the following steps to download the Combined Cumulative Fix and the WebSphere Portal Update Installer:  1. Download the latest Combined Cumulative fix (e.g. 7.0.0.2-WP-WCM-Combined-CFPMnnnnn-CFnnn), and the latest WebSphere Portal Update Installer from http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24027857 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24027857]. \n         2. Create the PortalServer_root/update directory and extract the WebSphere Portal Update Installer file into this directory. \n         3. Create the PortalServer_root/update/fixes directory and extract the 7.0.0.2-WP-WCM-Combined-CFPMnnnnn-CFnnn.zip file into this directory, where n is the numbers associated with the version of the Combined Cumulative fix. Note for z/OS users: refer to Installing interim fixes on WebSphere Portal Enable for z/OS using Portal Update Installer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21326670] for detailed descriptions of how to execute steps ii. and iii. above. \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n2. Choose either the graphical user interface installation option or the command line installation option: \n\nNOTE: Not all platforms can use the graphical user interface (IBM i and z/OS can only use command line). \n\nNOTE: If the installation fails, use the IBM Support Assistant [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/isa/] to access support-related information and serviceability tools for problem determination. For IBM i, download ISA on a system other than IBM i. On the Support Assistant Welcome page, click Service. Then click the Create Portable Collector link to create a remotely collect the data from your IBM i system. Fix what is causing the problem and then rerun the installation task. \n\n\nIf using the Universal PUI, (which does not include the bundled Java environment), run the following command, setupCmdLine.bat for Windows or . ./setupCmdLine.sh for Unix/Linux from the was_profile_root/bin directory to set up the Java environment for the graphical user interface installation program. When updating a Portal that does not have a profile because it was installed with isBinaryInstall=\"true\", then run setupCmdLine.bat|.sh from PortalServer_root/bin. z/OS users can not use the Universal PUI. \n\nEnter the following command to launch the graphical user interface installation program:  *  Windows: PortalServer_root\\update> updatePortalWizard.bat Unix/Linux: PortalServer_root/update> ./updatePortalWizard.sh\n   \n   - OR -\n   Perform the following steps to launch the installation program from the command line:  1. Stop any active application servers using the stopServer command. To see which application servers are active use the serverStatus command. \n    2. Enter the following command to launch the installation program (NOTE: Enter the command on one line):\n   \n    * Windows: PortalServer_root\\update> updatePortal.bat -install\n      -installDir \"<PortalServer_root>\"\n      -fix\n      -fixDir \"<PortalServer_root>\\update\\fixes\"\n      -fixes < Cumulative fix > \n    * Unix/Linux: PortalServer_root/update> ./updatePortal.sh -install\n      -installDir \"<PortalServer_root>\"\n      -fix\n      -fixDir \"<PortalServer_root>/update/fixes\"\n      -fixes < Cumulative fix > \n    * IBM i: portal_server_root/update> updatePortal.sh -install\n      -installDir \"<portal_server_root>\"\n      -fix\n      -fixDir \"<portal_server_root>/update/fixes\"\n      -fixes < Cumulative fix > \n    * z/OS: If the Health Checker Tool for WebSphere Portal V7.0 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27020200] has not been run then it needs to be run before installing the Combined Cumulative Fix. Execute the following commands to install the Combined Cumulative Fix:  1. From <was_profile_root>/bin directory:\n          . ./setupCmdLine.sh \n       2. PortalServer_root/update> ./updatePortal.sh -install\n          -installDir \"<PortalServer_root>\"\n          -fix\n          -fixDir \"<PortalServer_root>/update/fixes\"\n          -fixes <Cumulative fix>\n          \n          Alternatively, the steps i. and ii. above can be executed via JCL. Customize the JCL samples from the following link: Installing interim fixes on WebSphere Portal Enable for z/OS using Portal Update Installer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21326670]. Submit the JCLs, and then return here to continue.\n          \n      \n      \n   \n   If you do not have any profiles at this point (because you are in the process of migration from WebSphere Portal 6.1 or Installing an additional node for a cluster or creating multiple profiles) no post installation steps are necessary and you can continue with the next steps that create the profiles as outlined by the according documentation.\n   \n   z/OS: If doing an upgrade as part of a migration from a previous version (eg. 6.x), run ./ConfigEngine.sh gather-migration-files command from the <wp_profile_root>/ConfigEngine directory.\n   \n   z/OS: Run the following command: <wp_profile_root>/PortalServer/bin/UpdateProfile.sh install CF skipPreCheckProfile\n   \n   All other platforms: To update a profile after an upgrade, the following command can be used to update profiles that are not included in AutoUpdateMultipleProfiles. All profiles that were not included in AutoUpdateMultipleProfiles need to be updated after the upgrade is done. All profiles must be at the same level for future upgrades to be applied. See the following link for multiple profiles Supporting multiple profiles: wp7 [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Supporting_multiple_profiles_wp7].\n   \n   <wp_profile_root>/PortalServer/bin/UpdateProfile.bat|.sh install CF\n   \n   This cumulative fix provides updates to OSGi bundles. After installing the cumulative fix, run \"<profile location>/bin/osgiCfgInit.sh\" (for IBM i the command is just osgiCfgInit, for Microsoft Windows the command is osgiCfgInit.bat) to clear the caches and make the OSGi container pick up the updates to the modified OSGi bundles. Note that it is recommended to stop the portal server before running the osgiCfgInit command. \n * \n * \n\n3. Perform the following post installation steps: \n *  If you are running an external Web server such as IBM HTTP server and you are using the WebSphere Application Server automatic generation and propagation of the plugin, then just restart the Web server. If you are not using the automatic generation and propagation, then perform the following steps:\n    1. Regenerate the Web server plugin. \n    2. Copy the plugin-cfg.xml file to the Plugin directory. \n    3. Restart the Web server.\n       \n   \n   Redeploy your customization, including JSPs, to the WCM portlets if you are using Web Content Manager and you customized the portlets prior to installing the Combined Cumulative fix.  1. To update the deployed remote rendering portlet:  * Backup any files (e.g. custom JSPs) which have been copied to the deployed remote rendering portlet WAR directory \n        * Log in to Portal as the Portal Administrator \n        * Navigate to: Administration / Portlet Management / Web Modules \n        * Find and select the remote rendering portlet web module \n        * Click the Update Portlet Icon to the right of the selected portlet \n        * Select the updated portlet WAR file located in: <PortalServer_root>/PortalServer/wcm/prereq.wcm/installableApps \n        * Click Next and Finish\n       \n       \n    2. To update the deployed PDM Doc List Portlet:  * Backup any files (e.g. custom JSPs) which have been copied to the deployed remote rendering portlet WAR directory \n        * Log in to Portal as the Portal Administrator \n        * Navigate to: Administration / Portlet Management / Web Modules \n        * Find and select the PDM Doc List Portlet web module \n        * Click the Update Portlet Icon to the right of the selected portlet \n        * Select the updated portlet WAR file located in: <PortalServer_root>/PortalServer/wcm/prereq.wcm/installableApps \n        * Click Next and Finish\n       \n       \n    3. Log out of Portal for changes to take effect.\n   \n   Clear the browser cache before using the updated Web Content Manager. Review the following documentation \"Configuration Changes and Options introduced in WP/WCM V7.0.0.1 and 7.0.0.2 Combined Cumulative Fixes\" [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27021250] to see if it applies to your environment.\n   \n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteps for uninstalling Combined Cumulative Fix \n\nNOTE: Changing the server context root after upgrading is an unsupported uninstall path. To uninstall after changing the context root, you must first change the server context root back to the values of the previous version. \n\nNOTE: Configuring Portal Server from a stand-alone environment to a cluster environment after upgrading is an unsupported uninstall path. \n\n 1. Perform the following steps before you uninstall the Combined Cumulative Fix:  1. If you are running an external Web server such as IBM HTTP server, stop the Web server. \n     2. Verify that the information in the wkplc.properties, wkplc_dbdomain.properties, wkplc_dbtype.properties, and wkplc_comp.properties files are correct. If using multiple profiles, also verify that the information in each profile is correct. See the following link for multiple profiles Supporting multiple profiles: wp7 [http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Supporting_multiple_profiles_wp7].  * Enter a value for the PortalAdminPwd and WasPassword parameters in the wkplc.properties file. \n         * Ensure that the DbUser (database user) and DbPassword (database password) parameters are defined correctly for all database domains in the wkplc_dbdomain.properties file. \n         * If using a database other than the default, grant permissions to databases within the framework by setting the DbUser (database user) and DbPassword (database password) parameters in the wkplc_dbdomain.properties file. \n         * Unix/Linux/Windows/IBM i Only: The WebSphere Portal Update Installer removes plain text passwords from the wkplc*.properties files. To keep these passwords in the properties files, include the following line in the wkplc.properties file: PWordDelete=false. \n         * Ensure that the value of the XmlAccessPort property in wkplc_comp.properties matches the value of the port used for HTTP connections to the WebSphere Portal server. \n         * WebSphere Portal 7 introduced support for multiple profiles. During the Combined Cumulative Fix uninstall the primary profile is downgraded first if one exists (The Update Installer also supports the update case for a binary only install without profiles). The primary profile is identified by two properties, ProfileDirectory and ProfileName. Ensure these properties are set before starting the downgrade process. \n         * If using Multiple Profiles, verify all your profiles are at the same level before starting downgrade.\n           \n        \n        \n    \n    \n 2. Choose either the graphical user interface uninstallation option or the command line uninstallation option:\n    \n    NOTE: Not all platforms can use the graphical user interface (IBM i and z/OS can only use command line).\n    \n    NOTE: If the uninstallation fails, use the IBM Support Assistant [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/isa/] to access support-related information and serviceability tools for problem determination.

If you are running an external Web server such as IBM HTTP server and you are using the WebSphere Application Server automatic generation and propagation of the plugin, then just restart the Web server. If you are not using the automatic generation and propagation, then perform the following steps:  1. Regenerate the Web server plugin. \n     2. Copy the plugin-cfg.xml file to the Plugin directory. \n     3. Restart the Web server.\n    \n    \n 5. If you previously customized any configuration files in the wp_profile_root/PortalServer/config directory, check to see if uninstalling the cumulative fix affected those files by restoring a version of the files that was saved when the cumulative fix was originally installed. If it did affect the files, you must perform the same customization on the restored version of each file. \n 6. Redeploy your customization, including JSPs, to the WCM portlets if you are using Web Content Manager and you customized the portlets prior to uninstalling the Combined Cumulative fix.  1. To update the deployed remote rendering portlet:  * Backup any files (e.g. custom JSPs) which have been copied to the deployed remote rendering portlet WAR directory \n         * Log in to Portal as the Portal Administrator \n         * Navigate to: Administration / Portlet Management / Web Modules \n         * Find and select the remote rendering portlet web module \n         * Click the Update Portlet Icon to the right of the selected portlet \n         * Select the updated portlet WAR file located in: <PortalServer_root>/PortalServer/wcm/prereq.wcm/installableApps \n         * Click Next and Finish\n        \n        \n     2. To update the deployed PDM Doc List Portlet:  * Backup any files (e.g. custom JSPs) which have been copied to the deployed remote rendering portlet WAR directory \n         * Log in to Portal as the Portal Administrator \n         * Navigate to: Administration / Portlet Management / Web Modules \n         * Find and select the PDM Doc List Portlet web module \n         * Click the Update Portlet Icon to the right of the selected portlet \n         * Select the updated portlet WAR file located in: <PortalServer_root>/PortalServer/wcm/prereq.wcm/installableApps \n         * Click Next and Finish\n        \n        \n     3. Log out of Portal for changes to take effect.\n    \n    \n 7. Clear the browser cache before using the updated Web Content Manager.\n\n\n\n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown issues for latest Combined Cumulative Fix \n\n\nProblem: There may be browser / functional issues in themes and in WCM when running 7002 CF levels against Internet Explorer 11 or Microsoft Edge. \nSolution: It is recommended to run these browsers in compatibility mode as necessary. Also, note that some pieces of WCM functionality (exs. inability to close Workflow dialogs, Applet issues) may not work correctly with these browsers even in compatibility mode as they are not supported. \n\nProblem: Inline help may not appear correctly after CF29 update on zOS. \nSolution: From the <wp_profile_root>/ConfigEngine directory, run task \n\n./ConfigEngine.sh expand-ear-wp.iehs.ear \n\nThen restart the Portal server. \n\n\nProblem: When using versions earlier than 'Java 6 update 45' or 'Java 7 update 51', a security pop-up dialog or error will be seen every time the WCM FileTransferApplet or Ephox EditLive editor is instantiated. \nSolution: It is recommended to upgrade the Java runtime environment level to either 'Java 6 update 45' or 'Java 7 update 51' or later. Please refer to the following URL: swg21663838 \n\n\nProblem: After you enter a number into the number element/component, and then save the content/component more than twice, you will notice that the number field gets populated with some dots, i.e. 123.456.78. If you then click on Save again, you will get the following error: \n'Enter a valid number. ( content/component name here)' \nSolution: The workaround is to remove the dots and save again. \n\n\nProblem: Page theme is changed to current Portal default theme when changing page content layout. \nSolution: The workaround would be to change the page theme back to \"Inherit Parent Theme\". A fix for this issue is scheduled to be included in a future Combined CF. \n\n\nProblem: After upgrading to a 7.0.0.2 Cumulative Fix and \"Portal 7.0.0.2\" theme has been set as the default portal theme, a user is unable to post to a blog or update a wiki using Microsoft Windows Internet Explorer. \nSolution: Perform the following steps to resolve the issue:  1. Navigate to Administration -> Manage Pages -> Contenet_Root -> Hidden pages. \n 2. Select \"Edit Page Properties\" for the hidden page named 'Web Content Management'. \n 3. On the 'Edit page: Web Content Management' page, extend 'Theme:' drop-down list and select \"-----Inherit Parent Theme-----\".\n\n\n\nProblem: WCM Authoring Search may not work after an upgrade to a 7.0.0.2 Cumulative Fix \nSolution: Perform the following steps to resolve the issue:  1. Edit the <wp_profile>/PortalServer/jcr/lib/com/ibm/icm/icm.properties file in a text editor to verify all properties are correct. \n 2. Set jcr.textsearch.enabled=true \n 3. Change jcr.textsearch.indexdirectory to a corresponding location in the filesystem \n 4. Restart your Portal Server. \n 5. Create a new library or make changes in existing libraries\n\n\n\nProblem: When configuring Portal for use with a remote DB2 on z/OS database, the sample job provided for the database creation does not contain the statements required to create the storage groups. These take the form: \n\nCREATE STOGROUP group \nVOLUMES(' volume') \nVCAT category; \nCOMMIT; \n\nwhere, \ngroup is the name of the storage group for the database, \nvolume is the volume serial number of * to let SMS select the volume where the database will reside, \ncategory is the category name of the Integrated Catalog Facility. \n\nSolution: When using the EJPSCRDB sample job add the above statements for each storage group to the final version. These should be added at the beginning of \"Step 2\" of the sample job, just before the CREATE statements for the actual databases. \n\n\nProblem: Theme Policies are not supported by the Portal 7.0.0.2 theme. \nSolution: This is a known limitation. \n\n\nProblem: Client-side aggregation is not supported by the Portal 7.0.0.2 theme. \nSolution: This is a known limitation. \n\n\nProblem: The WebSphere Portal 7.0.0.2 theme does not support Sametime 8.5.1 \nSolution: This is a known limitation. \n\n\nProblem: Loading a page with the out of box default profile (Deferred) causes \"dojo is not defined\" error. \nSolution: Dojo is not available in view mode using the Deferred profile, which is the default out of box. Switch the page or theme to use the Full profile to access Dojo in view mode. For more information see URL: http://www.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Creating_the_module_profile_sdoc [http://www.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Creating_the_module_profile_sdoc] \n\n\nProblem: The Portal 7.0.0.2 drag-and-drop framework does not support multi-selection and copying resources. \nSolution: This is a known limitation. This can be enabled by creating a custom drag and drop source and enabling these features. \n\n\nProblem: The deploy-7002-theme task fails \nSolution: The Portal 7.0.0.2 theme requires several artifacts from the \"Page Builder\" theme to exist on the server. If you have removed the theme or if you are coming from a migrated environment where the theme never existed, you will need to add the Page Builder theme back to the system before running the deploy-7002-theme task. Please see the \"Additional instructions for a migrated environment\" section at the following URL for more information http://www.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Installing_a_new_theme_sdoc [http://www.lotus.com/ldd/portalwiki.nsf/dx/Installing_a_new_theme_sdoc] \n\n\nProblem: The Feedspace portlet in Portal 7.0.0.2 may show JavaScript issues. \nSolution: The Feedspace portlet needs to be redeployed to resolve this. Use the Portal administration area to update the the SyndicatedFeedPortlet.war. Use the PortalServer/bp/wp.bp.feedspace/installableApps/SyndicatedFeedPortlet.war to do this update. \n\n\nProblem: If a WCM cumulative fix is installed on a Websphere Portal 7.0.0.2 where the date of the install is later than the date on which the cumulative fix was packaged, then the update-wcm task will fail to overwrite the WCM war files from the base version. \nSolution: To workaround this problem, the war files from [PortalServer]\\wcm\\prereq.wcm\\installableApps have to be manually copied to [PortalServer]\\installableApps. Once this is done, the update-wcm task will execute successfully. \n\n\nProblem: Newly added WCM libraries might not be listed in the \"Web Content Libraries\" portlet on all nodes of the cluster due to an issue in cache replication. \nSolution: The workaround would be to restart nodes which have the stale library list. A fix for this issue is scheduled to be included in a future Combined CF. \n\n\nProblem: After uninstall of the combined cumulative fix, WPVersionInfo shows IBM WebSphere Portal Configuration Framework (CFGFW) at the upgraded version level. \nSolution: This is expected. The CFGFW version level shown after the uninstall of the combined cumulative fix remains at the upgraded level. There is no functional problem. \n\n\nProblem: If you plan to configure Computer Associates eTrust SiteMinder as your external security manager to handle authorization and authentication, the XML configuration interface may not be able to access WebSphere Portal through eTrust SiteMinder. \nSolution: To enable the XML configuration interface to access WebSphere Portal, use eTrust SiteMinder to define the configuration URL (/wps/config) as unprotected. Refer to the eTrust SiteMinder documentation for specific instructions. After the configuration URL is defined as unprotected, only WebSphere Portal enforces access control to this URL. Other resources such as the /wps/myportal URL are still protected by eTrust SiteMinder. If you already set up eTrust SiteMinder for external authorization and you want to use XMLConfiguration Interface (xmlaccess), make sure you have followed the procedure to allow for xmlaccess execution. \n\n\nProblem: If using the Firefox browser, portlets cannot be dragged to a page from the palette. It is necessary to click the + icon next to the portlet in the palette to add it to the page. \nSolution: This is documented as a known limitation. \n\n\nProblem: If an error is seen starting server \"WebSphere_Portal\" during the upgrade, a possible cause is that this server start is automatically enabled as part of the node reset state. \nThe error would appear similar to the following as part of the \"action-start-portal-server-standard\" task : \"ADMU3027E: An instance of the server may already be running: WebSphere_Portal\" \nSolution: Log into the WAS Admin Console. Under Application Servers-> WebSphere_Portal, ensure that the Monitoring Policy for \"Node restart state\" is set to Stopped for all WebSphere Portal servers that are part of the environment. \n\n\nFor a list of known issues for Previous WebSphere Portal 7.0.0.2 Combined Cumulative Fixes, see IBM WebSphere Portal 7.0.0.2 Combined Cumulative Fix Previous Known Issues [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023912]for details. \n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional information \nYou can find additional information on the WebSphere Portal support page [http://www-306.ibm.com/software/genservers/portal/support/]. \n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrademarks and service marks \nFor trademark attribution, visit the IBM Terms of Use [http://www.ibm.com/legal/us/] Web site. \n\nBack to top", "content_type": "text", "id": "swg27023910"}, "is_correct_answer": true, "is_correct_document": true, "origin": "gold-label", "answer": {"answer": "To update a profile after an upgrade, the following command can be used to update profiles that are not included in AutoUpdateMultipleProfiles.

By resolving the memory constraints, the stack overflow can be resolved. \nCAUSE\nWhen a stack overflow occurs, the amount of stack space required by the program exceeds what is configured for the stack in the Java\u2122 Virtual Machine (JVM) process, or the native stack size configured by the operating system. \nSome applications require stacks that are larger than the default size; for example, a graphics-intensive Java program can require a larger stack, which may require an increase in the stack size to avoid StackOverflow.\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nLook for either Out of Memory messages or java.lang.StackOverflow in the server logs. The process may continue to run after either of these messages are seen. \n\n\nIf a crash did occur, a javacore should have generated on IBM SDK. You will either see the signal as SIGSEGV, SIGILL, SIGABRT, or SIGBUS. Usually the current thread will indicate the following\n\n\n\n\npending=java.lang.StackOverflowError \nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n \n\n\n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21162896&aid=1]Explanations and Solutions\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21162896&amp;aid=2]Detailed Configuration Options \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nExplanations and Solutions \n\nInfinite Recursion \nIf an application is performing recursion, the maximum stack size can easily be reached and a Stack Overflow exception is thrown. The thread stack has a limited size and eventually its space will run out as the thread stack grows without bounds. \n\nSome traits of recursion: \n- Large thread stacks that appear to repeat \n- An infinite loop that continuously spawns off threads \n- Very large XML documents loaded into the Document Object Model (DOM) \n- JSP or servlets calling itself (usually by executing forward or include to itself) \n- Repeated calls in native functions \n\nIncreasing the thread stack size allows for larger thread stacks. However if the recursion continues to trigger a stack overflow, the next step is to identify what code is causing the recursion from javacores, thread dumps, or even system core files. \n\nA thread stack that indicates it's too large to display can be an indicator of stack overflow. This is especially true if the stack appears to repeat (such as recursive method calls). \n\nJIT/HotSpot Compiled Code \n\nThe JIT/HotSpot compiler (JIT) is designed to speed up the JVM execution times by compiling method calls. This can speed up execution time, but as more aggressive optimizations are used, this can inadvertently cause recursion, resulting in stack overflow or crash. The documents linked below explain how to debug JIT and HotSpot compiler issues:  * JIT Problem Determination for IBM SDK 5.0 and 6.0 using -Xjit [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21294023] \n * Debugging HotSpot failures on the Solaris and HP-UX operating environment [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21081179]\n\n\n\nDepleted Native Stack \nIt is almost guaranteed that a crash will occur if the native stack runs out of space. System cores can be used to identify long and possibly recursively looping native thread stacks. \n\nTo resolve, increase the native stack size (usually by adjusting the operating system limit for stack size) to accommodate the recursive native calls; however, identifying the recursive native calls will help determine the root cause of the stack overflow. \n\n\n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21162896&amp;aid=3] Back to top \n\n[http://www.ibm.com/i/v14/rules/dotted_blue_rule_443.gif] \n\n \n\nDetailed Configuration Options \n\nAdjusting the Stack Sizes (Xss and Xmso) options \nIf this does not work, you can adjust the stack sizes. Doubling the stack size is suggested as a first step; however, every thread that the JVM creates will consume memory.

This error almost always means that the policy did not receive any data. If you increase the logging from error to debug, you should see network failures surrounding the response header error.\n\n\n\nIn almost every event, this error is caused by a connection failure.\nThe error is correct, the service did not receive any response headers or data. The key to help confirm this is to increase the log level to debug. This will allow you to see the network debug errors around the context of the service error.\n\n\nANSWER\nThe classic causes of this are either of these two: \n\n\n\n \n\nA slow response that causes the connection to timeout before receiving the response\nA failed connection attempt due to a closed persistent connection or some other connection issue that prevents the WebSphere\u00ae DataPower device\u00ae from connecting to the backend. For example, a reused connection would be attempted and found to already be closed out by something outside of DataPower\u00ae.\nAn example of this is explained here:\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417934&wv=1 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417934&wv=1]\n\nThere are a broad range of network errors that can trigger this to error. A packet trace is the key to capture the problem and confirm what type of failure is the cause. A log with event subscription of \"all\" \"debug\" will also help correlate and confirm the packet trace data.\n\nIn some cases, a simple work around to try is to lower the DataPower persistent timeout or disable persistent connections.

It supports multi-cloud deployment and is available in Docker container, Linux application, VMware virtual machine and physical appliance form factors.\n\nIBM provides flexible support options to meet the needs of your business and minimize any business impact. The IBM DataPower Gateways end-of-service support policy applies differently between hardware and firmware.\n\nHardware \n\nDataPower physical appliance hardware is supported for a minimum of five years, starting at the General Availability of the new product. Beginning with the 8436 models, standard appliance service and support is available for five years from the end-of-marketing (EOM) date as described in the IBM Appliance Support Handbook [http://www.ibm.com/support/customercare/sas/f/applhandbook/home.html].\n\nFor end-of-service information on physical appliances, see IBM DataPower Gateways End of Service dates [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21317845]. \n\nFirmware \n\nBusinesses are building modernized digital platforms to drive innovation and disruption within the industry. IBM DataPower Gateways are a core component in these platforms and it needs to deliver new business functionality to keep pace with business innovation.\n\nEffective with DataPower Gateway firmware V7.6 [https://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=AN&subtype=CA&htmlfid=897/ENUS217-265&appname=USN], DataPower introduces a Continuous Delivery (CD) model to accelerate delivery of new capabilities and meet market needs. DataPower CD will consist of two releases:\n\n 1. CD release approximately once per quarter  * Only the most recent CD release is supported at a given time.\n    \n    \n 2. Long Term Support (LTS) release every 12 months.  * LTS releases are for customer seeking enhanced stability and do not wish to upgrade on the CD schedule, while CD releases are intended for customers seeking the latest features.\n     * The first LTS release post 7.6 GA will be within two years. Subsequent LTS releases will occur every 12 months.\n     * LTS releases will be supported for a minimum of 2 years.\n    \n    \n\nFirmware V7.6 and later have no extended support plan available for any release of DataPower Gateway. IBM will publish a notice of support discontinuance (end-of-service) for a LTS releases at least 12 months before the effective date.\n\nFirmware V7.5 and earlier will remain on the traditional IBM DataPower Gateway support model where they will be supported for a minimum of 2 years. There is no extended support plan available for any of these releases. IBM will publish a notice of support discontinuance (end-of-service) for releases at least 12 months before the effective date.\n\nNote: IBM DataPower Gateways customers can use the following table to track how long their version and release of a particular firmware level will be supported.

The precise directory location will depend of the version of Plug-in, and on the bit depth being used (32-bit or 64-bit). \n\n \n\nFor example..... \n\nIf you installed the 32-bit Plug-in v7.0 and are using with a 32-bit Apache 2.2, use this: \n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/gsk7/lib/ \n\n \n\nIf you installed the 64-bit Plug-in v7.0 and are using it with a 32-bit Apache 2.2, use this: \n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/gsk7/gsk7_32/lib/ \n\n \n\nIf you installed the 64-bit Plug-in v7.0 and are using it with a 64-bit Apache 2.2, use this: \n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/gsk7/gsk7_64/lib64/ \n\n \n\nIf you installed the 32-bit Plug-in v8.x and are using with a 32-bit Apache 2.2, use this: \n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/gsk8/lib/ \n\n \n\nIf you installed the 64-bit Plug-in v8.x and are using it with a 32-bit Apache 2.2, use this: \n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/gsk8/gsk8_32/lib/ \n\n \n\nIf you installed the 64-bit Plug-in v8.x and are using it with a 64-bit Apache 2.2, use this: \n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins/gsk8/gsk8_64/lib64/ \n\n \n\n \n\nPlease note that for Apache 2.2 on Linux, simply setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable from the command line prior to starting the web server, MAY NOT WORK.

", "document": {"content": "wid; noclassdeffounderror; java; jar TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n The visual snippet editor allows you to search and find methods in classes available only on a restricted basis at runtime. A runtime exception occurs when the Java\u2122 snippet calls a method in a class found in one of the plugin JARs in the server's plugins directory. \n\nCAUSE\nSome of the Java methods found in the JARs in the server's plugin directory are available to be called, but some of them are considered internal use only and an exception is thrown if you try to call them from user code.\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nA runtime exception is detected in the server log naming a class and method called from a visual snippet in the application.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe reason the method you selected in the snippet editor cannot be called in the JAR in the plugins directory is because of the architecture of the server. JARs in the plugins directory have a list that specifies what classes in the JAR can be called. This is called the exports list, and it is honored by the class loader the server uses. Classes not on the list are considered internal use only. Thus, not all classes in the server plugin JARs are available to be called by user code. \n\nYou can call any method when the JAR is in the server's library directorym because it is not being treated as a plugin and a different class loader is used, one which does not implement the exports list.\n\nThe snippet editor is not aware of this mechanism so it treats a plugin JAR the same as a regular Java JAR file. That is it allows you to select the (unavailable) class and method to call in your program. The resolution is to make sure that classes you call in plugin JARs appear on the exports list. \n\nFor example you may search for StringUtils and find the class org.apache.commons.lang.StringUtils in the WebSphere JAR plugin/com.ibm.ws.jpa.jar. This class is used internally by the plugin and it is not exported.

For more information on the \"itmpatch\" command, see\nsection 6.2.\n\nOn Windows systems, if the fix was expanded to\n<TEMP>\\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001, the install command is:\n\nFor 32 bit Agent:\n> <TEMP>\\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME>\n-i <TEMP>\\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\KOQ_winnt_tema_if0001.cab\n\nFor 64 bit Agent:\n> <TEMP>\\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> \n-i <TEMP>\\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\KOQ_wix64_tema_if0001.cab\n\nNote : Use \"itmpatch\" command from <TEMP>\\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\ \ntemporary directory.\n\n5.3 Remote agent update\n-----------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n(6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001.tar or .zip) to a temporary directory\non the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server system. For the\npurpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP> represents the fully\nqualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems\nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a \ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the \nsupported platforms.\n\n3. To add the agent fix bundles into the remote deploy depot, use\nthe \"tacmd addBundles\" command found in $CANDLEHOME/bin on UNIX\nsystems or in %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin on Windows systems. For more\ninformation on the \"tacmd addBundles\" command, see the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring Administrator's Guide.\n\nOn UNIX systems,\nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>/6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001:\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>/6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\n\nOn Windows systems,\nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>\\6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\n\nwhere:\n-n indicates that prerequisite bundles are not automatically\nadded. The -n parameter must be used because the fix \ndirectory does not contain any prerequisites that the fix\nmight require. Please see Section 3.1 for the prerequisites\nfor this fix.\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to \nbe added to the depot. \n\n4. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server, and deploy\nthe fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use\nthe following \"tacmd\" commands. For more information on the\n\"tacmd login\" and \"tacmd updateAgent\" commands, see \"IBM Tivoli \nMonitoring Command Reference\".\n\nOn UNIX systems: \n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd updateAgent -t OQ -n <Managed system name> -v 063108001\n\nOn Windows systems:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd updateAgent -t OQ -n <Managed system name> -v 063108001\n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is \nspecified as two characters (oq), not three characters (koq).\n- The node (-n) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is the\nmanaged system name of the operating system (OS) agent to be\nupdated.\nThe target node for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is always\nan OS agent.\n\n5. To check if Remote Agent Update is SUCCESS/INPROGRESS/FAILED use the command \n>tacmd getDeployStatus <transaction id>\n\nwhere transaction id is the id provided after updateAgent command.\n\n5.4 Agent support update\n------------------------\nUse the following steps to update the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server, \nTivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop.\n\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001.tar or .zip) to the \nTivoli Enterprise Monitoring Servers, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Servers\nor Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktops.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems\nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a \ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported\nplatforms.\n\n3. Expand the archive file (koq_tems_teps_tepd_if0001.tar or .zip)\nthat contains the updates for Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server, \nTivoli Enterprise Portal Server, and Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop \nusing the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems or an \nextract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a \ndirectory structure that includes a subdirectory called CD-ROM,\nwith the necessary updates.\n\n4. Use the Application Support Installer(ASI) script to launch either \nGUI installation or silent installation of the application \nsupport files. \n\nNote: For IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3 or above, one\nof the following additional steps must be performed.\n\n1. Acquire a platform-specific pre-packaged JRE version \nof the Application Support Installer (ASI). See IBM \nTivoli Monitoring Application Support Installer, \n6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002 at \nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924]\nfor download and installation instructions.\n\n2. Specify the '-j javahome' parameter with the path to \na java(r) 1.5 or java 1.6 installation when running \nthe itmasi.sh or itmasi.bat script described below. \n\nGUI installation option\n------------------------\nThe GUI can be started by using one of the following commands\nfrom within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is located.\n\nOn UNIX systems:\n> ./itmasi.sh [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nOn Windows systems:\n> itmasi [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nwhere:\n-h <CANDLEHOME> - Required. The path to the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory.\n\n-j <JAVAHOME> - Optional. The fully-qualified path to the\n\"bin\" directory where Java(R) is installed.\nThe location of Java on your system might\nvary.\n\nWhen prompted by the Application Support Installer for the \ninstallable media directory, select the CD-ROM directory, not\nthe component directory. The installer can install updates for \nmultiple components at the same time.\n\nSilent installation option\n--------------------------\nTo use the silent installation option, use one of the following\ncommands from within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is \nlocated. \n\nNote: Agent support upgrade for IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3 \nor above on Linux, zLinux, Solaris and windows operating systems \nrequires the following files contained in interim fix \n6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002. This is applicable to both GUI and \nsilent installation option of agent support upgrade.\n- Linux: setupLinux.bin\n- zLinux: setupLinux390.bin\n- Solaris: setupSolaris.bin\n- Windows: setupwin32.exe\n\nFollow the installation instructions contained in the\n\"6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002.README\".\n\nOn UNIX systems:\n> ./itmasi.sh -h <CANDLEHOME>[-silent] \n[-r <response file>] \n[-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nOn Windows systems:\n> itmasi -h <CANDLEHOME> [-silent] \n[-r <response file>] \n[-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nwhere:\n-h <CANDLEHOME> - Required. The path to the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory.\n\n-r <response file> - Required. Customized response file name.\nThe default response file \"response.txt\" in\nthe CD-ROM directory can be copied and\nmodified as per your environment.\n\n-j <JAVAHOME> - Optional. The fully-qualified path to the\n\"bin\" directory where Java(R) is installed.\nThe location of Java on your system might\nvary.\n\n5. The next panel presented by the Application Support Installer \nasks for the selection of which Tivoli Monitoring components\nyou want to add application support to.\nFor this fix, the check boxes should be set as follows:\n\nUnchecked - Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server(TEMS)\nChecked - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server(TEPS)\nChecked - Tivoli Enterprise Desktop Client(TEPD)\n\nContinue through the remaining GUI panels selecting the\nMicrosoft SQL Server 06.31.08.01 support to complete the\ninstallation.\n\nNote: When support is installed using CLI or GUI for any of the\nabove Tivoli Monitoring components, they are restarted. \n\n\n6. If the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop or Tivoli Enterprise\nPortal Browser was running when the update was installed, it\nmust be restarted.\n\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n=======================================\nAny existing Microsoft SQL Server Agent instances should be restarted\nafter the installation of this fix.\n\n6.1 Installation instructions for agent baroc file\n--------------------------------------------------\nFix (6.3.1.8-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001) includes changes to the agent\nbaroc files which need to be reinstalled. If you have already\ninstalled these baroc files, there are no additional installation\nsteps. If not, refer to IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Installation\nand Setup Guide under \"Installing monitoring agent baroc files\non the event server\" in \"Installing the IBM Tivoli Enterprise\nConsole Event Synchronization\" section for more information.\n\n6.2 Additional information on using \"itmpatch\" command\n----------------------------------------------------\nThe \"itmpatch\" command has the following syntax.\n\nUsage: itmpatch -h <installation home> [OPTIONS]\n\nitmpatch -h <installation home>\n-t { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }\n\nitmpatch -h <installation home>\n-i { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }\n\nwhere:\n-h Specifies the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory\n-i Specifies the path to the directory or patch file to be \ninstalled\n-t Generates a report of the actions to be taken by the patch\n\nFor example, on UNIX systems:\n- To preview the fix installation, use the \"-t\" option:\n> <CANDLEHOME>/bin/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -t <TEMP>\n\n- To install the fix, use the \"-i\" option:\n> <CANDLEHOME>/bin/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -i <TEMP>\n\nwhere:\n<CANDLEHOME> is the fully qualified IBM Tivoli Monitoring \ninstallation directory. On Windows systems, this path must include\nthe drive letter.\n<TEMP> represents the fully qualified directory specification where\nthe fix is located. On Windows systems, this must include the drive\nletter.\n\n6.3 Verifying the update\n------------------------\n1. To verify the agent was updated correctly, use the \"tacmd\" command\nto view the agent's current version after the agent is restarted.\nYou are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer prior to viewing the agent version.\n\nFor example:\nOn UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli \nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis '/opt/IBM/ITM'.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t OQ\n\nOn Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t OQ \n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the tacmd \"listSystems\" command is \nspecified as two characters (OQ), not three characters (KOQ).\n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is:\n06.31.08.01.\n\nAfter the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify\nthe agent was successfully updated.\nFor the agent on Windows systems, the version number is \n06.31.08.01.\n\n2. To verify the agent support files were updated correctly, use \nthe \"kincinfo\" command on Windows systems or the \"cinfo\" command\non Linux or UNIX systems. The sample output below shows the \nversions of the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli \nEnterprise Monitoring Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nDesktop systems after this fix has been successfully applied.\n\nNote: The displayed build date and installation date might not \nbe accurate. This is known problem.\n\nOn UNIX or Linux systems:\n-------------------------\nTo validate that all components have been installed, run the\nfollowing command:\n\n./cinfo -i\n\nOn Windows systems:\n-------------------\nTo validate that all components have been installed, run the\nfollowing command:\n\nFor example:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\InstallITM\\kincinfo -i\n\nC:\\Users\\Administrator>kincinfo -i\n************* Monday, March 21, 2016 6:18:11 PM *************\nUser : Administrator Group : NA\nHost Name : ESX1-SQL-T-9 Installer : Ver: 063004000\nCandleHome : C:\\IBM\\ITM\nInstallitm : C:\\IBM\\ITM\\InstallITM\n*************************************************************\n...Product Inventory\nOQ TEMS App Support/Microsoft SQL Server Support\nWINNT Version: 06.31.08.00 Build: 60071\n\nOQ TEPS App Support/Microsoft SQL Server Support\nWINNT Version: 06.31.08.01 Build: 60711\n\nOQ TEPB App Support/Microsoft SQL Server Support\nWINNT Version: 06.31.08.00 Build: 60071\n\nOQ TEPD App Support/Microsoft SQL Server Support\nWINNT Version: 06.31.08.01 Build: 60711\n\n\n\n7.0 Known problems and workarounds\n==================================\nAbstract: itmpatch command fails during upgrade\nProblem: When itmpatch command is executed, it fails while upgrading\nagent fix pack.

It may be necessary to return the appliance to IBM for repair.\nThe reinit CLI command will allow you to reconfigure an IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA appliance. The reinit CLI command will allow you to delete (not erase) all existing configuration and data from an IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA appliance.\n\nWhen the reinitialize command completes, your network IP configurations, user accounts and other configuration options, are no longer accessible. \n\nYou will only be able to connect to the appliance using the serial connection. \n\nYou will need to configure your Ethernet and all other settings again using the information in the product information center available from our library page [http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/datapower/library/index.html].\n\nImportant points: \n\n * Make sure you have a working serial connection to the appliance. \n   \n   \n * The admin password will revert to the initial value of \"admin\" after the command executes.\n   \n   \n * A firmware image must be on the appliance prior to running the command. The firmware image used for the last upgrade of the device is removed from the file system automatically when the device reboots. Use DataPower's File Management WebGUI option to confirm you have an image or use these CLI commands:\n   xi52# configure\n   xi52# dir image:\n   If an image file is not found, you will need to load a firmware image to the appliance into the image:/// directory. For example: you can use the WebGUI file management options or from the Control Panel, choose the System Control icon, the under Boot Image, choose the firmware file upload options.\n   \n   \n * Use the DataPower File Management to confirm you have sufficient file space. If you don't have sufficient file space, you can delete domains or other files to free up file space to allow the firmware image to be loaded to the appliance. \n   \n   \n * reinit is a CLI command available in the config-flash# mode, for example:\n   \n   xi52# configure terminal\n   Global configuration mode \n   xi52(config)# flash \n   Flash configuration mode \n   xi52(config-flash)#\n   reinit <filename> \n   \n   Where <filename> represents a firmware image contained within the image:/// directory. This will be the firmware image which will be installed during the reinit process. For more CLI commands, refere to the following doc link:\n   http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wsdatap/v5r0m0/nav/4_4 [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wsdatap/v5r0m0/nav/4_4] \n   \n   \n * After the appliance reboots:  *  If the firmware image used was for V5 or newer, you will need to accept the license at first logon to the WebGui Configure the appliance per the instructions in the appliances configuration guide. This and other documentation on the appliance is available from our library page [http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/datapower/library/index.html]. \n   \n   \n\n\n\nThe command is documented in the information center. This and other documentation on the appliance is available from our library page [http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/datapower/library/index.html]. \n\nIf your appliance has the optional RAID (hard drives) reinitialize the RAID using the information in our RAID technote [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21358544]. \n\nIf your appliance has the optional HSM, reinitialize the HSM following the instructions in our HSM book or infocenter for your release of the product.

You must operate at the Version 2.1 or higher firmware level. Subsequently, when moving from Version 1.0 or Version 2.0 levels to Version 2.1 levels, you cannot roll back to previous firmware versions.\n\nWhen upgrading from Version 2.1.0.x \nTo upgrade the collective while servicing workloads, you must complete the firmware upgrade process on one appliance before starting the process on another appliance within the collective. After upgrading one appliance, monitor the replication completion in the monitoring console before proceeding to upgrade the next appliance. Do not make any configuration changes until all of the appliances are on the same firmware level. See Updating the firmware [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wdpxc/v2r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.datapower.xc.doc/aa/aat_updating_firmware.html] in the WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance Information Center, for more information.\n\nWhen upgrading from Version 2.0.0.x\nWhen you are upgrading to Version 2.1.0.3 from a version prior to Version 2.1, you cannot run a firmware upgrade on a collective that is currently servicing a workload. When you upgrade a collective, all of the data that was loaded into the data grids is lost. The XC10 collective configuration is preserved during the upgrade process. When you are running firmware upgrades on the appliances in a collective, the appliance that you upgrade does not fully restart until all of the appliances in the collective are upgraded to the 2.1 firmware.\n\nWhen upgrading from Version 1.0.0.x\nYou cannot upgrade from this level to the most recent level. You must first upgrade to Version 2.0, and then upgrade to Version 2.1.0.3.\n\nINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS\nComplete the following instructions to download the firmware and client images. \n\n 1. Initialize and configure the appliance.\n    The firmware upgrades for the 9235-92x and 7199-92x appliances are available in this document.

You can create and manage a keystore using the standard Java keytool facilities as documented on the Sun web site http://java.sun.com/ [http://java.sun.com/]. \n\nOnce keystore is created, you need to modify 'server.xml' file located under server's conf directory.

Because we mandate that an IBM JRE is used, we need to use the IbmX509 algorithm for authentication. \n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nTo resolve the issue: \n\n \n\n 1. Open the 'server.xml' file for edit \n 2. Modify the last two entries 'keystoreFile' and 'keystorePass' as shown below:\n\n\n *  \n   *** text start *** <Connector port=\"8443\" maxHttpHeaderSize=\"8192\"\n   maxThreads=\"150\" minSpareThreads=\"25\" maxSpareThreads=\"75\"\n   enableLookups=\"false\" disableUploadTimeout=\"true\"\n   acceptCount=\"100\" scheme=\"https\" secure=\"true\"\n   clientAuth=\"false\" sslProtocol=\"TLS\"\n   keystoreFile=\"c:\\DOORS\\DWA\\keystore\"\n   keystorePass=\"changeit\" algorithm=\"IbmX509\" \n   \n   /> \n   \n   *** text end ***\n   \n   \n   \n\n3. Please note: the second last line on the above new entry was created a self signed certificate using the keygen tool using the IBM JRE ($DWA\\win32\\ibm-java2-i386\\jre) and applied the changes above in the 'server.xml' file.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Rational DOORS", "content_type": "text", "id": "swg21403991"}, "is_correct_answer": true, "is_correct_document": true, "origin": "gold-label", "answer": {"answer": ""}, "no_answer": true}, {"query": "I need to understand details regarding Action required for IBM Integration Bus Hypervisor Edition V9.0 and WebSphere Message Broker Hypervisor Edition V8.0 for security vulnerabilities in Red Hat Linux.

It is strongly recommended to review the platform information on IBM Software Product Compatibility Reports [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/prodguid/v1r0/clarity/index.jsp]. The installation of IBM SPSS Statistics software on Apple Macintosh OSX operating systems requires an Intel processor. \n\nA) Apple Macintosh MacOS High Sierra (10.13) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 25 only. Please note that no other SPSS release will be officially supported on High Sierra, but older versions like SPSS Statistics 24 may run as well on High Sierra. \n\nNOTE: There's a known issue with some of the earlier release of Mac High Sierra system (13.0 and 13.1 beta version). \nThe top menu of SPSS 25 may disappear if the Mac OS system is set to Non-English. \nThe official MacOSX 10.13.1 version do not have this issue. So, if you encountert this issue you need to update your Mac OS version to latest official 10.13.1 build from Apple. \n\n \n\nB) Apple Macintosh MacOS Sierra (10.12) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 25 and IBM SPSS Statistics 24 only. For release 24 It is also recommended to install the latest FixPack 2 for release 24 on Mac [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043574]. [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24042675] \n\nNo older SPSS Statistics releases are supported on Sierra. \n\n \n\nC) Apple Macintosh OSX El Capitan (10.11) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 24. Please see the Release notes - IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27047057] for known issues on Macintosh. \n\nFull documentation including installation material provided in different languages and manuals for release 24 can be found on IBM SPSS Statistics 24 Documentation [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27047033] webpage. \n\n \n\nAlso, Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 23.

If you like to use Statistics 22 on Yosemite you need to install Statistics 22 Fixpack 2 as well. Statistics 22 FixPack 2 and release Statistics 23 are fully tested on Yosemite OSX 10.10. So if you like to run Statistics 22 on Yosemite please install Statistics 22 FixPack 2 and also read the section below: \n\n**** \n\nIn some instances it can be necessary to re-install the legacy Apple Java 6 on 10.10 for the use of Statistics 22 FixPack 2 on this platform\n\nDownload and re-install Apple Java 6 \n\n- After you upgraded your Apple Mac OSX from a previous release to 10.10, Apple Java 6 may no longer exists on your upgraded system. If you then launch Statistics 22 which is an application that relies on Java 6, it can happen, the Mac OS pops up a dialog box stating Java 6 was requested, but none is present.\n- The Java dialog has a \"More Info\" button, which when clicked opens a browser to an Apple Tech Support page for Apple Java 2014-001. A download link is provided:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572 [http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572]\n- Click on the download link and a DMG containing the Java 6 installer is downloaded.\n- Then you open the Java DMG, double click on the Java installer, follow the prompts and complete the installation of Java 6.\n\n******* \n\n \n\nE) Apple Macintosh OSC Mavericks (10.9) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 23 and IBM SPSS Statistics 22 \n\n*** \n\nNote: IBM SPSS Statistics 22 was developed and released prior to Apple's release of OS X 10.9 (Mavericks). However, Statistics 22 can be installed on Mac OSX 10.9 if you install Apple Java SE 6 (1.6.0_65) on OS X 10.9 first before you install Statistics 22.

What is considered a normal deployment time and what can be done to reduce it? \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nWhen the deployment starts from the workbench, the engine is suspended and it takes some processing. It needs to stop all the worker threads in tag engine, entity manager and event manager. To stop each worker thread, it needs to wait for all the work completed by the current worker thread. For example, for entity manager, they have to complete all the entity management processing for the records in the internal queue before stopping, this is a normal phenomena.\nThe engine log can show what goes on in the processing for thread stopping for the polling threads for the entity managers and event managers. By default each one of these pollseconds for the entity and event managers threads can take as long as 10 seconds to stop.\nBoth event and entity managers take a pollseconds configuration parameter. \n\nIn version 11.0 onwards: \nEvent Manager: WAS_PROFILE_HOME/conf/com.ibm.mdm.mds.event.manager.cfg \nEntity Manager: WAS_PROFILE_HOME/conf/com.ibm.mdm.mds.entity.manager.cfg\nIn pre-11:\nEvent Manager: MAD_HOMEDIR/inst/instanceName/conf/com.initiate.server.event.cfg\nEntity Manager: MAD_HOMEDIR/inst/instanceName/conf/com.initiate.server.entity.cfg\n\nThere is a sleep used to execute the 10 seconds timeout. This sleep needs to expire before the thread can detect that it has been asked to shutdown. If you have 3 entity types there are: 2 (polling threads for entity and event manager) x 3 (entity types) x 10 (pollseconds) = 60 seconds spent just shutting down the polling threads. \nFor pollseconds we would recommend 1 second for the entity manager and 3 seconds for the event manager but this is the minimum value that can be set, you may multiple 1 and 3 by some number (2,3..) to keep the proportion. This should help to reduce shutdown times.\nThe 1 second poll time for entity manager is the lowest reasonable number. We need a delay so we don't flood the database with select requests causing the database to churn for no reason. The 3 seconds for the event manager is because the event manager should always poll less often than the entity manager to allow it to finish its work before event manager kicks off it's work. It should actually be much higher (at least 30 seconds) to group the work in nice chunks.", "content_type": "text", "id": "swg21711479"}, "is_correct_answer": true, "is_correct_document": true, "origin": "gold-label", "answer": {"answer": ""}, "no_answer": true}, {"query": "Is Java 8 supported for EJBDeploy on WebSphere Application Server 8.5.5.9 or later?", "document": {"content": "EJB; EJBDeploy TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n Learning more about EJBDeploy is the first step in the troubleshooting process.

The filter has two main sections called \u201cexpressions\u201d and \u201cparameters\u201d. The \u201cexpressions\u201d section defines the list of supported data types and their regular expressions. The regular expression is used to validate the request parameter value. Some of the predefined data types are Boolean, ipAddress, ipV6Address, number and so on. For a numeric data type, the expression definition is:\n\n<object key=\"expression\">\n<setting key=\"name\"> number </setting>\n<setting key=\"regexp\"> ^-?\\d+$ </setting>\n</object>\n\nThe \u201cparameters\u201d section contains the list of request parameters and the corresponding data types. For a numeric data type parameter, the parameter mapping definition is:\n\n<object key=\"parameter\">\n<setting key=\"name\">detailedPageSize</setting>\n<setting key=\"expression\">number</setting>\n</object> \n\nBased on these two definitions, the \u201cdetailedPageSize\u201d parameter value will be validated for numeric value only. Any other non-numeric value will be rejected by the filter.\n\nThe customer can add new \u201cexpression\u201d definitions and new \u201cparameter\u201d mappings needed to address their security requirements.\n\n\n2) ScriptSecurityFilter filter\n\nThe \u201cScriptSecurityFilter\u201d filter is a black list filter that evaluates the request parameter value for invalid script values. The filter will reject an incoming request if an invalid script value is found. Similar to the previous filter, the \u201cScriptSecurityFilter\u201d has two main sections: \u201cexpressions\u201d and \u201cparameter\u201d. The \u201cexpressions\u201d section contains a list of regular expressions that is used to identify invalid scripts. The customer can modify this regular expression list to define any new expressions needed to address the security requirements.\n\n<array key=\"expressions\">\n<value>&lt;\\s*img\\s*</value>\n<value>&lt;\\s*script\\s*&gt;</value>\n<value>&lt;/\\s*script\\s*&gt;</value>\n<value>\\s*javascript\\s*:|(^|\\s+)on[a-zA-Z]*\\s*=</value>\n<value>\\s*\\'\\s*[\\+;\\-]</value>\n<value>\\s*\\\"\\s*[\\+;\\-]</value> \n<value>\\s+STYLE\\s*=</value>\n</array\n\nThe \u201cparameters\u201d section contains the list of request parameters that will be checked against the \u201cexpressions\u201d entries for invalid scripts. The \u201cparameter\u201d section supports an \u201cincludes\u201d list and an \u201cexcludes\u201d list. All parameters in the \u201cincludes\u201d will be tested for invalid scripts.\n\n<array key=\"includes\">\n<value>eventTarget</value>\n<value>eventName</value>\n<value>dummy</value>\n<value>browserTime1</value>\n<value>browserTime2</value>\n<value>browserOffset1</value>\n<value>browserOffset2</value>\n\u2026..\n</array>\n\n\nFor more information:\nPlease refer to the following techdoc for more details on addressing Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities within FileNet Workplace XT and FileNet Workplace (Application Engine): http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27022201 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27022201] \n\nGET NOTIFIED ABOUT FUTURE SECURITY BULLETINS\n Subscribe to My Notifications [ http://www-01.ibm.com/software/support/einfo.html] to be notified of important product support alerts like this. \n\nREFERENCES\nComplete CVSS v3 Guide [http://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide] \nOn-line Calculator v3 [http://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0] \n\nRELATED INFORMATION\nIBM Secure Engineering Web Portal [http://www.ibm.com/security/secure-engineering/bulletins.html] \nIBM Product Security Incident Response Blog [http://www.ibm.com/blogs/psirt] \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThis vulnerability was reported to IBM by Roshan Thomas at secvibe.com \n\nCHANGE HISTORY\n 7 Oct 2016: Original version published \n\n*The CVSS Environment Score is customer environment specific and will ultimately impact the Overall CVSS Score.

This may include scan results, capacity data, etc.\n\n\nCAUSE\nBFI/SUA/LMT is designed to import only newly created data. To achieve this, the data is marked with the so-called sequence number. The sequence number is incremented during every change, upload, scan, etc. Every import contains data starting from the sequence number reported during the last successful import to the current sequence number. \n\nWhen the database is restored, the sequence number is restored to the value from the time when the database backup was created. Because of that, it might happen that the sequence number after the restoration is lower than the sequence number reported during the last successful import. In such case, the first import after the database restoration does not include any data. After that import, the sequence number is updated and the next import contains new data. Depending on your scan settings, you might need to wait some time for the import that contains new data. \n\nWhen the database is restored, the sequence number is restored to the value from the time when the database backup was created.\n\nData for the period from the last successful import before the restoration of the database until the restoration is never imported (obviously, as the data was removed by restoring the DB) and needs to be re-generated by re-running the scans if needed. \n\nData from DB restoration time until first successful import is also by default not imported (causing a gap). To cover this gap you may follow the procedure described below.\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nWarning: The following procedure will impact the length of the first import after the sequence is reset. After performing below steps ALL DATA from all endpoints available on BigFix server side will be imported (not only covering the problematic gap). For big environments the impact may be huge and it is better to re-run scans on selected endpoints instead.\n\n1) Ensure that the import is not running and stop the BFI/SUA/LMT server.\n2) To reset the sequence for all data sources and import all data, run the following query on the BFI/SUA/LMT database:\n\nDB2:\nUPDATE dbo.DATASOURCE_SEQUENCES set LAST_SEQUENCE = blob(x'0000000000000000');\n\nMSSQL:\nUPDATE dbo.datasource_sequences set last_sequence = 0x0000000000000000;\n\n3) Start the BFI/SUA/LMT. \n4) Run an import.\n\n \n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Security IBM BigFix Inventory", "content_type": "text", "id": "swg21977398"}, "is_correct_answer": true, "is_correct_document": true, "origin": "gold-label", "answer": {"answer": "1) Ensure that the import is not running and stop the BFI/SUA/LMT server.\n2) To reset the sequence for all data sources and import all data, run the following query on the BFI/SUA/LMT database:\n\nDB2:\nUPDATE dbo.DATASOURCE_SEQUENCES set LAST_SEQUENCE = blob(x'0000000000000000');\n\nMSSQL:\nUPDATE dbo.datasource_sequences set last_sequence = 0x0000000000000000;\n\n3) Start the BFI/SUA/LMT. \n4) Run an import."}, "no_answer": false}, {"query": "Is it possible to get IIB General Availability (GA) code from somewhere else or is it only available on Passport Advantage?\n", "document": {"content": "install; download; fix; product; DWA DOWNLOADABLE FILES\n\nABSTRACT\n This document describes how to download IBM Rational DOORS Web Access Version 1.4 components using the Passport Advantage Online website. \n\nDOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION\n\n\nTAB NAVIGATION\n * IBM Rational DOORS 9.3- selected tab,\n * Passport Advantage [http://ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage/index.html]\n\n\n\n\n\nIBM Rational DOORS Web Access versions 1.4 is a full product download.\n * Passport Advantage customers\n   Passport Advantage and Passport Advantage Express customers are required to sign in to Passport Advantage Online [https://www.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/softwareandservices/passportadvantage] to access the actual files.\n * \n * Non-Passport Advantage customers\n   If you or your organization did not purchase your software and support through Passport Advantage or Passport Advantage Express, you are required to sign in to the new IBM Software Group OEM Portal [https://www.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/softwareandservices/oem] to access the actual files.

Additionally, there's no option to specify the Service name when configuring the JBoss server during the configuration steps. \n\nIf you are using JBoss AS 7.1 or JBoss EAP 6.1.0 or 6.2.0 or 6.3.0, then you will need the to use the latest patch first, [https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/208313/how-do-i-download-the-new-itcam-for-j2ee-711-la-if.html]then run the standalone.bat (or domain.bat) program from the command-line after successful configuration. \n\nNote: If you have a Tomcat server, then you will be able to use that server in a Service, the technote is here.

You can switch it back to HTTP. \n\nDOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION\nWhen Business Process Choreographer Explorer uses the default secure HTTPS protocol, any attempts to access Business Process Choreographer Explorer using HTTP are redirected to use HTTPS. If you need Business Process Choreographer Explorer to support insecure HTTP connections, you can use the unsecureExplorer.ant script to switch the protocol used from HTTPS to HTTP. \n\nAttention: It is not recommend to use the insecure HTTP protocol. Using HTTP for the Business Process Choreographer Explorer can open your organization to possible security problems.\n\nSwitching to HTTP\n\nIf you need to switch Business Process Choreographer Explorer from HTTPS to use HTTP, complete the following actions: \n\n 1. Download the unsecureExplorer.ant script file, which is attached near the bottom of this page.\n    \n    \n 2. If you previously switched Business Process Choreographer Explorer to use HTTP, but are performing this task again because you are installing an interim fix, fix pack, or refresh pack that updated Business Process Choreographer Explorer has reverted it back to the default HTTPS protocol, you must first delete the old (invalid) backup EAR file before running the script.\n    \n     * On Linux, UNIX-based and z/OS platforms, delete the install_root/ProcessChoreographer/internal/bpcexplorer_secure_backup.ear file. \n     * On Microsoft Windows platforms, delete the\n       install_root\\ProcessChoreographer\\internal\\bpcexplorer_secure_backup.ear file.\n       \n       \n    \n    \n 3. Run the script to patch the bpcexplorer.ear file. In a network deployment environment, you must run the script on the deployment manager.  * On Linux, UNIX-based and z/OS platforms, enter the following command:\n       install_root/ws_ant.sh -f unsecureExplorer.ant \n     * On Windows platforms, enter the following command:\n       install_root\\ws_ant.bat -f unsecureExplorer.ant\n       Note: A backup copy of the original EAR file is created named bpcexplorer_secure_backup.ear.\n       \n       \n    \n    \n 4. Deploy the patched bpcexplorer.ear file by updating the profile. For more information about updating profiles for an interim fix, see one of the following documents:  * For version 8.0.1.x: Profile update instructions for IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) interim fixes [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21608414]. \n     * For version 8.5 and later: Profile update instructions for IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) interim fixes [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21637449].\n       \n       \n    \n    \n\nRemember: In the future, if you install an interim fix, fix pack, or refresh pack that updates the Business Process Choreographer Explorer, it will revert to using the default secure HTTPS protocol. If that happens and you still need the Business Process Choreographer Explorer to use the HTTP protocol, you must complete these steps again to re-enable the HTTP protocol. \n\n\n\nSwitching back to HTTPS \n\nIf you need to switch Business Process Choreographer Explorer back from HTTP to HTTPS, complete the following actions:  1. Change to the directory where the backup EAR file is located.  * On Linux, UNIX-based and z/OS platforms, its location is \n       install_root/ProcessChoreographer/internal \n     * On Windows platforms, its location is \n       install_root\\ProcessChoreographer\\internal\n       \n       \n    \n    \n 2. In that directory, copy or rename the backup EAR file bpcexplorer_secure_backup.ear to bpcexplorer.ear and overwrite any existing copy.\n    \n    \n 3.

To store values for user or group attributes beyond Virtual Member Manager (VMM) default file based repository's schema, you must extend the schema.\nTo do so, follow the procedure for running wp-add-property per the InfoCenter section corresponding to your operating system. This procedure includes restarting WebSphere Portal to pick up the VMM configuration changes. Refer to the link below for AIX. This procedure updates <profile>/config/cells/<cell>/wim/model/wimxmlextension.xml. \n\nFor example, running wp-add-property with the following values in wkplc.properties:\n\nla.providerURL=corbaloc:iiop:localhost:10031\nla.propertyName=testproperty1\nla.entityTypes=PersonAccount\nla.dataType=String\nla.multiValued=false\n\nresults in wimxmlextension.xml containing:\n\n<wim:schema>\n...\n[https://ecurep.mainz.de.ibm.com/aexfiles/pmr/1/3/13827%2C500%2C000/support_files/wimxmlextension.xml#]<wim:propertySchema ... dataType=\"STRING\"multiValued=\"false\"propertyName=\"testproperty1\">\n<wim:applicableEntityTypeNames>PersonAccount</wim:applicableEntityTypeNames>\n</wim:propertySchema>\n...\n</wim:schema>\n\nVMM's schema is now extended to include testproperty1 for entities of type PersonAccount stored in the file repository. You do not need to map the attribute as you would with an LDAP repository. You do not need to configure a database to store the attribute as you would with a property extension database.\n\nFile repositories can be identified in <profile>/config/cells/<cell>/wim/config/wimconfig.xml by:\n\n<config:repositories xsi:type=\"config:FileRepositoryType\"adapterClassName=\"com.ibm.ws.wim.adapter.file.was.FileAdapter\" id=\"InternalFileRepository\" supportPaging=\"false\" messageDigestAlgorithm=\"SHA-1\">\n<config:baseEntries name=\"o=defaultWIMFileBasedRealm\"/>\n</config:repositories>\n\n\nTo access this property via portlets installed by default with WebSphere Portal:\n\n1. Log in to Portal as an administrator and access the Selfcare portlet via Edit My Profile in theme. Alternatively, you could access the Manage Users and Groups portlet, then edit a particular user. 2. In portlet menu, select \"Configure\". \n3. Check \"testproperty1\" and click OK. \n4. Add a value for testproperty1.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n InfoCenter: Adding attributes (AIX) [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wpdoc/v6r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.wp.ent.doc_v615/install/aix_add_attributes.html]\nIf clustered - la.providerURL consideration [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21358381]", "content_type": "text", "id": "swg21421524"}, "is_correct_answer": true, "is_correct_document": true, "origin": "gold-label", "answer": {"answer": ""}, "no_answer": true}, {"query": "We are trying to perform the following steps on our Portal cluster...\n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHRKX_8.5.0/mp/install/add_attributes.html\n\nWe successfully ran the wp-la-install-ear task but now when attempting to run the wp-add-property task we see the following error in the ConfigTrace.log....\n\n [wplc-add-property] [2016-10-11 15:57:32.065] Can not find EJB:\n ejb/com/ibm/websphere/wim/ejb/WIMServiceHome\n [wplc-add-property] javax.naming.NameNotFoundException: Context:\n dmgrCell01/nodes/dmgrNode01/servers/dmgr, name:\n ejb/com/ibm/websphere/wim/ejb/WIMServiceHome: First component in name\n websphere/wim/ejb/WIMServiceHome not found.

This can be very helpful when a debug log level is needed to help isolate a problem or monitor behavior over a long period of time or can be used in production environment as DataPower only keeps a limited number of log files (the default is 3 files) in the file system in a rotational basis. \n\nCAUSE\nThe DataPower device has a finite amount of space to hold larger than average log files or long term logging needs in production environment. \n\nIt should be noted that if used while debugging at load or in a capacity issue, log events may be dropped. There is a prioritization of events within the device and client traffic always comes first. Log events dropped can be confirmed or counted from the Status>Log Targets menu in the WebGUI.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nConfigure a server daemon to listen and capture the DataPower devices events. First, this example shows how to create the log target sending events to a syslog destination. The other examples listed below will have their own strong points to be considered depending on the problem scenario. \n\n \n\nSyslog: \n\n* The syslog protocol operates over UDP which has no guarantee on packet delivery - a fast fire and forget method. \n\nTo create the new log target, go into the default domain: Objects > Log Targets \n\nConfigure the log target with settings as follows from the WebGUI: \n\n 1. Name the log target \n 2. Select Target Type of syslog \n 3. Fill in the Local Identifier with a descriptive string that may be used by a remote recipient to identify this specific log target \n 4. Enter the Remote Host Address and the Remote IP Port as in the screen shot wherex.x.x.x is the IP address of the remote syslog server that listens on port 514 \n 5. Take all other defaults\n\n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=1]  \n\n \n\nUnder the Event Subscriptions tab, you can select all and debug as indicated here: \n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=2] \n\n * \n * 6. Generate log events in the DataPower by using some transactions, for example by saving the configuration from the WebGUI or running some test load into a domain.\n\n\nSyslog-ng, will simply work over the TCP protocol to ensure the packet is delivered to the destination. The same consideration should be applied to a device under high load in that a log event could be dropped if not able to be wrote out to the network within time. \n\n \n\nNFS:\nAll NFS limitations apply from file size and permission settings. This is a more common approach using an NFS static mount to capture a log target and can allow for slightly more reliable messages to be logged. The limiting factor again is the speed of the network and NFS server response time. \n\n \n\nFile type: \n\nUsing a file type log target with a backup method as seen here:\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=3]\nThis will allow log events to quickly be written to a local file on the device's file system. Once the file reaches its set size a connection to the destination will upload the file from the device. This will upload with a unique time and date stamp on the uploaded file.\n\nThis is a useful method to capture sporadic problems. This is also useful for long running transactions that may span more than one file depending on device load.\n\n\nHTTP service:\nFinally a clever method that may be used in some senarios would be an HTTP service on the device.\nUsing an HTTP service configured in the following way,\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=4] \n\nOnce the file type log is created in the logtemp:/// directory, a client browser or wget type client can easily retrieve the file from the device. \n\nThis is very useful when there is no local or accessible remote log storage location to the device, due to firewall or network restrictions. \n\nThis is also removing the limitation of the device dropping the log event should it not be able to write the log event to the network. \n\nEach of the above methods are very useful and work better in some scenarios than others depending on the network, load, problem, and information needed.

Similar to other \nupgrade software, you can install the fix pack image locally on a \ncomputer where the product software is not already installed.\n* You can populate agents to the depot.\n* You can deploy agents remotely to existing or new installations.\n\nWhen this fix pack image is downloaded from Passport Advantage, these rules \napply:\n* You can install the fix pack locally on a system that hosts a \nlicensed copy of IBM Tivoli Monitoring for Databases already.\n* You can install the fix pack locally on a system that does not host \na licensed copy of IBM Tivoli Monitoring for Databases already.\n* You can populate agents to the depot.\n* You can deploy agents remotely to existing or new installations.\n\n\n5.1 Before installing the fix\n-----------------------------\n- The prerequisites listed under section 3.1 entitled 'Upgrade prerequisites \nfor this fix' must be installed when upgrading.\n\n- For the purpose of this README, the <CANDLEHOME> symbol is the \nIBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory. The default value\nfor CANDLEHOME is '/opt/IBM/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\\ibm\\itm'\non Windows systems.\n\n- If you customize the Extended Monitoring Agent for WebSphere DataPower Appliance \nbn.ini file on a UNIX system, back up this file before installing the fix. \nAfter this fix is installed, edit the latest bn.ini file and merge \nyour modifications into this bn.ini file.\n\n\n5.2 Local agent install and update (including silent installation)\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file to a \ntemporary directory on the system that contains the agent code to be \nupdated. For the purpose of this README, the <TEMP> symbol represents \nthe fully qualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter. \n\n2. Expand the archive file by using the tar command on UNIX systems or \nan unzip utility on Windows systems. This expansion creates a directory \nstructure that contains fixes for all supported platforms.\n\n3. Use the procedures in the \"IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Version 6.3 FP3\nInstallation and Setup Guide\" to install the agent.\n\n4. Use the procedures in the specific monitoring agent user's\nguide to complete the installation and configuration.\n\n\n5.3 Remote agent update and installation\n----------------------------------------\n1. Make sure that all potential targets of the remote deployment are\nrunning version 6.2.3 Fix Pack 4 or later of the OS monitoring \nagent.\n2. Transfer the appropriate archive file to \na temporary directory on the Tivoli Enterprise \nMonitoring Server system. For the purpose of this README, the \n<TEMP> symbol represents the fully qualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter. \n\n3. Expand the archive file by using the tar command on UNIX systems or an \nunzip utility on Windows systems. This expansion creates a directory structure\nthat contains fixes for all supported operating systems.\n\n4. To add the fix pack bundles to the remote deployment depot, use the\ntacmd addBundles command found in $CANDLEHOME/bin on UNIX systems\nor in %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin on Windows systems. For more information\nabout the tacmd addBundles command, see the \"IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring Command Reference.\"\n\nOn a UNIX system: if the fix was expanded to \n<TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>:\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>/WINDOWS/Deploy -t bn -f\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>/unix -t bn -f \n\nwhere:\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be\nadded to the depot.\n-t is the product code of the product to add, for example, bn \nrepresents the Extended Monitoring Agent for WebSphere DataPower Appliance\n-f shows that the actions are complete and confirmation is not requested\n\nOn a Windows system: if the fix was expanded to \n<TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>\\<PARTNUMBER>\\WINDOWS\\Deploy -t bn -f\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>\\<PARTNUMBER>\\unix -t bn -f \n\nwhere:\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be\nadded to the depot. \n-t is the product code of the product to add, for example, bn \nrepresents the Extended Monitoring Agent for WebSphere DataPower Appliance\n-f shows that the actions are complete and confirmation is not requested\n\n5. To login to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server and deploy\nthe fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use\nthe following tacmd commands. For more information about the\ntacmd login and updateAgent commands, see the \"IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring Command Reference.\"\n\nOn a UNIX system: \n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the managed system name for the OS agent on the \nremote system to be installed/update. Use this value as the target of the\ntacmd addsystem/updateAgent command. \n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addsystem -t bn \n-n <Managed system name>\n-p <Configration Info>\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd updateAgent -t bn\n-n <Managed system name>\n-v 071003000\n\nOn a Windows system:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%/bin/tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the managed system name for the OS agent on the \nremote system to be installed/updated.

The \ntarget node for an updateAgent command is always an OS agent.\n- The component (-p) for the addsystem command is for agent's configuration info.\nHere is an example:\nINSTANCE=\"value\"\nKQZ_SNMPEVENT.KQZ_SNMPEVENT_PORT=\"162\"\nKQZ_SNMPEVENT.KQZ_SNMPEVENT_SECURITY_LEVEL=\"authPriv\"\nKQZ_SNMPEVENT.KQZ_SNMPEVENT_USER_NAME=\"admin\"\nKQZ_SNMPEVENT.KQZ_SNMPEVENT_AUTH_PROTOCOL=\"SHA\"\nKQZ_SNMPEVENT.KQZ_SNMPEVENT_AUTH_PASSWORD=\"value\"\nKQZ_SNMPEVENT.KQZ_SNMPEVENT_PRIV_PROTOCOL=\"DES\"\nKQZ_SNMPEVENT.KQZ_SNMPEVENT_PRIV_PASSWORD=\"value\"\nDPS:<Managed_System_Name>.SOAP_HOST=\"value\"\nDPS:<Managed_System_Name>.DP_PORT=\"5550\"\nDPS:<Managed_System_Name>.DP_UID=\"admin\"\nDPS:<Managed_System_Name>.DP_PASSWORD=\"value\"\nDPS:<Managed_System_Name>.KBN_LOG_FILE=\"value\"\nDPC:<Managed_System_Name>.SNMP_VERSION=\"snmpV2\"\nDPC:<Managed_System_Name>.SNMP_HOST=\"value\"\nDPC:<Managed_System_Name>.SNMP_PORT=\"161\"\nDPC:<Managed_System_Name>.SNMP_COMMUNITY=\"public\" \n\n- The following error might occur with the updateAgent command on \nLinux and UNIX endpoints; however, the agent is successfully \nupdated. This error does not occur on Windows endpoints.\n\nKUICUA011I: Updating the bn agents.\nKUICUA015E: The updateAgent command did not complete because an\nerror occurred. Refer to the following error\nreturned from the server:\n\nThe monitoring server encountered an error while updating the\nmanaged system type.\n\nThe kuiras1.log file might provide more information about \nthis error. If you require further assistance to resolve the \nerror, contact IBM Software Support.\n\nA timeout occurred while waiting for an agent task to complete on\n{node name}.\n\nThe agent task did not complete within the configured \ntime out period.\n\nVerify that the target system is online. Increase the \ntime out value and try the operation again.\n\n\n\n5.4 Agent support update\n------------------------\nFix 7.1.0-TIV-ITM_WDP-FP0003 included changes to the agent\nsupport files that must be installed. If you installed these updates already, there are no additional installation\nsteps. Otherwise, use the following steps to update the Tivoli\nEnterprise Monitoring Server, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or\nTivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop.\n\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file \nto the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Servers, IBM Tivoli\nEnterprise Portal Servers, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal desktops. \n\n2. Expand the archive file by using the tar command on UNIX systems or an \nunzip utility on Windows systems. \n\n3. Use the procedures in the \"IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Version 6.3 FP3\nInstallation and Setup Guide.\"\n\n4. Use the procedures in the specific monitoring agent user's\nguide to complete the installation and configuration.\n\n5. If the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server that is updated is remote (not a \nHub Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server) then restart the Tivoli Enterprise \nMonitoring Server.\n\n\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n========================\n6.1 Installation instructions for agent baroc file\n-----------------------------------------------------\nThere are no updates to the baroc files included in this fix or\nany of the superseded fixes. No additional installation steps are\nrequired.\n\n6.2 Additional information on new configuration item \"KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL\"\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA new configuration item \"KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL\" is introduced to support TLS.\nThe value should be SSL/TLSv1/TLSv1.1/TLSv1.2. The default value is \"TLSv1\". \nIf you want to support TLSv1.1/TLSv1.2, please change it manually.\n\n1. For Windows platform:\nThe new item \"KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL\" is in KBNENV and KBNENV_<instanceName>.\n\na. Agent instance must be restarted to enable the new configuration change.\nb. The vaule of \"KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL\" in KBNENV_<instanceName> will be updated to \nthe same vaule of \"KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL\" in KBNENV while the instance is re-configured.\n\n2. For Linux/Unix platform:\nThe new items \"KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL\" is in bn.ini and bn_<instanceName>.config.\n\na. Agent instance must be restarted to enable the new configuration change.\nb. The vaule of \"KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL\" in bn_<instanceName>.config will be updated to \nthe same vaule of \"KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL\" in bn.ini while the instance is re-configured.\n\n6.3 Verifying the update\n----------------------------\n1. To verify that the agent was updated correctly, use the tacmd command\nto view the current version of the agent after the agent is restarted.\nYou are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer before viewing the agent version.\n\nFor example:\nOn UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring\ninstallation directory, the default location is '/opt/IBM/ITM'.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t or\n\nOn Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t bn\n\nNote: The component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is\nspecified as two characters (bn), not three characters (kbn).\n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is:\n07.10.03.00\n\nAfter the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify\nthat the agent was successfully updated.\n\nFor the agent on Windows systems, the version number is\n07.10.03.00.\nFor the agent on UNIX systems, the version number is\n07.10.03.00.\n\n2. To verify that the agent support files were updated correctly, use the\nkincinfo command on Windows systems or the cinfo command on\nLinux or UNIX systems. The sample output below shows the versions\nof the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli Enterprise\nMonitoring Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop systems\nafter this fix has been successfully applied.\n\nNote: The date shown for the build might not be accurate.

The customization can filter out information that is not necessary to keep in the DW. A sample implementation is provided that removes information about all the rules that are not fired, which helps keep the size of the trace small when there is a large number of rules in the ruleset and typically a much smaller number of rules actually fire. Also, only the DW persisted trace is smaller, the original larger trace is still used by DVS to perform the tests involved in the scenario suite. \n\nInstructions: \n\n 1. Unjar the attached jrules-ssptrace-src.jar to a local directory \n 2.

When you install application support on the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, you are installing the files required for presenting workspaces and online help for each monitoring agent. When you install application support on the hub monitoring server, you are installing the files required for product-provided situations, situation distributions, and other product-specific data. Installing application support on the hub monitoring server is also known as \"seeding\" the hub.\nMost z/OS-based agents provide application support files on CDs or DVDs, which are separate from the mainframe installation media. Distributed agents include their application support files in the distributed installation process. Each CD /DVD that contains application support files is listed below, with information about which products use the CD /DVD and where the CD / DVD can be found. The latest level in fulfillment is the CD /DVD on this list. Where possible, IBM provides both .zip and .tar formats, as well as .iso format, so that a physical CD / DVD can be created.\n\nPlease note that the IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM) media is separate from the workspace application support files which are included with products that run in the ITM environment. ITM can be obtained by ordering either 5724-C04 IBM Tivoli Monitoring through Passport Advantage or the no charge 5698-A79 IBM Tivoli Management Services on z/OS through Shop zSeries. Your IBM rep can ask Techline to configure and submit the order as well. 5698-A79 includes the server, engine, and configurator on z/OS. Workspace application support files may have their own fixpacks which are separate and distinct from any ITM fixpacks. Fixpacks can be found on the product support urls at: \nhttp://www-306.ibm.com/software/support/index_A_Z.html [http://www-306.ibm.com/software/support/index_A_Z.html].\n\nThe ITM Configuration Guide describes the application support installation process. It can be found online in the ITM information center at: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTFXA_6.3.0/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3/install/agent_support.htm [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTFXA_6.3.0/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3/install/agent_support.htm].

You want to know what is the problem?\n\n\nCAUSE\nSee the following section of the MQ 7.1 documentation:\nWebSphere MQ > Administering > Administering local WebSphere MQ objects > Performing local administration tasks using MQSC commands\nWebSphere MQ object names [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.1.0/com.ibm.mq.doc/fa11060_.htm]\n+ Case-sensitivity in MQSC commands\nMQSC commands, including their attributes, can be written in upper-case or lower-case. Object names in MQSC commands are folded to upper-case (that is, QUEUE and queue are not differentiated), unless the names are enclosed within single quotation marks. If quotation marks are not used, the object is processed with a name in upper-case. \n\nWhen specifying the SET command with the following value CLNTUSER(testuser) the string 'testuser' will be folded to upper-case resulting in the following value being actually used by runmqsc:\nCLNTUSER(TESTUSER)\nAnd in this case, there is no record for the user TESTUSER (the record is for 'testuser').\n\n\nANSWER\nNOTICE that the userid mentioned in the CLNTUSER field of the output of the DISPLAY CHLAUTH command is NOT surrounded by single quotes. \n\nHowever, you MUST include the single quotes when specifying the value during an ACTION(REMOVE):\n\nSET CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('testuser') ACTION(REMOVE)\n1 : set CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('testuser') ACTION(REMOVE)\nAMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.\n\n\n++ Example of record with more attributes\n\nLet's examine the case when a record has more attributes, such as:\n\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') USERSRC(MAP) MCAUSER('user_1') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(ADD)\nAMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.\n\ndisplay CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL)\n9 : display CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL)\nAMQ8878: Display channel authentication record details.\nCHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP)\nDESCR( ) CUSTOM( )\nADDRESS(*) CLNTUSER(client_1)\nMCAUSER(user_1) USERSRC(MAP)\n\nYou want to delete the record and you try the following command which is based on the command that worked well for a simpler case. But this time, it fails:\n\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') ACTION(REMOVE)\nAMQ8884: Channel authentication record not found.\n\nYou try the original command that created the record, but changing the action to REMOVE:\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') USERSRC(MAP) MCAUSER('user_1') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(REMOVE)\nAMQ8885: Parameter not allowed for this action on a channel authentication record.\n\nThe attribute USERSRC is not a valid parameter for the REMOVE action (see table below).\nTherefore, by removing this attribute, then the following command worked successfully to remove the record:\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('mengano') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(REMOVE) \nAMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.\n\nSee:\nWebSphere MQ 8.0.0 > IBM MQ > Reference > Administration reference > MQSC reference > The MQSC commands > \nSET CHLAUTH [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm.mq.ref.adm.doc/q086630_.htm]\n.\n+ begin excerpt\n.\nUsage notes\nThe following table shows which parameters are valid for each value of ACTION:\n.\nAction \nParameter ADD or REMOVE REMOVEALL\nREPLACE\nCHLAUTH X X X \nTYPE X X X \nCMDSCOPE X X X \nACTION X X X \nADDRESS X X\nADDRLIST X X \nCHCKCLNT X \nCLNTUSER X X \nMCAUSER X \nQMNAME X X \nSSLCERTI X X \nSSLPEER X X \nUSERLIST X X \nUSERSRC X \nWARN X \nDESCR X \n.\n+ end excerpt\n\n\nAdditional Search Words: uppercase lowercase upper lower case\n\n \n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n WMQ MQ MQSeries", "content_type": "text", "id": "swg21577138"}, "is_correct_answer": true, "is_correct_document": true, "origin": "gold-label", "answer": {"answer": "you MUST include the single quotes when specifying the value during an ACTION(REMOVE):"}, "no_answer": false}, {"query": "We have tablespaces defined under DB2 9.5 that apparently are not able\nto reclaim storage back to the OS, but does that mean DB2 cannot reuse\nthis space as well?", "document": {"content": "SQL1763N; Alter Tablespace; reclaimable storage; DMS; Automatic storage table spaces; MON_GET_TABLESPACE; RECLAIMABLE_SPACE_ENABLED; SMS; DB2 Version 9.7; lower high water mark TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n Receiving SQL1763N error with Reason Code 11 while running \"Alter Tablespace\" command to reclaim unused storage space against DMS or automatic storage tablespaces. \n\nSYMPTOM\nFollowing reasons apply: \n\n * If the DMS or automatic storage tablespaces are not created in DB2 Version 9.7 or later, as the \"Reclaimable Storage\" is not available in tablespaces created in earlier versions(V9.1/V9.5) of the DB2 product. \n * Trying to alter a SMS tablespace as this feature is not supported on SMS tablespaces. \n\n\nExample testcase on a TEMPSPACE1 SMS tablespace. \n\n * \n * \n * DB21034E The command was processed as an SQL statement because it was not a valid Command Line Processor command. During SQL processing it returned: SQL1763N Invalid ALTER TABLESPACE statement for table space \"TEMPSPACE1\" due to reason \"11\" SQLSTATE=429BC \n * \n   \n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nMON_GET_TABLESPACE table function and RECLAIMABLE_SPACE_ENABLED monitor element can be used to identify whether the tablespace is enabled for reclaimable storage or not. Example: \ndb2 \"SELECT varchar(tbsp_name, 30) as tbsp_name, tbsp_type, RECLAIMABLE_SPACE_ENABLED FROM TABLE(MON_GET_TABLESPACE('',-2))\" \n\n \n\nSnippet of the output: \n\n \n\nTBSP_NAME TBSP_TYPE RECLAIMABLE_SPACE_ENABLED\n----------------- ----------- -------------------------\nSYSCATSPACE DMS 1\nTEMPSPACE1 SMS 0\nUSERSPACE1 DMS 1 \n\nIf the RECLAIMABLE_SPACE_ENABLED monitor element returns a value of 1, then the tablespace is enabled for reclaimable storage. Otherwise, it returns a value of 0.\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nTo use the reclaimable storage feature, make sure to create the DMS or automatic storage tablespaces in DB2 Version 9.7 or later. Example testcase on SYSCATSPACE DMS tablespace which has reclaimable storage enabled. \n\n \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n\n\nNote: \nTablespaces migrated from DB2 V9.1/V9.5 to V9.7 won't get upgraded directly to use the reclaimable storage feature.

This should help address common issues with this component before calling IBM support and save you time. \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe following are some examples of common JSP problems and some basic information on how to resolve them: \n\n * java.io.FileNotFoundException: JSPG0036E: Failed to find resource\n   If the browser displays a JSPG0036E: Failed to find resource message, the JSP processor cannot find the specified JSP page in the Web module, as shown below.\n   \n   java.io.FileNotFoundException: JSPG0036F: Failed to find /Tests/index.jsp\n   at com.ibm.ws.jsp.webcontainerext.JSPExtensionProcessor.findWrapper (JSPExtensionProcessor.java:246)\n   at com.ibm.ws.jsp.webcontainerext.JSPExtensionProcessor.handleRequest (JSPExtentionProcessor.java:228)\n   ... \n   Take following steps to verify URL being requested order to debug this exception:\n   \n   To determine the URL of the installed application, you need to use the administrative console to view the configuration of a number of items. The format of the URL is as follows:\n   \n   http://host:port/context_root/resource_name \n   Finding <host>:<port>\n   When a Web module is installed, a virtual host is associated with it. To find the virtual host using the WebSphere Application Server administrative console:  1. Select Applications > Application type > WebSphere Enterprise Applications.\n       \n       \n    2. Select the application name to open the details page.\n       \n       In the Web module Properties section, click Virtual hosts.\n       \n       \n    3. Note the virtual hosts that are used by the specified application Web module.\n   \n   \n   To find the host and port numbers that are valid for the virtual host:  1. Select Environment > Virtual Hosts.\n       \n       \n    2. Choose the virtual host, and then under Additional Properties, click Host Aliases.\n       \n       \n    3. The list contains the host name and port combinations that can be used to access this virtual host. The host name column should contain values that are registered in a DNS server as a host name for the WebSphere Application Server. An asterisk (*) in the host column indicates that any name can be used. In this case, use the server host name.\n   \n   \n   Finding <context_root>\n   The context root is the Web application root and is used to identify the application in the URI. To find the context root:  1. In the WebSphere Application Server administrative console, click Applications > Application type > WebSphere Enterprise Applications.\n       \n       \n    2. Select the target application, then under Detail Properties, click View Deployment Descriptor.\n       \n       \n    3. Review the <context-root> tag for the specified Web module in the related deployment descriptor tag.\n   \n   \n   Finding <resource_name>\n   To find the initial file for the application (for example, index.jsp), you can look at the welcome file list in the Web deployment descriptor. As per J2EE specification, JSP files should reside under web module root or under sub directory other than META-INF and WEB-INF.\n   \n   For example:  * Web module root :\n      \n      install_root\\profiles\\profile_name\\installedApps<CELL>\\<EAR>\\<WAR> \n      \n   \n   In the preceding case, the index.jsp file should reside uner Web_module_root/Test directory. If not, than it explains this error message. \n   \n * JSP not reloading\n   If, after modifying and saving a JSP file, the change does not show up in the browser, you need to check the reload settings in the Web module configuration and the JSP runtime reload settings. For the JSPs, the Web container reloads a Web module only when the IBM extension reloadingEnabled in the ibm-web-ext.xmi file is set to true.\n   \n   The following is an example of web module reloading settings in the ibm-web-ext.xmi file:\n   \n   <webappext:WebAppExtension xmi:version=\"2.0\" xmlns:xmi=\"http://www.omg.org/XMI\" xmlns:webappext=\"webappext.xmi\" xmi:id=\"WebAppExtension_1109270589179\" reloadInterval=\"3\" reloadingEnabled=\"true\" fileServingEnabled=\"true\"> \n   Location of the ibm-web-ext.xmi file :\n   \n   install_root\\profiles\\profile_name\\config\\cells\\cell_name\n   \\applications\\<EAR>\\deployments\\app_name\\<WAR>\\WEB-INF\\ibm-web-ext.xmi \n   Configuring JSP runtime reloading:\n   You have the ability to modify the JSP processor behavior for different JSP stages (such as development, testing, or production environments). This done by configuring specific attributes in the IBM Web module extensions that affect the JSP runtime reload behavior.\n   \n   JSP files can be translated and compiled at runtime when the JSP file or its dependencies are modified. This is known as JSP reloading. JSP reloading is enabled through the reloadEnabled JSP engine parameter in the ibm-web-ext.xmi configuration file.\n   \n   The JSP engine settings are stored in the ibm-web.ext.xmi file, as shown \n   <jspAttributes xmi:id=\"JSPAttribute_1\" name=\"reloadEnabled\" value=\"true\"/>\n   <jspAttributes xmi:id=\"JSPAttribute_9\" name=\"reloadInterval\" value=\"3\"/> \n   \n * Encoding and internationalization issues\n   Encoding and internationalization problems usually showup as garbage characters in Web pages and input from user interpreted incorrectly. Double Byte Character Set (DBCS) character processing is a common issue for encoding problems. DBCS is used for languages such a Chinese, Korean, and Japanese, where a single byte is not sufficient to represent all characters in the alphabet. Proper coding and configuration usually resolves these problems. For JSP pages, page encoding is the character encoding in which the file is encoded. For JSP pages in standard syntax, the page encoding is determined from the following sources:  1. The pageEncoding attribute of the page directive of the page \n    2. The charset value of the contentType attribute of the page directive\n   \n   \n   If none of these is provided, ISO-8859-1 is used as the default page encoding.\n   \n   Page directive implementation in JSP code:\n   \n   <HTML>\n   <HEAD>\n   <%@ page language=\"java\" contentType=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" pageEncoding=\"ISO-8859-15\" %>\n   <META http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\n   <TITLE>Receiving parameters</TITLE>\n   </HEAD>\n   <BODY>\n   <H1>\n   Your data is <%= request.getParameter(\"name\") %>\n   </H1>\n   </BODY>\n   </HTML> \n   The pageEncoding and contentType attributes determine the page character encoding of only the file that physically contains the page directive. \n   \n * java.lang.IllegalStateException\n   This exception is thrown when attempt is made to modify HttpServletResponse object after it has been committed.\n   \n   If you have written something in the response buffer, you cannot forward a page:\n   \n   [7/8/05 20:36:25:694 ART] 0000004f ServletWrappe E SRVE0068E: Could not invoke the service() method on servlet TestServlet.

RequestDispatcher.forward() or performing jsp:forward\n   \n   \n   Two other common variants of this exception are: \n   java.lang.IllegalStateException: Header already sent \n   One or more headers have been committed to the client, so you cannot set that header again. \n   java.lang.IllegalStateException: OutputStream already obtained \n   In case of JSP, the default output stream has always been created when the JSP has been translated to servlet. Creating and associating another output stream is the reason for this problem. The following piece of code will describe the reason for this error condition: \n   try\n   {\n   lStream = pResponse.getOutputStream();\n   lStream.write(lDocument);\n   lStream.flush();\n   }\n   catch (java.io.IOException ioe)\n   {\n   logger.error(\"Exception writing ... to page output stream.\");\n   }\n   finally\n   {\n   try\n   {\n   if (lStream != null)\n   {\n   lStream.close();\n   }\n   }\n   catch (java.io.IOException ioe)\n   {\n   logger.error(\"Exception closing page output stream.\");\n   }\n   } \n   Two output streams cannot be associated with one JSP file. \n   \n\nWhat to do next \nIf the preceding troubleshooting steps did not help solve your problem, see the MustGather [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21255205] for JSP problems.  \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers Runtimes for Java Technology Java SDK", "content_type": "text", "id": "swg21282614"}, "is_correct_answer": true, "is_correct_document": true, "origin": "gold-label", "answer": {"answer": "java.lang.IllegalStateException\n   This exception is thrown when attempt is made to modify HttpServletResponse object after it has been committed."}, "no_answer": false}, {"query": "Getting Delay or AMQ9716: Remote SSL certificate revocation status check failed when trying to start a MQ SSL channel, please help resolve this? The error can occur on the MQ server or also a MQ client application..\n\nAMQ9716: Remote SSL certificate revocation status check failed\n\nRemote SSL certificate revocation status check failed for channel '???'.\n\nEXPLANATION: WebSphere MQ failed to determine the revocation status of the remote SSL\ncertificate for one of the following reasons:\n\n(a) The channel was unable to contact any of the CRL servers or OCSP responders for the certificate.\n(b) None of the OCSP responders contacted knows the revocation status of the certificate.\n(c) An OCSP response was received, but the digital signature of the response could not be verified.", "document": {"content": "AMQ9716 7.0.1.0 SSL OCSP SSL TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n You upgrade to WebSphere MQ 7.0.1.0 (or later) and have SSL enabled channels. After the upgrade you notice that in the Queue Manager error LOGs you see the following error message:\n\nAMQ9716: Remote SSL certificate revocation status check failed for channel '????'. \nThe channel does not start. \n\nSYMPTOM\nError AMQ9716\n\n\nCAUSE\nWith the release of WebSphere MQ V7.0.1.0 the use of OCSP certificate revocation checking was included. With this new feature, most likely your SSL certificates have a OCSP AuthorityInfoAccess (AIA) certificate extension embedded inside them. \n\n\nThis was ignored before V7.0.1.0. Now it is being used to verify the certificate. The most likely cause of the failure is that the system can not access the servers listed in the AIA. This then returns a UNKNOWN status when the check is done. The default action for MQ is to not allow the channel to start and the AMQ9716 to be reported when the UNKNOWN is returned.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe best thing to do in this case is to determine the cause of the UNKNOWN return code and fix it. \n\n\nThere are two possible methods to discover which OCSP AuthorityInfoAccess URL is embedded in a certificate. \n\nMethod 1.\nPlace the certificate on a Windows machine; ensure to use a file extension of \"crt\" and double-click it. View the detail extensions for the AIA. \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21399255&amp;aid=1]\n\nMethod 2\nUse IBM Key Management (gskit) GUI to view them. Issue the following command::\nIn Windows: strmqikm \nIn UNIX: gsk7ikm (MQ V7) or runmqckm (MQ V8)\n\nFrom the IBM Key Management window:\nSelect View/Edit for certificate\nView Details\nExtensions\nAuthorityInfoAccess\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21399255&amp;aid=2]\n\nThe first step would be to insure that connection to the URL in your certificate can be reached.\n\n\nWork-around:\nUse this only as a temporary fix until the root cause can be found.\nYou can do the following. It will still do OCSP checking and if REVOKED is returned then the channel will not start. A GOOD return code will allow the channel to start. If UNKNOWN is returned it will not stop the channel from starting and the AMQ9716 will not be reported.\n\nUNIX and Linux systems add the following to qm.ini\nSSL:\nOCSPAuthentication=OPTIONAL\n\nTo set for a Windows Queue Manager, run the following command:\namqmdain reg YourQMgrName -c add -s SSL -v OCSPAuthentication=OPTIONAL\n\nThe OCSPAuthentication setting is also applicable to clients and can also be set in the client ini file (e.g. mqclient.ini). Changes to the client OCSPAuthentication setting will take effect after the application is restarted.\n\nOn a queue manager, users will need to issue a REFRESH SECURITY TYPE(SSL) command (or the GUI/PCF equivalent) in order for the change in SSL settings to take effect.\n\nOCSP provides your SSL channels with additional security. Once the cause of the AMQ9716 error has been addressed then you are strongly recommended to re-enable OCSP enforcement\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n OCSP Info [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.1.0/com.ibm.mq.doc/sy13000_.htm?lang=en]\n\n\n \n\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\n WMQ MQ", "content_type": "text", "id": "swg21399255"}, "is_correct_answer": true, "is_correct_document": true, "origin": "gold-label", "answer": {"answer": "With the release of WebSphere MQ V7.0.1.0 the use of OCSP certificate revocation checking was included.

Continue with the uninstallation process. \n   \n   \n   \n * Windows: Attachment Manager Symptoms: \n   \n   If you are installing an IBM product by using an electronic image from IBM Passport Advantage, and you are using Windows XP Service Pack 2 or later, your Windows Security settings might cause Attachment Manager to block the content of the installer .zip file, causing your installation to fail. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   To work around this problem, complete the following steps: \n   \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * Properties\n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * General\n    * \n    * Unblock\n    * \n   \n   \n   For more information about Windows Attachment Manager, refer to the Microsoft Support site at: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/883260 [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/883260]\n   \n * HP-UX: Runtime component supplied on a physical DVD The installation image for the WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 GA runtime component has exceeded the 700 MB limit recommended for a physical CD. For this reason, the installation image for the HP-UX platform is supplied on a physical DVD rather than a physical CD. The installation image for the WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 GA runtime component is also available from the Passport Advantage website. For information about downloading WebSphere Message Broker Version V8.0 installation images from the Passport Advantage website, see the Download WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 from the Passport Advantage website download document, which is available at:\n   http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24030968 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24030968]\n   \n   \n   \n * Installing using the fix pack installer Symptoms: \n   \n   The WebSphere Message Broker V8.0.0.0 GA runtime installer requires that you accept the license agreement.\n   The fix pack installer requires either that you install on a system that already has WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 GA installed, or that you provide the original WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 GA license files. The WebSphere message Broker V8.0 GA license files can be from either an existing V8.0 runtime installation, or from the original V8.0 installation media. The location of the license files is required only when you are installing a WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 fix pack on a system on which an installation of WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 GA has not been detected. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   GUI or Console installations\n   For a fix pack GUI or console installation where V8.0 does not already exist on the system, the installer will prompt you to provide the path to existing media licenses or an existing installation of V8.0.\n   Where V8.0 is already installed on the system, you should not be prompted for existing licences, and the installation will progress as normal. \n   \n   Silent installations\n   For silent installations (full media or fixpack) you must always accept the license, so for example \n   \n   \n   For a full GA silent media installation\n   Add the argument: -DLICENSE_ACCEPTED=TRUE to your silent command, or to the response file you have referenced\n   For example on windows command line\n   setup32.exe -i silent -DLICENSE_ACCEPTED=TRUE\n   \n   For a fix pack silent installation where V8.0 already exists on the system\n   Add the argument: -DLICENSE_ACCEPTED=TRUE to your silent command, or to the silent response file you have referenced\n   For example on windows command line\n   8.0.0-WS-MB-WINIA32-FP0001.exe -i silent -DLICENSE_ACCEPTED=TRUE\n   \n   For a fix pack silent installation where V8.0 does not already exist on the system\n   Also add the argument: -DExternal_License_Path=<path to licenses> to your silent command, or to the silent response file you have referenced\n   For example on windows command line pointing at the original media in the D: drive\n   8.0.0-WS-MB-WINIA32-FP0001.exe -i silent -DLICENSE_ACCEPTED=TRUE -DExternal_License_Path=\"D:\\messagebroker_ia_runtime1\\license\n   \n   Note if pointing at an existing installation of V8.0.0.0 the path is subtly different\n   For example on windows command line pointing at the original media in the D: drive\n   8.0.0-WS-MB-WINIA32-FP0001.exe -i silent -DLICENSE_ACCEPTED=TRUE -DExternal_License_Path=\"C:\\Program Files\\IBM\\MQSI\\8.0.0.0\\license\\8.0.0.0\"\n   \n   \n\n\n\n * Instructions for installing the WebSphere Message Broker runtime and ODBC Database Extender components with a non-root user ID Symptoms: \n   \n   In the information center topic \"Security on Linux and UNIX systems\" (bh26031), steps 3d) and 3e) for installing the runtime and ODBC Database Extender (IE02) components with a non-root user ID are incorrect. If you follow the steps described in the topic, the product will not install correctly. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   Replace steps 3d) and 3e) in the topic with the following new steps 3d) to 3i):\n   \n   \n\n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  /opt/ibm/mqsi and /opt/ibm/IE02 (for Linux) For example: SUDO mkdir /opt/ibm/mqsi\n   SUDO mkdir /opt/ibm/IE02\n   \n   \n   /opt/IBM/mqsi and /opt/IBM/IE02 (for UNIX and AIX). For example:\n   SUDO mkdir /opt/IBM/mqsi\n   SUDO mkdir /opt/IBM/IE02 \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n\n\n\n\n\nTOP Platforms \n\nUbuntu WebSphere Message Broker is supported on Ubuntu, but only for development systems. Production systems should not be used to run WebSphere Message Broker on Ubuntu. \n\nFor more information, see the WebSphere Message Broker system requirements page. The WebSphere Message Broker system requirements web page is available at:\nhttp://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wbimessagebroker/requirements/ [http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wbimessagebroker/requirements/] \n\n\n * Unable to connect a node that has multiple output terminals to other nodes (116214) Symptoms \n   \n   When attempting to connect a node that has multiple output terminals to other nodes, a connection is not created. \n   \n   Solution \n   \n   To work around this problem, complete one of the following steps: \n   \n    *  Set the following environment variable: GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS=1 \n   \n   OR  *  Use a different window manager \n   \n   \n\nSolaris and HP-UX \n * Increase in bipbroker and DataFlowEngine memory footprint on Solaris and HP-UX platforms Symptoms \n   \n   When upgrading from 8.0.0.1 to 8.0.0.2, bipbroker and DataFlowEngine processes running on Solaris or HP platforms might consume an additional 204 MB of memory. This is caused by an increase in the default size of the ReservedCodeCacheSize parameter in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) used by the broker processes. This area of memory is related to the just-in-time compilation of Java classes and was increased by the JVM supplier in response to an increase in bug reports from third party products failing due to exhaustion of space in the code cache. \n   \n   Solution \n   \n   Customers should use the default value for this parameter, but if this causes unnecessary resource contention, the default can be reverted to its former value by exporting the following environment variable in the broker's profile prior to starting the broker: \n   \n    * \n    * \n   \n   \n\nAIX  * DataFlowEngine abend on AIX when resolving hostname  \n   \n   Symptoms\n   The DataFlowEngine process running on AIX may terminate on startup or during a deploy with the following call stack in the abend/core file: \n   calloc [] \n   getaddrinfo [] \n   Java_java_net_Inet6AddressImpl_lookupAllHostAddr \n   \n   Solution\n   Apply AIX equivalent APAR fix for IV95824.\n   Alternatively apply one of the following workarounds: \n   1) Specify hosts resolution order in /etc/netsvc.conf so that IPv4 is resolved first. For example: \n   hosts=local4,bind4 \n   2) Export the following environment variable setting: \n   IBM_JAVA_OPTIONS=-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true \n   \n   \n\n\n\n\n\nTOP Migration \n * Brokers running fix pack 8.0.0.2 with new function capability enabled cannot participate in a multiple-broker global cache with brokers running 8.0.0.1. Symptom: \n   \n   After upgrading to fix pack 8.0.0.2, cache catalog servers fail to start. All cache components report BIP7190 warnings. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   In 8.0.0.2, by default, each WebSphere eXtreme Scale server participating in the global cache starts with a domain name that is derived by the broker.\n   Previously in 8.0.0.1 the domain name for all servers in all embedded caches was an empty string. Servers in different domains cannot collaborate in the same grid.\n   Therefore, for a cache that spans more than one broker, you must enable the new capability for these brokers at the same time. \n   \n   Enable the new capability by using the -f parameter on the mqsichangebroker command. \n   \n   Brokers running fix pack 8.0.0.2 without new functionality enabled can still collaborate in the same grid as brokers running 8.0.0.1.\n   In this scenario, the servers running 8.0.0.2 will continue to use an empty string as the domain name, and will report a BIP7140 warning message to the system log with this information.\n   \n   \n\n\n\n\n\nTOP WebSphere Message Broker Explorer \n * Connecting to a queue manager requires a SHARECNV value that is greater than 0 To connect the WebSphere Message Broker Explorer to a queue manager to receive publications, the SHARECNV property on that queue manager's SVRCONN channel must have a value that is greater than 0. This value is required if you want to use the Broker Statistics or Broker Statistics Graph views in WebSphere Message Broker Explorer.\n   \n   \n\n\n\n\n\nTOP WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit \n * Reset the Broker Application Development perspective after migrating Symptom: \n   \n   After migrating the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit and its resources to V8.0, items might be displayed in the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit that are removed in V8.0; for example, previous toolkit options in menus. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   To resolve this problem, complete the following step: \n   \n    * \n    * Window > Reset Perspective\n    * \n   \n   \n   After the perspective is reset, menus and views are updated for Version 8.0.\n   \n * Migrating or importing resources to a WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit V8.0.0.0 or V8.0.0.1 workspace, might result in erroneous errors. Symptom: \n   \n   After migrating or importing WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit and its resources to V8.0.0.0 or V8.0.0.1, erroneous errors might be displayed in the Toolkit. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   With your V8.0.0.0 or V8.0.0.1 workspace open in the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit, select Project > Clean... > Clean all projects. The erroneous error messages are removed.\n   \n   \n   \n * Importing resources into a new workspace might require project clean Symptom: \n   \n   When you import resources into a new workspace, error messages might display after autobuild is complete. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   In the Broker Development view, select your projects and right-click Project > Clean to rebuild the projects. After the projects are cleaned, the error messages relating to the import are removed.\n   \n   \n   \n * Specifying a new workspace with mqsicreatebar might require project clean Symptom: \n   \n   When you run the mqsicreatebar command and specify a new workspace, error messages might display. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   Use the -cleanBuild option when running the mqsicreatebar command to clean the projects.\n   \n   \n   \n * DFDL topics in the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit are displayed in US English only Symptom: \n   \n   When using the information center that is included in the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit V8.0.0.0 GA, Data Format Description Language (DFDL) topics are displayed in US English only.\n   These topics have the identifier \"dfxxxxx_\", where \"xxxxx\" is a five-digit number. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   This problem is fixed in WebSphere Message Broker version 8.0.0.1.\n   \n   Users of WebSphere Message Broker version 8.0.0.0 GA can view these topics, in a language other than US English, using the online product documentation. The online product documentation for WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 contains the latest translated documentation, and is available at: \n   \n   http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKM8N_8.0.0/mapfiles/help_home_msgbroker.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKM8N_8.0.0/mapfiles/help_home_msgbroker.html]\n   \n   \n   \n * Java, PHP, and Message Set projects having the same name can only belong to one Application or Library Symptom: \n   \n   If a customer has more than one application or library in their workspace which requires a Java, PHP, or Message Set projects having the same name, an error message similar to the following will appear:\n   The project < Project Name > can not be a member of multiple applications or libraries.... \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   Where an identical project is required in more than one application or library, a copy of the project should be made, and given a different name.\n   \n   \n   \n * Documentation contains incorrect instructions for installing the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit as a non-admin user Symptom: \n   \n   Non-admin user is not able to install Toolkit while following current installation documentation. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   This problem is fixed in WebSphere Message Broker version 8.0.0.1.\n   \n   Users of WebSphere Message Broker 8.0.0.0, who are installing Toolkit as a non-admin user, can refer to the online product documentation at [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmbhelp/v8r0m0/index.jsp]http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKM8N_8.0.0/mapfiles/help_home_msgbroker.html [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKM8N_8.0.0/mapfiles/help_home_msgbroker.html], or \n   \n   \n * Step 5 of the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit V8.0.0.0 installation documentation should be updated as follows:  * \n    * \n    *  On Windows run the following command: <disk1 image>\\installToolkit.bat -nonAdmin On Linux run the following script: <disk1 image>/installToolkit.sh -nonAdmin \n   \n   \n * Step 14 should be added to the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit V8.0.0.0 installation documentation and read as follows:  * \n    * \n    *  On Windows run command: <WMBT80_Home>\\wmbt\\postconfig\\postInstall_admin.bat On Linux run script: <WMBT80_Home>/wmbt/postconfig/postInstall_admin.sh \n    * \n   \n   \n * When using an application project and a subflow with a .msgflow extension it is possible to create a BAR file with a duplicate message flow if the sub-flows have been used incorrectly in the previous release. Symptom: \n   \n   This is caused when an External InputNode is added to the sub-flow; the resultant BAR file will contain two compiled message flows. One of the message flows will be the intended flow with the sub-flow embedded, the other message flow will be the extraneous sub-flow containing the ExternalInputNode without an appropriate ExternalOutput Node. \n   \n   When the BAR file is deployed both of the message flows will run. The sub-flow will incorrectly start a new thread and attempt to read data from the InputNode. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   Either : \n   \n    * \n    * \n    * \n   \n   \n   \n * Launching the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit from Installation Manager makes the toolkit use WebSphere MQ 7.0.1 Symptom: \n   \n   When an installation has completed, the user is provided the option to start the WebSphere Message Broker V8.0 Toolkit. When the toolkit opens, any broker which is running with a queue manager on WebSphere MQ version 7.1 or 7.5 will be reported as stopped, irrespective of whether the broker is running or not. A dialogue might be displayed warning the brokers can not be connected to. \n   \n   If a user tries to start one of the brokers which is stopped, an error message is displayed containing the following text: \n   \n   The queue manager '<QueueManager>' is not running (MQ reason code 2059 while trying to connect) \n   \n   Check that: \n   \n    * \n    * \n    * \n   \n   If a user tries to start one of the brokers which is already started, a dialogue is displayed indicating that the broker can not be started as it is already running. Solution: \n   \n   Shut down the toolkit and re-open it using the toolkit installation and not by using Installation Manager.\n   \n   \n   \n * A version of XULRunner which is not compatible with Eclipse 3.6 (upon which WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit is based) may cause the Linux toolkit to crash shortly after being launched. Symptom: \n   \n   Within a minute or so of launching the Linux toolkit, it crashes with the following error:\n   JVM terminated - Exit code=160 \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   Install a version of XULRunner which is compatible with Eclipse 3.6. \n   \n   Compatible versions of XULRunner are versions 1.8-3.6 and associated fix packs. \n   \n   Testing at IBM has been done using the following version, and this has been confirmed to resolve the issue:\n   http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/1.9.2.19/runtimes/xulrunner-1.9.2.19.en-US.linux-i686.tar.bz2 [http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/1.9.2.19/runtimes/xulrunner-1.9.2.19.en-US.linux-i686.tar.bz2] \n   \n   Expand the downloaded compressed file into a convenient directory ( e.g. /usr/lib/xulrunner_new) \n   \n   Add the following line to the eclipse.ini file under the mb install directory:\n   -Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.XULRunnerPath=<location of unzipped download> ( e.g. -Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.XULRunnerPath=/usr/lib/xulrunner_new)\n   \n   \n\n\n\n\n\nTOP Web Services \n * No known issues.\n\n\n\n\nTOP Web UI \n * Upload of WSDL on zOS in the Web UI is not supported On WebSphere Message Broker version 8.0.0.1 on zOS, you can not currently upload WSDL files using the Web UI for use in the Web Based Static Endpoint pattern.\n   \n   \n\n\n\n\n\nTOP Nodes  * After applying fixpack containing APAR IT01950 error BIP2503 is received.\n\n * \n * Symptoms:\n * WebSphere Message Broker has been modified so that if ESQL containing a FOR statement which iterates over a SHARED ROW variable contains a PROPAGATE statement within the FOR block then any attempt to write to that shared variable will result in an exception BIP2503 \"Propagate with a SHARED variable lock held by FOR statement\" being thrown.\n   \n   The reason for this is that while iterating over a SHARED ROW variable a lock is held on the variable, this lock is also obtained when writing to the variable in downstream nodes and the exact timing of these operations could result in a deadlock occurring. It is not valid to modify the SHARED ROW variable being iterated over in downstream nodes as it may invalidate the loop therefore behavior has been changed to throw an exception instead of deadlocking.\n   \n   Solution: \n * This means that there may be some flows which were at risk of deadlocking which now throw an exception. The recommended action is to modify the flows so that they do not use the affected invalid pattern however if this is not possible the previous behavior can be restored by setting the environment variable MQSI_ALLOW_PROPAGATE_WITH_SHARED_LOCK_HELD=1 and restarting the Broker.\n\n\n\n\nTOP WebSphere Adapter nodes \n * Saving Enterprise Metadata Discovery (EMD) adapter connection information during iterative discovery Symptoms: \n   \n   During WebSphere Adapter for SAP Software Enterprise Metadata Discovery (EMD) iterative discovery, the Adapter Connection wizard Service Generation and Deployment Configuration panel is displayed and can be edited; however, any adapter system connection information that you enter is not saved in the adapter component. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   Use the WebSphere Adapters editor to change the adapter system connection information to ensure that subsequent EMD iterative discoveries preserve the adapter system connection information: \n   \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * Open With\n    * \n    * WebSphere Adapters editor\n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n   \n   \n   \n * Assured delivery option for JDEdwards is not supported Symptoms: \n   \n   The JDE inbound adapter fails to deploy if the assured delivery check box is selected in the adapter wizard. The following error is issued: \n   \n   An attempt to set the property 'AssuredOnceDelivery' on adapter component 'AssuredDeliveryMSApp.IBM WebSphere Adapter for JD Edwards EnterpriseOne' failed because the property is not supported. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   This functionality is not currently supported, and should not be used in message flow development.\n   \n   \n\n\n\n\n\nTOP Graphical Data Mapper \n * Using a graphical data map to map input data that is retrieved from a database uses the default database schema name specified for the configured JDBC connection identity Symptoms: \n   \n   Using a graphical data map to map input data that is retrieved from a database is dependent on the default schema name configuration of your database server. The broker does not currently provide a facility to override the database schema name to be used in the SQL statements issued against the database. Currently, the SQL statement issued by the map includes only the database and table name but not a schema name. As a result, your database server uses the default database schema name for the identity that the broker used to connect to it while running the map. The connection identity that the broker uses is configured in a broker JDBCProvider configurable service. The JDBCProvider configurable service used is selected by the data source name in the map. \n   \n   If the required database table is not available in this schema, the map execution fails with a broker error containing specific error codes for your database server. For example:\n   BIP3947E: The map processing for QName '{maps}:RDB_Mapping' has failed, with the following details:\n   '{Your specific database schema table access error message and codes}' \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   This restriction is addressed in WebSphere Message Broker version 8.0.0.1, and later, through provision of the capability to optionally override the name of the database schema. For more information, see JDBCProviders configurable service [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKM8N_8.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/an60170_.htm] property \"databaseSchemaNames\". \n   \n   Users of WebSphere Message Broker version 8.0 GA should ensure that the table being selected from the graphical data map is available in the schema that is set by your database server for the database connection identity that is configured in the JDBCProvider configurable service. This is particularly restrictive on z/OS.\n   \n   \n   \n * Errors occur during runtime execution of newly created graphical data maps, that were converted from message map (.msgmap) files, or utilise certain extended capabilities such as submaps with multiple inputs, or xs:<type> cast transforms Symptoms: \n   \n   The execution of a graphical data map created using WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit version 8.0.0.2 that is deployed to a WebSphere Message Broker Runtime version 8.0 or 8.0.0.1 fails. \n   \n   Example error messages: \n   \n   BIP2230E: Error detected whilst processing a message in node '<node label>' ComIbmMSLMappingNode: <flow name>\n   BIP3946E: The map script generation for QName '<map routine name>' has failed, with the following details: java.lang.RuntimeException: IXJXE0609E: [ERR 0548][ERR XPST0017] The function '<function name>' with parity '<n>' is not in the in-scope function declarations. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   Update the WebSphere Message Broker runtime to version 8.0.0.2.\n   \n   \n   \n * Errors are seen during runtime when using a complex Data Analysis generated GDM map. Symptoms: \n   \n   A JVM Out of Memory exception is seen at runtime when using a Data Analysis generated GDM Map \n   \n   When using complex XML structures more memory is required that the default JVM Heap size \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   Use the mqsichangeproperties [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSKM8N_8.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/an09143_.htm] command to increase the maximum heap size to greater than 256Mb. For example : mqsichangeproperties MB8BROKER -e default -o ComIbmJVMManager -n jvmMaxHeapSize -v 786432000\n   \n   \n\n\n\n\n\nTOP Commands \n * Calling mqsiprofile in a zsh shell exits the session (A63403) Symptoms: \n   \n   On UNIX systems that use Z shell (zsh) as the shell environment, a call to 'source {install path}/mqsiprofile' causes the shell to exit. Due to the default behavior of zsh, the mqsiprofile command checks an incorrect argument number to determine whether it is being sourced, or run directly. The mqsiprofile script then prints a warning message and calls exit, but zsh interprets this call as an instruction to exit the current shell. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   To work around this problem, complete the following step: \n   \n    * In the UNIX terminal, call 'unsetopt function_argzero', then call the mqsiprofile command again.\n   \n   \n   \n * Documentation for mqsiapplybaroverride states support for -k and -y parameters Symptom: \n   \n   Information center topic an19545_ mqsiapplybaroverride describes parameters -k and -y for use with applications and libraries. Using these parameters with the command results in the following error:\n   BIP1033E Invalid parameters \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   These options are not supported with this command, and should not be used.\n   \n   \n   \n * Error \"AMQ7027: Argument [QM Name] supplied to command [path]\\crtmqm.exe is invalid.\" is seen when running mqsicreatebroker to create a Domain aware HA Broker on the Windows platform Symptom: \n   \n   An AMQ7027 error message might be returned from mqsicreatebroker when creating an HA Broker on the Windows platform when using the new -B or -Q flags if the Queue Manager does not already exist. \n   \n   Solution: \n   \n   If a Queue Manager does not exist when creating an HA Broker on Windows using the new -B or -Q flags an attempt is made to create a Queue Manager. The mqsicreatebroker command run tries to pass the '-ar' flag to the create Queue Manager (crtmqm) command. \n   \n   However, this option is only available for V7.1.0.3 and V7.5.0.1 of MQ. MQ APAR IC85940 provided this function in the Fix Packs. \n   \n   There are two possible workarounds in this situation: \n   \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n   \n   \n\n\n\n\nTOP Databases \n * Dates inserted into a Microsoft SQLServer database using JDBC are 2 days out \n * \n   Symptoms :\n   After upgrading to WebSphere Message Broker 8.0.0.7 or above, or applying APAR IT03599 to an earlier Fix Pack installation, dates inserted into an SQLServer database using a JDBC connection either through a JavaCompute node or a mapping node are 2 days out.\n   WebSphere Message Broker 8.0.0.7 and APAR IT03599 upgrade the level of Java used by the Broker to Java 1.7. Some versions of the Microsoft SQL JDBC driver do not support Java 1.7 and produce unexpected behaviour when used.\n   \n   Solution:\n   Upgrade the version of the Microsoft SQL JDBC driver to a version which supports Java 1.7\n   \n * User databases on z/OS Customers using user databases on z/OS require DB2 APAR PK99362.\n   \n   \n   \n * Sybase globally coordinated ('XA') transactions Globally coordinated ('XA') transactions are not supported.\n   \n   \n   \n * JDBC/XA globally coordinated ('XA') transactions JDBC/XA globally coordinated ('XA') transactions are supported on DB2 and Oracle (except Oracle RAC) on all broker platforms except HP-UX on Itanium and z/OS. \n   \n   ODBC XA and JDBC/XA can not be mixed on the same broker.\n   \n   \n   \n * Informix globally coordinated ('XA') transactions Informix globally coordinated ('XA') transactions are not supported.\n   \n   \n   \n * DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server support on Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 64-bit Only DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server are supported on Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 64-bit.

The client accepts a handshake using an ephemeral ECDH ciphersuite with the server key exchange message omitted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to launch further attacks on the system.\nCVSS Base Score: 1.2\nCVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99705 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99705] for the current score\nCVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined\nCVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) \n\n \n\nCVEID: CVE-2015-0204 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0204]\nDESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in the OpenSSL ssl3_get_key_exchange function could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain TLS connections. An OpenSSL client accepts the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. \n\nThis vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack. \n\nCVSS Base Score: 4.3\nCVSS Temporal Score: See http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99707 [http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/99707] for the current score\nCVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined\nCVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) \n\n \n\nCVEID: CVE-2015-0205 [http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0205]\nDESCRIPTION: OpenSSL could allow a remote authenticated attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the acceptance of a DH certificate for client authentication without verification.

After a successful handshake, the MQ protocol exchanges communications flows to negotiate channel startup, this processing detects an export ciphersuite being used where a stronger level of ciphersuite is required. In this scenario, the channel does not exchange any messages and logs an AMQ9631 error in the queue manager error logs before ending the connection. \n\n \n\nIBM Mobile Messaging and M2M Client Pack\nThe C client libraries provided by the MA9B Support Pac can also be rebuilt from source and linked against a newer maintenance level of OpenSSL 1.0.1 using the following instructions [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r5/topic/com.ibm.mm.tc.doc/tc10155_.htm].

read+execute permission\nto the agent OS user.\n\nAPAR : IV14403\nAbstract : TABLESPACE PERCENT_FREE_TO_MAX CALCULATE WRONG\nAdditional Information: The Oracle Database Extended agent might calculate \nthe value of the Percent_Free_To_Max attribute incorrectly, because this value\nshould be greater than the value of the Percent_Free_To_Allocated attribute\nin case the Oracle tablespace is set with Autoextend ON and \nthe maximum file size of the data file is greater than the allocated size \nfor the current datafile.\n\n6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0002\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nAPAR: IV08618\nAbstract : AGENT OCCUPY ORACLE SESSION MORE AND MORE\nAdditional Information: The Oracle Database Extended agent occupies the\nOracle sessions increasingly if the Oracle Database Extended agent user\ndoes not have all authorities in the krzgrant.sql file.\nThis increase is caused by the agent not disconnecting from the Oracle\ndatabase, with an error message of \"ORA-00942 Table or View does not\nexist,\" and the agent trying to reconnect to the Oracle database with a new\nsession in each interval.\n\nDefect: 167731\nAbstract: agent configure still load based version xml file.\nAdditional Information: A new rz_dd_063100002.xml file is\ninstalled in the itmhome\\config directory by this patch, \nwhere the base version of the rz_dd_063100000.xml file is installed.\n\nThe agent loads the configuration definition from the newly installed\nrz_dd_063100002.xml file instead of the base version file.\n\nDefect: 168694\nAbstract: cannot ignore Oracle Listener/Net Service definition.\nAdditional Information: A new KRZ_LOAD_ORACLE_NET environment variable \nis added so you can decide whether the Listener and Net Service End Points\nfrom the files below are required for monitoring.\n\nOn UNIX and Linux systems:\n$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/listener.ora\n$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora\n$TNS_ADMIN/network/admin/listener.ora\n$TNS_ADMIN/network/admin/tnsnames.ora\n\nOn Windows

variable is set to 'false', the agent\ndoes not load Listener or Net Service definitions from the files above,\neven if the agent is configured with ORACLE HOME directory.\n\nThe agent still loads Listener or Net Service definition if the agent\nis configured with a TNS PATH directory, which contains the\nlistener.ora or tnsnames.ora files.\n\nDefect: 168966\nAbstract: ASM disk/diskgroup display redundancy data.\nAdditional Information: In an Oracle RAC environment, if there is more\nthan one active ASM database instance, the agent queries back multiple\nrows for each disk or disk group in all active instances.\nIf there is a situation in monitoring the attributes such as \nKRZ_RDB_ASM_DISKGROUP.Free_Percent, there are\nduplicated alerts by this type of situation.\n\nThe agent queries back only one record for each disk or disk group, and \navoids the duplicated alert for the situation.\n\nThe following attribute groups are impacted by this fix:\n\nKRZ_RDB_ASM_DISKGROUP\nKRZ_RDB_ASM_DISK\nKRZ_ASM_DISK\nKRZ_ASM_DISKGROUP\n\nDefect: 168967\nAbstract: FreeToMax return negative value. \nAdditional Information: The agent gets a negative value or over 100% on the\nfollowing attributes because the Maximum file size of an Oracle\ndata file is less than the real data file

CANNOT MERGE CUSTOM SQL FOR BASETABLE \nAdditional Information: Use the KRZ_CUSTOM_SQLXML environment variable \nto specify a customized\nkrzsql_custom.xml file where the new SQLInfo is defined and the agent\nuses SQLInfo from the customized sql xml file instead of the \ndefault krzsql.xml file. There is a new BaseTable tag in\nthe SQLInfo from version 6.3.1 and the new definition of\nBaseTable cannot overwrite the default definition in the krzsql.xml file.\n\n<SQLInfo ID=\n...\n</SQLText>\n<BaseTable QueryName=\"SampleTable1\" GrantName=\"SampleTable1\"/>\n</SQL>\n\nIf you do not grant all tables and views to the Oracle Database Extended agent \nuser in the krzgrant.sql file, error messages are displayed about ORA-00942\nbecause the agent checks the Oracle authority on the QueryName element \nwhile the agent runs continuously.\n\nThe error message about ORA-00942 can be avoided by using a customized\nsql xml file and copying the SQLInfo definition from the default krzsql.xml \nfile and replacing the QueryName and GrantName with 'dual'.\n\n<SQLInfo ID=\n...\n</SQLText>\n<BaseTable QueryName=\"dual\" GrantName=\"dual\"/>\n</SQL>\n\nDefect: 172695\nAbstract: KRZCLIENT LOG FILE LOOP AND OVERWRITE FIRST ONE \nAdditional Information: The RAS1 log file for the \nkrzstart or krzclient processes loops between 01, 02, and 03. The\nfirst RAS1 log file is overwritten after the 3rd one \nis full. This action disenables you to see information, such as \nstart time during agent startup.\n\nAfter the application of the fix, in the following file examples\nthe RAS1 log message loops between the \n\"tivp56_rz_orcl_krzclient_4eef1fe8-02.log\" file and the \n\"tivp56_rz_orcl_krzclient_4eef1fe8-03.log\" file.

The default value\nfor CANDLEHOME is '/opt/IBM/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\\ibm\\itm'\non Windows systems.\n\n- If you have customized the Extended Monitoring Agent for Oracle \nrz.ini file on a UNIX system, back up this file before installing the fix. \nAfter this fix is installed, edit the latest rz.ini file and merge \nyour modifications into this rz.ini file.\n\n\n5.2 Local agent install and update (including silent installation)\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file to a \ntemporary directory on the system that contains the agent code to be \nupdated. For the purpose of this README, the <TEMP> symbol represents \nthe fully qualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter. \n\n2. Expand the archive file by using the tar command on UNIX systems or \nan unzip utility on Windows systems. This expansion creates a directory \nstructure that contains fixes for all supported platforms.\n\n3. Use the procedures in the \"IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Version 6.2.2\nInstallation and Setup Guide\" to install the agent.\n\n4. Use the procedures in the specific database monitoring agent user's\nguide to complete the installation and configuration.\n\n\n5.3 Remote agent update and installation\n----------------------------------------\n1. Make sure that all potential targets of the remote deployment are\nrunning version 6.2.2 Fix Pack 2 or later of the OS monitoring \nagent.\n2. Transfer the appropriate archive file to \na temporary directory on the Tivoli Enterprise \nMonitoring Server system. For the purpose of this README, the \n<TEMP> symbol represents the fully qualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter. \n\n3. Expand the archive file by using the tar command on UNIX systems or an \nunzip utility on Windows systems. This expansion creates a directory structure\nthat contains fixes for all supported operating systems.\n\n4. To add the fix pack bundles to the remote deployment depot, use the\ntacmd addBundles command found in $CANDLEHOME/bin on UNIX systems\nor in %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin on Windows systems. For more information\nabout the tacmd addBundles command, see the \"IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring Command Reference.\"\n\nOn a UNIX system: if the fix was expanded to \n<TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>:\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>/WINDOWS/Deploy -t rz -f\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>/WIA64/Deploy -t rz -f\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>/unix -t rz -f \n\nwhere:\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be\nadded to the depot.\n-t is the product code of the product to add, in this case rz \nrepresents the Extended Monitoring Agent for Oracle Database\n-f performs the actions without asking for confirmation\n\nOn a Windows system: if the fix was expanded to \n<TEMP>/<PARTNUMBER>:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>\\<PARTNUMBER>\\WINDOWS\\Deploy -t rz -f\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>\\<PARTNUMBER>\\WIA64\\Deploy -t rz -f\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>\\<PARTNUMBER>\\unix -t rz -f \n\nwhere:\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be\nadded to the depot. \n-t is the product code of the product to add, in this case rz \nrepresents the Extended Monitoring Agent for Oracle Database\n-f performs the actions without asking for confirmation\n\n5. To login to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server and deploy\nthe fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use\nthe following tacmd commands. For more information about the\ntacmd login and updateAgent commands, see the \"IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring Command Reference.\"\n\nOn a UNIX system: \n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the managed system name for the OS agent on the \nremote system to be updated.

Use this value as the target of the\ntacmd updateAgent command. \n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd updateAgent -t RZ\n-n <Managed system name>\n-v 063102000\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the updateAgent command is specified as \ntwo characters (rz), not three characters (krz).\n- The node (-n) for the updateAgent command is the managed system\nname of the operating system (OS) agent to be updated. The \ntarget node for an updateAgent command is always an OS agent.\n\n- The following error might occur with the updateAgent command on \nLinux and UNIX endpoints; however, the agent is successfully \nupdated. This error does not occur on Windows endpoints.\n\nKUICUA011I: Updating the rz agents.\nKUICUA015E: The updateAgent command did not complete because an\nerror occurred. Refer to the following error\nreturned from the server:\n\nThe monitoring server encountered an error while updating the\nmanaged system type.\n\nThe kuiras1.log file might provide more information about \nthis error. If you require further assistance to resolve the \nerror, contact IBM Software Support.\n\nA timeout occurred while waiting for an agent task to complete on\n{node name}.\n\nThe agent task did not complete within the configured \ntime out period.\n\nVerify that the target system is online. Increase the \ntime out value and try the operation again.\n\n\n\n5.4 Agent support update\n------------------------\nFix 6.3.1-TIV-ITM_EXT-FP0001 included changes to the agent\nsupport files that must be installed. If you have already\ninstalled these updates, there are no additional installation\nsteps. Otherwise, use the following steps to update the Tivoli\nEnterprise Monitoring Server, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or\nTivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop.\n\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file \nto the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Servers, IBM Tivoli\nEnterprise Portal Servers, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal desktops. \n\n2. Expand the archive file using the tar command on UNIX systems or an \nunzip utility on Windows systems. \n\n3. Use the procedures in the \"IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Version 6.2.2\nInstallation and Setup Guide.\"\n\n4. Use the procedures in the specific database monitoring agent user's\nguide to complete the installation and configuration.\n\n5. If the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server being updated is remote (not a \nHub Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server) then restart the Tivoli Enterprise \nMonitoring Server.\n\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n========================================\n\n6.1 Verifying the update\n------------------------\n1. To verify that the agent was updated correctly, use the tacmd command to \nview the current version of the agent. You are required to log in \nto a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server before you view the agent\nversion. \n\nFor example:\nOn a UNIX system, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring\ninstallation directory, the default location is '/opt/IBM/ITM'. \n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t rz\n\nOn a Windows system, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis 'C:\\ibm\\itm'. \n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t RZ \n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is \n06.31.02.00\n\nNote:\nThe component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is specified \nas two characters (RZ), not three characters (KRZ).\n\n2.

These SQLs are executed only if there is a situation or \nyou click \"Link to SQL Result\" in the workspace \"Customized SQLs ->\nRDB Customized SQL Summary Definition\".\n\n- Problem: agent environment variable or error trace level do not take\neffective.\n- Workaround: If you must edit an environment variable such as setting a new\nerror trace level, the new variable must be modified in both the \ninstalldir/config/rz.ini file and the installdir/config/rz_<instance>.config\nfile, and you must restart agent.\n\n- Problem: agent report ORA-00942 error message in the log files like\nfollowing. Oracle Database Server is 10.1.0.2.\nERROR at line 1:\nORA-00942: table or view does not exist\nORA-06512: at line 128\n- Workaround: Run the krzgrant.sql script in 6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-FP0001 to resolve\nthis error.\n\n- Problem: tacmd listsystems command does not display proper version\nfor offline agent's subnode.\nFor subnode e.g. RZ:HOSTNAME-INSTANCE-CONNECTION:RDB, version is\ndisplaying as 06.31.01.XX, Status is 'N'.\n- Workaround: Check the version from the root node of the agent to get the correct\nversion, for example, for INSTANCE:HOSTNAME:RZ, the version is displayed as \n06.31.01.00. \n\n- Problem: After upgrading to Fix Pack 2 and configuring the Oracle\nDatabase Extended agent silently, the agent cannot\nconnect to the database, which is specified by the\nKRZ_CONN_STR parameter in the silent configuration\nresponse file.\n- Workaround: The KRZ_CONN_TYPE parameter specifies the connection\ntype. The Advanced type is required to configure a\ndatabase connection with the KRZ_CONN_STR\nconnection string. For example:\n\nKRZ_CONN_STR.connection=//host:port/service\nKRZ_CONN_TYPE.connection=Advanced\n\nTo solve the problem, update the silent configuration\nresponse file to specify the KRZ_CONN_TYPE parameter and\nreconfigure the agent instance silently. For example:\n\n# cat /tmp/silent_config.txt\n############ PRIMARY TEMS CONFIGURATION ############\nCMSCONNECT=YES\nHOSTNAME=tivp055.cn.ibm.com\nNETWORKPROTOCOL=ip.pipe\nIPPIPEPORTNUMBER=1918\n############ Database connection config ############\nINSTANCE=inst1\nKRZ_CONN_USERID=tivoli\nKRZ_CONN_PASSWORD=password\nKRZ_INSTANT_CLIENT_LIBPATH=/opt/IBM/oci\nKRZ_DYNAMIC_LISTENER=FALSE\n###\nKRZ_CONN_STR.asm=//tivx010:1521/+ASM\nKRZ_CONN_USERID.asm=sys\nKRZ_CONN_PASSWORD.asm=oracle\nKRZ_CONN_MODE.asm=SYSDBA\nKRZ_CONN_TYPE.asm=Advanced\n\n# /opt/IBM/ITM/bin/itmcmd config -A -o inst1\n-p /tmp/silent_config.txt rz\n\n- Problem: The Oracle Database Extended agent reports the error\nmessage ORA-03135: connection lost contact and the\nsubnode that represents the monitored database\nconnection is still offline in the Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nafter the monitored database recovers to active status..\n- Workaround: The Oracle Database might disconnect all active connections\nand reject new connections under certain circumstances.\nAn example is when resources such as CPU are exhausted\nin the Oracle Server.\nTo solve the problem, ensure that the Oracle Database\nand Oracle Listener are open to the new connection and\nrestart the agent instance.\n\n- Problem: After you upgrade to V6.3.1 Fix Pack 2, the subnode ID\nis truncated from 25 characters to 24 characters. The\noriginal subnode with 25 characters changes to gray, and\nthe new subnode with 24 characters is displayed.\n- Workaround: This behavior is expected. In 6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0001\nor later versions, the agent changed the maximum\nsubnode ID from 25 characters to 24 characters to avoid\nthe following problem, which is a known APAR for IBM\nTivoli Monitoring V6.2.2 Fix Pack 4: \"pure event cannot\nfire when subnode name length is equal to or greater\nthan 32 characters.\"\nTo avoid truncation of the subnode from 25 characters to\n24 characters, use one of the following two options:\n\nOption 1: Set the following variable to a value of 25 in\nthe agent environment variable files:\nKRZ_MAX_SUBNODE_ID_LENGTH=25. After you upgrade,\nthe default value is 24.\nNote:\n- On UNIX or Linux operating systems, the\nenvironment variable files include\ninstalldir/config/rz.ini and installdir/config/\nrz_instance.config.\n- On Windows operating systems, the environment\nvariable files include installdir\\TMAITM6\\\nKRZENV_instance (32-bit) or installdir\\\nTMAITM6_X64\\KRZENV_instance (64-bit).\n\nOption 2: Reduce the length of the database\nconnection name, agent instance name, or host name;\nor, see Changing default naming conventions for\ndatabase connections in the Installation and\nConfiguration Guide for the Oracle Database Extended\nagent for information.\n\n8.0 Additional product information\n==================================\nNone.\n\n\n9.0 Notices\n===========\nThis information was developed for products and services offered \nin the United States.

Although these connections will eventually be discarded through the normal processing of the connection requests, it may be desirable to purge them all at once and allow the pool to refill with new, valid connections.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nWebSphere Application Server has an operation on the data source MBean that can be used to purge the connection pool. WebSphere Application Server MBean may be called via the wsadmin console, see the IBM Information Center topic \"Scripting the application serving environment (wsadmin)\" for more details. The operation name is: purgePoolContents. \n\nThe purgePoolContents operation has two options: \n\n 1. Normal:  * This is the default option. \n     * Existing in-flight transactions will be allowed to continue work. \n     * Shared connection requests will be honored. \n     * Free connections are cleaned up and destroyed. \n     * In use connections (for example: connections in transactions) are cleaned up and destroyed when returned to the connection pool. \n     * A close() call issued on any connection obtained prior to the purgePoolContents will be done synchronously (for example: wait for the jdbc driver to return before proceeding). \n     * Requests for new connections (not handles to existing old connections) will be honored.\n       \n       \n    \n    \n 2. Immediate:  * No new transactions will be allowed to start on any connections obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call. Instead, a StaleConnectionException is thrown. \n     * No new handles will be handed out on any connections obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call. Instead, a StaleConnectionException is thrown. \n     * Existing in-flight transactions will be allowed to continue work. Any new activities on a purged Connection will cause a StaleConnectionException or an XAER_FAIL exception (in the case of XA) \n     * A close() call issued on any connection obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call will be done asynchronously (for example: no waiting for the jdbc driver to return) This is useful if the driver returns. \n     * Due to the fact that close() does not wait, the number of connections will be decremented immediately in WebSphere Application Server. This might cause the total number of connections in WebSphere Application Server to be temporarily out of sync with the database total number of connections. \n     * Requests for new connections (for example: not handles to existing old connections) will be honored.\n    \n    \n\n\nExamples of operations that can be executed on the data source MBean using the wasdmin console:  1. List all data sources:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl queryNames *:type=DataSource,*\n    \n    Using Jython:\n    AdminControl.queryNames(\"*:type=DataSource,*\")\n    \n    \n 2. Initialize a variable to specify a data source (this example uses Default Datasource, but any data source name listed in the output of above command can be used):\n    Using Jacl:\n    set name \"Default Datasource\"\n    set ds [$AdminControl queryNames *:type=DataSource,name=$name,*] \n    \n    Using Jython:\n    name = \"Default Datasource\"\n    ds = AdminControl.queryNames(\"*:type=DataSource,name=\"+name+\",*\") \n    \n    \n 3. View the pool contents by invoking the showPoolContents operation of the data source MBean:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl invoke $ds showPoolContents\n    \n    Using Jython:\n    print AdminControl.invoke(ds, \"showPoolContents\")\n    \n    \n 4. View contents of all pools by invoking the showAllPoolContents operation of the data source MBean:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl invoke $ds showAllPoolContents\n    \n    \n    Using Jython:\n    print AdminControl.invoke(ds, \"showAllPoolContents\")\n    \n    \n 5. Immediately purge the pool by invoking the purgePoolContents operation of the data source MBean with the immediate option:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl invoke $ds purgePoolContents immediate\n    \n    \n    Using Jython:\n    AdminControl.invoke(ds, \"purgePoolContents\", \"immediate\")\n    \n    \n\nIf the purge operation is successful, no response will be observed. If the purge operation is not successful, the response will indicate a possible reason for failure. One common reason for failure is attempting to purge the contents of a connection pool which is not yet available (the connection pool is not created until a naming look-up of the associated datasource or connection factory occurs), resulting in an illegal state exception.  \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers Runtimes for Java Technology Java SDK Application Servers WebSphere Application Server for z/OS Java SDK z/OS 8.0, 7.0, 6.1", "content_type": "text", "id": "swg21220832"}, "is_correct_answer": true, "is_correct_document": true, "origin": "gold-label", "answer": {"answer": "WebSphere Application Server has an operation on the data source MBean that can be used to purge the connection pool.

Also, the queries that define the attribute view have\nbeen modified to remove the 'Period Start' and 'Period End'\nattributes. \n\nAPAR: IV59319\nAbstract: SAP AGENT NOT PICKING UP ALERTS FROM SOLUTION MANAGER \nAdditional Information: This is DOC APAR and the third Party OS \ncommand adapter should be configured and mail notification \nshould be enabled using appropriate steps. \n\nDefect: 53372\nAbstract: Unable to start SAP Agent when candlehome contains \u2018SAP\u2019\nword.\nAdditional Information: Post install script ignores variables\ncontaining 'SAP' keyword and they are not included in 'ksaenv'\nfile. When CANDLEHOME and JAVAHOME contained 'SAP' keyword,\nthey were ignored as well resulting in failure to start \nksaagent.\n\nDefect: 49745\nAbstract: Agent doesn't read syslog.idx file correctly\nAdditional Information: SAP agent read '<SID>_syslog.idx' incorrectly\nleading to corrupt '.idx' file. This resulted in system log not\ngetting detected sometimes.\nNote: This issue is reproducible only with multi instance SAP\nsystem. \n\nDefect: 47233\nAbstract: Test connection utility is not working on windows as\ndesigned for application server mode.\nAdditional Information: With the new NWRFC library, 'Gateway Host' \nand 'Gateway service' are not required while creating a RFC\nconnection with the SAP server. So, these fields have been \nremoved from the agent configuration panel. \n\nDefect: 45898\nAbstract: R/3 action link of \u2018Close Alert\u2019 and \u2018Close Alerts of the\nsame type\u2019 are missing in \u2018Alert Information\u2019 view of CCMS\nmonitoring workspaces.\nAdditional Information: The workspace has been modified to create the\ntwo missing links. Also, the code on the SAP side has been \nfixed to correct the close alert mechanism. \n\nEnhancement: 44620\nAbstract: Netweaver RFC support added for SAP Agent common\nlayers.\nAdditional Information: Netweaver RFC v7.20 support has been added.\nCommunication with SAP system will now happen using the NWRFC\nlibrary instead of the Classic RFC library. \n\nEnhancement: 44663\nAbstract: Logging of SAP 'Component Version Id' and 'Interim Fix Id'\nin the agent log file.\nAdditional Information: SAP 'Component Version Id' and 'Interim Fix\nId' are returned as additional parameters by the \n'/IBMMON/ITM_FUNC_PARMS' function module and can be viewed in\nthe agent logs with minimum trace level enabled.\n\nEnhancement: 45911\nAbstract: Facilitate remote connection of type 'Internal Connection',\n'Connections via ABAP driver' and 'TCP/IP' Connections defined\nin SAP server.\nAdditional Information: This link has been provided from the 'Test\nConnection' link in the 'Connection Monitoring' workspace to \ncheck the status of a remote connection on demand.\n\nEnhancement: 45973\nAbstract: Facilitate single Unicode ITM file containing both BADI and\nnon-BADI objects. \nAdditional Information: Single ITM file has been provided to import\nthe SAP Agent transport on all supported SAP versions having \nBADI or non-BADi implementation.\n\n--------------------------------\n7.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\n--------------------------------\n\nAPAR: IV53685\nAbstract: TRANSPORT IMPORT FAILS FOR ITM_CONN_CHECK FUNCTION MODULE.\nAdditional Information: 711 GA transport fails with ABAP dump for the\n/IBMMON/ITM_CONN_CHECK function module. Because of this, the \ndata is not collected and displayed on the Tivoli Enterprise\nPortal for some attribute groups, and the dumps are generated \non SAP side.\n\nAPAR: IV52434\nAbstract: ATTRLIB MISSING SLASH IF INSTANCE IS CREATED USING \nADDSYSTEM. \nAdditional Information: Because of the missing slash in ATTRLIB \nfield name, the agent is configured incorrectly that hampers \nthe agent functionality and Historical Data Collection (HDC). \nThis problem occurs when the SAP agent instance is created by \nusing the tacmd Addsystem command, and the same instance is \nreconfigured.\n\nAPAR: IV51184\nAbstract: FUNCTION MODULE \"/IBMMON/ITM_SYS_LOG\" GENERATING ABAP \nDUMP.\nAdditional Information: The \"IBMMON/ITM_SYS_LOG\" function module is \ninvoked every 10 minutes and it generates ABAP dumps.\n\"/IBMMON/ITM_SYS_LOG\" function module was called with \n\"ITM_R3_LOG_RECORD\" parameter. This parameter is not defined. \nThe Syslog information is available from INS and GRP subnodes,\nhowever, problem occurs only while collecting the data for \n:GRP subnode.\n\nAPAR: IV47613\nAbstract: ABAP DUMPS DUE TO OVERFLOW IN /IBMMON/ITM_CCMS_ALERTS \n(ALERT UNIQUE ID). \nAdditional Information: Added a new attribute named \n'Extended Alert Unique Identifier' to hold bigger alert unique \nidentifier. The extended alert unique identifier attribute is \nused to close an alert in the SAP system.\n\nDefect: 43177 \nAbstract: Data is not coming for \u2018ITM_USER_INFORMATION\u2019 for ':Sys' \nnode.\nAdditional Information: The code considered only the 'INS' node.\nTherefore, the user information link in the 'SYS' node did not\nreceive any data. \n\nDefect: 43075 \nAbstract: 'No Applicable data' seen for CCMS Monitoring on ALL Grp \nnode along with 9911 alert in second call of agent in case of \nCEN configured SAP.\nAdditional Information: When retrieving alerts for the first call of\nthe new CCMS design for GRP node in case of Central (CEN) \nsystem, 'No Applicable Data' is displayed on the Tivoli \nEnterprise Portal. The second call of the agent was \ngenerating a 9911 alert.\n\nDefect: 42393 \nAbstract: Argument column in \"Lock Information\" is showing invalid \ndata.\nAdditional Information: Lock argument of locked object shows string \n'[][][][][][][]' on the Tivoli Enterprise Portal, when all \npossible fields are responsible for locking that object. \n\nDefect: 42317\nAbstract : Delete transport unable to delete reference of agent BADI\nclass from MAI configured SAP system. \nAdditional Information: BADI delete transport must be able to \ndelete all relevant BADI classes and implementations from the \nsystem where BADI is imported.\n\nDefect: 40637 \nAbstract: Exception condition \"ITM-NOT_FOUND\" raised in case syslog\nrecords are not found at SAP side. \nAdditional Information: If particular syslog details are not present \non the SAP system, then while accessing syslog details using \nsys_detail link on the Tivoli Enterprise Portal, a \"Exception \ncondition 'ITM-NOT FOUND' raised\" short dump is generated on \nthe SAP side and a blank screen is displayed on the Tivoli \nEnterprise Portal.\n\nDefect: 39686 \nAbstract: Syslog causing ABAP dump for Group Sub Node. \nAdditional Information: For the logs and traces attribute group of \nthe GRP node, exceptions are raised. \n\nDefect: 39681 \nAbstract: Data is missing for many columns of ITM_JOBS. \nAdditional Information: Data is not displayed for many columns of \nITM_Jobs.\n\nDefect: 39007 \nAbstract: \"No applicable Data\" row should be seen on TEP for system \nlog under system name. \nAdditional Information: If there is no data for the \"System Log\" \nworkspace, then, \"No applicable data\" must be displayed in the \nSystem Name column. \n\nDefect: 38998 \nAbstract: Unable to interpret X as a number in function module\n/IBMMON/ITM_HOSTS. \nAdditional Information: If the SAP system contains more than 9 \napplication servers (RFC servers), the \"Unable to interpret * \nas a number\" message is displayed in the /IBMMON/ITM_HOSTS \nfunction module.\n\nDefect: 38995 \nAbstract: Tivoli SAP agent causing dump in SAP on UNIX server. \nAdditional Information: If an exception occurred while reading job \nlog, the /IBMMON/ITM_JOB_LOG function module is terminated. \n\nDefect: 38903 \nAbstract: IDOC Number not included in the Display item. \nAdditional Information: The \"IDOC Number\" is not available to use \nas a display item in situations. \n\nDefect: 38251 \nAbstract : Data is getting fetched for invalid sub-nodes.\nAdditional Information: Data must be returned only for the sub node \nthat is called; data must not be returned for other irrelevant\nsub nodes. Call from the agent gives ITM_MGROUP or Origin node \nas input to most of the function modules that contain the node \ndetails.\n\nEnhancement: 38724\nAbstract: \"Client\" column is required for ITM_IDOC workspace to \ndifferentiate the respective client's data. \nAdditional Information: Added a \"Client\" column in the \n\"IDOC Information\" view of the \"Data Transfer Information\" \nworkspace.

Use the .tar\nfile if you are working in a UNIX environment; use the .zip file if\nyou are working in a Windows environment.\n\n\n5.0 Installation instructions \n=============================\n\nThis fix can only be installed over an existing installation of\n711 FP0001. Use the following steps to install this fix.\n\n5.1 Before installing the fix \n-----------------------------\n- The prerequisites listed under section 3.1 entitled 'Upgrade \nPrerequisites for this fix' must be installed when for upgrade.\n\n- For the purpose of this README, the <CANDLEHOME> symbol is the \nIBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory. The default value\nfor CANDLEHOME is '/opt/IBM/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'\non Windows systems.\n\n- Before installing this interim fix on UNIX systems, set the CANDLEHOME \nenvironment variable to the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation\ndirectory.\n\nFor example: \n> CANDLEHOME=/opt/IBM/ITM\n> export CANDLEHOME\n\n- Because there is no uninstall utility for this interim fix, be sure to\nperform a backup of your environment before installing this fix.\n\n5.2 Local agent update\n--------------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n(7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001.tar or .zip) to a temporary\ndirectory on the system that contains the agent to be updated.\nFor the purpose of this README, the <TEMP> symbol represents the\nfully qualified path to this directory. Note: On Windows systems,\nthis path includes the drive letter.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems\nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a\ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all supported\noperating systems.\n\n3. Use the \"itmpatch\" command to install the fix for the operating\nsystem for that agent. For more information on the \"itmpatch\" \ncommand, see section [6.2]. \n\nOn UNIX systems, if the fix was expanded to \n<TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001, the install command is:\n\n> <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> \n-i <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001/ksa_xxxxxx_tema_if0001.tar\n\nwhere:\n- xxxxxx corresponds to the value in the first column \nreturned by the ./cinfo -i command. \n\nIn the following example, the file is \n\"ksa_li6263_tema_if0001.tar\".\n> ./cinfo -i\n[Monitoring Agent for Your Product]\n[lx8266 Version: 07.11.01.01] \n\nOn Windows systems, if the fix was expanded to \n<TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001, the install command is:\n\nFor Windows 32-bit\n> <TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> \n-i <TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\\ksa_winnt_tema_if0001.cab\n\nFor Windows 64-bit \n> <TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> \n-i <TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\\ksa_wix64_tema_if0001.cab\n\nNote: if the itmpatch command gets this error:\n\"The application has failed to start because its side-by-side\nconfiguration is incorrect. Please see the application event\nlog for more detail.\" it's necessary install the \"visualstudio\nredistribution package\" before to run the itmpatch command.\n\nFor a 32bit architecture,\nthe name of this package is vcredist_x86.exe, available at\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5582 [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5582]\n\nFor a 64bit architecture,\nthe name of this package is vcredist_x64.exe,available at \nhttp://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=2092 [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=2092]\n\n\n5.3 Remote agent update\n----------------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file \n(7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001.tar or .zip) to a temporary\ndirectory on the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server system.\nFor the purpose of this README, the <TEMP> symbol represents the\nfully qualified path to this directory. Note: On Windows systems,\nthis path includes the drive letter.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems \nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a \ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported\noperating systems.\n\n3. To add the agent fix bundles into the remote deploy depot, use\nthe \"tacmd addBundles\" command found in $CANDLEHOME/bin on UNIX\nsystems or in %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin on Windows systems. For more \ninformation on the \"tacmd addBundles\" command, see the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring Command Reference.\n\nOn UNIX systems, \nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001:\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -n -i \n<TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 \n\nOn Windows systems, \nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -n -i \n<TEMP>\\7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 \n\nwhere:\n-n indicates that prerequisite bundles are not automatically\nadded. The -n parameter must be used because the fix \ndirectory does not contain any prerequisites that the fix\nmight require. See Section 3.1 for the prerequisites\nfor this fix.\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be\nadded to the depot. \n\n4. After \"tacmd addBundles..\" from step 3 above, control files\non the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server and the\nTivoli Enterprise Portal Server must be updated.\nThese updates must be done manually.\n\na. Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server update\nThe sa_dd_07110101.xml and sa_dd.properties files must be\ncopied from the <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001\ndirectory to the 071001000 version of the Tivoli Enterprise\nMonitoring Services depot.\n\nTwo scripts are provided to make these copies and are \nin the fix <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 directory\nafter the expansion of the tar or zip file:\n\nksa_patchdepot.bat - Windows\nksa_patchdepot.sh - UNIX\n\nFrom the <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 directory,\nrun the appropriate script based on the operating system. The\nscript output contains details about the copies being made.\n\nb. Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server update\nResource files must be copied from the\n<TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 directory to the\nTivoli Enterprise Monitoring Portal directory.\n\nTwo scripts are provided to make these copies and are \nin the fix <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 directory\nafter the expansion of the tar or zip file:\n\nksa_patch_resource_teps.bat - Windows\nksa_patch_resource_teps.sh - UNIX\n\nFrom the <TEMP>/7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001 directory,\nrun the appropriate script based on the operating system. The \nscript output contains details about the copies being made.\n\n5. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server, and deploy\nthe fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use\nthe following \"tacmd\" commands. For more information on the \n\"tacmd login\" and \"tacmd updateAgent\" commands, see the IBM \nTivoli Monitoring Command Reference.\n\nOn UNIX systems: \n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd updateAgent -t sa \n-n <Managed system name>\n-v 07110101\n\nOn Windows systems:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd updateAgent -t sa \n-n <Managed system name> \n-v 07110101\n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is \nspecified as two characters (sa), not three characters (ksa).\n- The node (-n) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is the \nmanaged system name of the operating system (OS) agent to be \nupdated. The target node for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command \nis always an OS agent.\n\n5.4 Agent support update\n------------------------------\nUse the following steps to update the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nDesktop. \nNote: If SDA feature is enable at the HUB TEMS, then below steps are\nare not required. SDA will install only browser support and if\ncustomer is using TEP Desktop then install the support manfully\nas shown below.\n\nThis fix (7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001) includes changes to the\nagent support files that must be installed. If you installed these\nupdates, there are no additional installation steps. If you did not\ninstall these updates, use the following steps to update the Tivoli\nEnterprise Monitoring Server, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or\nTivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop.\n\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001.tar or .zip) to the Tivoli\nEnterprise Monitoring Servers, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Servers,\nor Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktops. \n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems\nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a \ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported\nplatforms.\n\n3. Expand the archive file (ksa_tems_teps_tepd_if0001.tar or .zip)\nthat contains the updates for the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring \nServer, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, and Tivoli Enterprise \nPortal Desktop using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems or an \nextract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a directory\nstructure that includes a subdirectory called CD-ROM, with the\nnecessary updates.\n\n4. Use the Application Support Installer(ASI) GUI or the silent\ninstallation method to install the application support files. \n\nGUI installation option\n------------------------\nThe GUI can be started by using one of the following commands\nfrom within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is located. \n\nOn UNIX systems:\n> ./itmasi.sh [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nOn Windows systems:\n> itmasi [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nWhen prompted by the Application Support Installer for the \ninstallable media directory, select the CD-ROM directory, not the\ncomponent directory. The installer can install updates for \nmultiple components at the same time.\n\nNote: For IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3 or above, one \nof the following additional steps must be performed.\n\n1. Aquire a platform-specific pre-packaged JRE version \nof the Application Support Installer (ASI). See IBM \nTivoli Monitoring Application Support Installer, \n6.2-tiv-itm_asi-if0002 at \nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924]\nfor download and installation instructions.\n\n2. Specify the '-j javahome' parameter with the path to \na 32-bit java(r) 1.5 or java 1.6 installation when running \nthe itmasi.sh or itmasi.bat script described below. \n\n5. The next panel presented by the Application Support Installer \nasks for the selection of Tivoli Monitoring components to which \nyou want to add application support. For this fix, check or \nclear the check boxes as follows:\n\n[checked | unchecked] - Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server (TEMS)\n[checked | unchecked] - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server (TEPS)\n[checked | unchecked] - Tivoli Enterprise Desktop Client (TEPD)\n\nContinue through the remaining GUI panels selecting SAP Agent\n07.11.01.01 support to complete the installation.\n\n6. If the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop or Tivoli Enterprise \nPortal Browser was running when the update was installed, it must\nbe restarted.\n\n7. If the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server being updated is remote\n(not a Hub Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server) then restart the \nTivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server.\n\n5.5 Installing SAP agent transport\n------------------------------------\nNote: From this fix onwards,a single ITM file has been provided for\nimporting SAP transport on all supported SAP versions having BADI or\nnon-BADI implementation.\n\nThis procedure installs the SAP transport into the SAP system. You\nare not required to uninstall the previous transport before\ninstalling this transport.\n\n1. Go to the ABAP directory in the location where you expanded the\nfix archive file.\n\n2. Copy the transport files into the SAP environment as follows: \n\na. The following two sets of transport files are in the \nABAP directory of the SAP agent fix archive:\n\n1) K711_00103U.ITM and R711_00103U.ITM in /ABAP directory.\nThese files are Unicode versions of the transport. \n\n2) K711_00103_DELETE.ITM and R711_00103_DELETE.ITM\nThese transport files remove the ABAP code. Do not import\nthe DELETE transport unless you stop using the product \nentirely and want to remove the transports from your SAP\nsystems.\n\nb. Copy your transport files to the SAP Transport System data\ndirectory as follows:\n\n1) Copy the K711_00103U.ITM file to the cofiles directory.\n2) Copy the R711_00103U.ITM file to the data directory.\n\n3. Run the following command for non-BADI and BADI where:\nSID Target SAP : system ID\nPROFILE_NAME : Name of the tp profile file\nnnn : Number for the target client where the agent is to run\n\ntp addtobuffer ITMK711_00103U SID\npf=\\usr\\sap\\trans\\bin\\PROFILE_NAME\ntp import ITMK711_00103U SID client=nnn U16\npf=\\usr\\sap\\trans\\bin\\PROFILE_NAME\n\n\nAlternately, you can use the SAP STMS transaction to import the\ntransport requests. Ensure that the Import Transport Request Again \nand the Overwrite Objects in Unconfirmed Repairs options are \nchecked on the Import Options tab of the Import Transport Request\nwindow.\n\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n========================================\n\n6.1 Installation instructions for agent baroc file\n------------------------------------------------------\nThis fix (7.1.1.1-TIV-ITM_SAP-IF0001) includes changes to the\nagent baroc files that must be reinstalled. If you have already\ninstalled these baroc files, there are no additional installation\nsteps. If you have not installed the files, see the \"IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring, Version 6.2.2FP2: Installation and Setup Guide\" \n(ITM6.2.2FP2 Installation and Setup Guide.pdf) under \n\"Installing monitoring agent baroc files on the event server\" in the\n\"Installing the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Console Event Synchronization\" \nsection for more information.\n\n6.2 Additional information on using the itmpatch command\n---------------------------------------------------------\nThe itmpatch command has the following syntax.\n\nUsage: itmpatch -h <installation home> [OPTIONS]\n\nitmpatch -h <installation home>\n-t { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }\n\nitmpatch -h <installation home>\n-i { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }\n\nwhere:\n\n-h Specifies the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory\n-i Specifies the path to the directory or patch file to be installed\n-t Generates a report of the actions to be taken by the patch\n\nFor example, on UNIX systems:\n- To preview the fix installation, use the \"-t\" option:\n> <CANDLEHOME>/bin/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -t <TEMP>\n\n- To install the fix, use the \"-i\" option:\n> <CANDLEHOME>/bin/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -i <TEMP>\n\nwhere: \n<CANDLEHOME> is the fully qualified IBM Tivoli Monitoring \ninstallation directory. On Windows systems, this path must include\nthe drive letter.\n<TEMP> represents the fully qualified directory specification, \nwhere the fix is located. On Windows systems, this path must \ninclude the drive letter.\n\n6.3 Verifying the update\n------------------------\n1. To verify that the agent was updated correctly, use the tacmd\ncommand to view the current version of the agent after the agent\nis restarted. You are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise\nMonitoring Server before viewing the agent version.\n\nFor example:\nOn UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring\ninstallation directory. The default location is '/opt/IBM/ITM'.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t sa\n\nOn Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory. The default location\nis 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t sa\n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is\nspecified as two characters (sa), not three characters (ksa).\n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is \n07.11.01.01\n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is\nspecified as two characters (sa), not three characters (ksa).\n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is \n07.11.01.01\n\nAfter the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify\nthat the agent was successfully updated.\n\nFor the agent on Windows systems, the version number is\n07.11.01.01\nFor the agent on UNIX systems, the version number is\n07.11.01.01\n\n2. To verify that the agent support files were updated correctly,\nuse the kincinfo command on Windows systems or the cinfo command\non Linux(R) or UNIX systems. The sample output below shows the\nversions of the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli Enterprise\nMonitoring Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop systems \nafter this fix has been successfully applied.\n\nNote:\n- The date of the build displayed might not be accurate. This is\na known problem.\n\nOn Linux systems:\n--------------------\nTo validate that all components have been installed, run the\nfollowing command:\n\nFor example: \n> %CANDLE_HOME%/bin/cinfo -i\n\nNote: cinfo output may differ depending on ITM version.\n\n*********** Fri Dec 5 10:14:10 IST 2014 ******************\nUser: root Groups: root bin daemon sys adm disk wheel pkcs11\nHost name : IBMSAP1V9 Installer Lvl:06.23.03.00\nCandleHome: /opt/ibm\n***********************************************************\n...Product inventory\n\nax IBM Tivoli Monitoring Shared Libraries\nli6263 Version: 06.23.03.00\n\ngs IBM GSKit Security Interface\nli6243 Version: 07.40.43.00\n\njr Tivoli Enterprise-supplied JRE\nli6263 Version: 06.12.00.00\n\nsa IBM Tivoli Composite Application Manager Agent for SAP \nApplications\nli6263 Version: 07.11.01.01\n\nue Tivoli Enterprise Services User Interface Extensions\nli6263 Version: 06.23.03.00\n\nui Tivoli Enterprise Services User Interface\nli6263 Version: 06.23.03.00\n\n\n7.0 Known problems and workarounds\n===================================\n\nAbstract: While configuring the agent instance on UNIX, more than 3 \nletters are accepted as instance ID. \nProblem: Three letters are accepted as Instance ID while configuring \nagent instance on UNIX. This can result in failure to connect\nto the SAP system as the \".cfg\" file for that instance will\nbe generated with a wrong name.\nWorkaround:\nThe user should make sure that only three lettered name is \nentered as the instance ID while configuring an agent instance. \n\n\n8.0 Additional product information\n==================================\n\nABAP Transport Compatibility:\n------------------------------\nEach fix includes an updated agent executable\nprogram (ksaagent or ksaagent.exe) and an updated ABAP transport.\nInstall both programs to obtain the highest level of support.\n\nIn some situations, you cannot install\na new transport immediately because of change control processes on the\nmySAP systems. In these situations, sometimes you can run a new agent\nexecutable with a prior version of the ABAP transport. This section \nexplains when it is possible to run a newer agent executable program\nwith an older version of an ABAP transport.\n\nNote: The mySAP agent does not run correctly if not installed with\na compatible level of the transport.\n\nFix Level Delivered Transport Minimum Transport Level\n----------- ------------------- -----------------------\nFP0001-IF0001 ITMK711_00103U ITMK710_00103U\nFP0001 ITMK711_00100U ITMK711_00100U\nIF0001 ITMK711_00099U ITMK711_00098U\n711 GA ITMK711_00098U ITMK711_00098U\n\n\n9.0 Copyright and trademark information:\n================================== \nA current list of IBM trademarks is available on the Web at \"Copyright\nand trademark information\" at www.ibm.com/legal/copytrade.shtml.\n\n\n10.0 Notices\n=======\nINTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION PROVIDES THIS PUBLICATION\n\"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,\nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nNON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\nSome jurisdictions do not allow disclaimer of express or implied\nwarranties in certain transactions, therefore, this statement may not\napply to you.\n\nThis information could include technical inaccuracies or typographical\nerrors.

You notice a change in the default behaviour between WebSphere Application Server versions regarding the user identifier flowed on the MQCONN to the target WebSphere MQ Queue Manager:\n\n- When using WebSphere Application Server v7.0 and v8.0, no user identifier value (blank) is passed to the queue manager. \n\n- When using WebSphere Application Server V8.5, a non-blank user identifier value is passed to the queue manager. \n\nIn the latter case, you receive the following exception when creating a connection to a queue manager:\n\nJMSCMQ0001: WebSphere MQ call failed with compcode '2' ('MQCC_FAILED') reason '2035' ('MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED') \n\nIs this change in behaviour expected? \n\nANSWER\nWebSphere MQ access control is based on user identifiers. There is a deliberate change in the default behaviour between the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS and the WebSphere MQ V7.1 (and later) classes for JMS regarding the default user identifier flowed to the queue manager.\nFrom the WebSphere MQ V7.1 classes for JMS onwards, a non-blank user identifier is always flowed to the queue manager when creating a connection to WebSphere MQ. This is true even if no user identifier has been specified, or a blank or null user identifier has been specified; for example by calling:\n\nMQConnectionFactory.createConnection();\n\nor:\n\nMQConnectionFactory.createConnection(\u201c\u201d, \u201c\u201d);\n\nor:\n\nMQConnectionFactory.createConnection(null, null);\n\nIn the case where a null or blank user identifier has been specified, the WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later classes for JMS will query the value of the Java System Property user.name. The value of this property is flowed to the queue manager for authorization.\n\nAs a result, if the user identifier specified by the Java System Property user.name is not authorized to access the queue manager, the queue manager will return an exception to the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS with Reason Code MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED and the connection to the queue manager will not be established.\n\nThis change in behaviour could affect topologies that previously relied on the default behaviour in the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS that flowed a blank user identifier when establishing a CLIENT mode transport connection. The expectation that a blank or null user identifier will be flowed by default, and that the user identifier that started the WebSphere MQ server-connection channel would be used by the queue manager when performing the authorization checks, is no longer valid from the WebSphere MQ V7.1 classes for JMS.\n\nIn the case outlined above, system administrators that are currently relying on the default behaviour of the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS should review their configurations regarding the use of user identifiers and authorization. This might also help to improve security within their WebSphere MQ topology.\n\n\nIn summary, the change in behaviour will affect users of:\n\n- The WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later classes for JMS.\n\n- The WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later JCA Resource Adapter that includes the classes for JMS.\n\n- Versions of WebSphere Application Server that include the WebSphere MQ V7.1 and later JCA Resource Adapter. Currently this is WebSphere Application Server V8.5.0.0 and later.\n\n\nThe com.ibm.mq.jms.ForceUserID Java System Property\n\nA Java System Property called \u201ccom.ibm.mq.jms.ForceUserID\u201d was introduced as part of APAR IZ49302 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ49302] and included from WebSphere MQ V6.0.2.8 and WebSphere MQ V7.0.1.\n\nThe changes made as part of this APAR could be used to change the default behaviour in the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 classes for JMS regarding the user identifier value flowed to the queue manager when creating a connection.\n\nThis property is no longer valid from WebSphere MQ V7.1. Setting this property will have no affect on the WebSphere MQ V7.1 classes for JMS and later.\n\nOther Useful Resources\n\nWebSphere MQ Documentation\n\nThe WebSphere MQ Documentation contains a section on planning user authorization which also includes a description on access control for clients. A link to this section in the WebSphere MQ V7.1 Documentation is as follows:\n\nWebSphere MQ > Security > Planning for your security requirements >> Planning authorization [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.mq.doc/zs14070_.htm]\n\nTechnotes\n\nA Technote is available that explains J2C Authentication Aliases and how they can be used to configure the user identifier flowed to a queue manager when creating a connection: \n\nEnterprise applications, the WebSphere Application Server WebSphere MQ messaging provider connection factories and Authentication Aliases explained [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21580097]\n\n\n \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers WebSphere Application Server", "content_type": "text", "id": "swg21662193"}, "is_correct_answer": true, "is_correct_document": true, "origin": "gold-label", "answer": {"answer": "WebSphere MQ access control is based on user identifiers.

The discussion in this case refers to Rational Application Developer v7 and WebSphere Application Server v6.0 as per the originally reported user scenario.\n\n\n Background on Server Publish Settings:\n\nThe WebSphere Application Server v6.1 server settings in the Rational Application Developer v7 in the server overview editor (such as double click or right-click > open on the server in the Servers view) defaults to the setting: \n\n> Publishing\n* Run server with resources within the workspace\n, and its associated\n[x] Minimize application files copied to the server\n\nwhile the WebSphere Application Server v6.0 setting has the option 'Minimize application files copied to the server' disabled.\n\nThis is the default setting which uses the Rational Application Developer WebSphere Application Server server tooling loose configuration capability combined with WebSphere Application Server v6.x server WebSphere Rapid Deploy capability. This will be referred to as the loose configuration scenario.\n\nIn the loose configuration scenario, the server runs the EAR application located directly from the various output folders from the projects in the workspace. Think of the server as keeping handles/pointers for your EAR (and its modules) to their location in the workspace. It also uses a combination of Eclipse/WTP and WebSphere Application Server related metadata information. It does not actually install the EAR and its modules physically to the server as for a stand-alone WebSphere Application Server V6.x server as would be done with the option:\n* Run server with resources on Server\n\nNotes:\n1. The WebSphere Application Serve v7+ admin console will not even show an [OK] button when attempting to associate an Shared Library to an EAR if proper settings are not used in Server Tools\nWhenever an EAR is in the workspace ,as in when using publishing option in RAD: \n\"Run Server with resources from the workspace\"\n, there will always be some settings in the WAS admin console related to the EARs that will be greyed/grayed out and you cannot configure. This occurs because the EAR in not physically installed on the server profile, and results in certain limitation when using the admin console. It is necessary to use the option \n\"Run server with resources on the server\" \nto enable these classloading options. Otherwise using \"Run Server with resources from the workspace\" is recommended for optimal publishing of EAR(s) and making code changes.\n\n2. To better understand loose configuration/loose-config/looseconfig.xmi:\nHow to compare a single-root module to a non single-root module [www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21302931]\n\n\nShared Library Solution:\n\nShared Libraries configured on an EAR in the WebSphere Application Server v6.x admin console are not completely supported unless you use: \"Run server with resources on Server\".\n\nThe WebSphere Application Server V6.x Administrative Console does not handle loosely-installed applications well. However, it usually will work with Shared Libraries when:\n\n* Run server with resources within the workspace\n\nif its associated option\n\n[ ] Minimize application files copied to the server\n\nis unchecked.\nIt is worth while attempting to clear this option, as it often works and allows you to continue to work with the rapid deployment advantages of working with the application as it in the workspace and having those changes picked up with the default auto-publish.\n\nAfter making any of the above changes in the Server Overview editor, make sure to Remove your project/EAR from the server and then Add your project/EAR to the server for the new changes to take effect. It may also be necessary to restart the server.\n\nNote: Any shared library jars need to be added to the Java Build Path of any project in a RAD workspace, that has a build/compile time dependency on those jars. RAD would not be aware of any jars configured as a shared library in the WAS admin console for an EAR/WAR.\n\n\nShared Library Recommended Practice: \n\nDisabling/unchecking Minimize application files copied to the server with Run server with resources within the workspace is not a proper work-around. The server tools cannot guarantee what the WebSphere Application Server run time will do in these cases when they are constantly updating the EAR (that is, the relationship between the EAR and the shared library could potentially be destroyed). Once the application code/configuration is not going through many changes, it will usually work\n\nWhen developing, if you really want to have a shared library in a loose-config scenario then you should use the Enhanced EAR editor to define the shared libraries. This would be done in the EAR Deployment Descriptor editor under: Deployment Tab : Shared Libraries .\nWhen using the Enhanced EAR there is a limitation. Application-scoped shared libraries cannot depend on application-scoped variables (==substitution variables) to specify their location. If application-scoped variables are needed to specify a shared library, select them in the admin console at the cell, node or server scope instead. If needed, consult WebSphere Application Server server support on this limitation.\n\nWhen you are ready to export the EAR to an actual test/production server, you can In Rational Application Developer v6/v7 delete the {workspace}\\MyEAR\\META-INF\\ibmconfig folder containing the Deployment Tab information for the Enhanced EAR, before exporting the EAR (or in the EAR itself using whatever compressed file utility you may have).\nThen, in the actual production server set the Shared Libraries in the admin console on the installed EAR\nand define whatever other resources may have been configured in the Enhanced EAR.\n\nNote - Rational Application Developer v7.0 WebSphere Application Server v6.1 Shared Library \"admin console\" - Error ADMA017EE and WSVR0501E:\n\nIf using WebSphere Application Server v6.1, upgrading to WebSphere Application Server v6.1.0.13 or later is recommended, because of known APAR/defect:\nPK49029: IN WSAS RUNTIME SERVER FAILS TO START AFTER ASSOCIATING SHARED LIBRARY WITH AN ENTERPRISE APPLICATION\nThis involved the use of \"Run server with resources in the workspace\" as well as\n\"Minimize application files copied to the server\", and the error:\nWSVR0501E: Error creating component com.ibm.ws.runtime.component.ApplicationMgrImpl@5d125d12 .\n\nThe above is an example of why it is useful to try testing with the WAS server version having the latest fixpack applied when working with with RAD server tools. Similarly apply the latest fixpack to your RAD version. There have been ongoing improvements and fix(s) involving loose-config in both RAD and WAS. \n\nContact IBM Support for RAD if the above information did not help.\n\n\nUseful WebSphere Application Server ClassLoader information:\n\nFrom a WebSphere\u00ae Application Server (WAS) classloading/class loader perspective, in this case WebSphere Application Server v6.1, it is useful to consult the RedPaper: WebSphere Application Server V6.1: Classloader Problem Determination, [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpapers/pdfs/redp4307.pdf] which addresses use of Shared Libraries, or the general url under Related information. Also, the class loader/loading chapters in the System Management & Configuration Handbooks for the various WebSphere Application Server server versions under Related information, provide similar background information. Specific to WebSphere Application Server v5.1 there is the red piece: WebSphere Application Server V5: Using Shared Library Support.\n\nUnder Related information, the Rational Application Developer v7.0 technote: J2EE classpath Container Preferences with Java Build Path and J2EE Module Dependencies Properties, is useful from the perspective of the use of Java utility projects/jars by J2EE Projects.\n\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Education For RAD v6/WASv6 Server tooling [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21199368]\nWAS V6.1 Classloader Problem Problem Determination [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/redp4307.html?Open]\nWAS V6.1 System Management and Configuration [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg247304.html?Open]\nWAS V6.0 System Management and Configuration [http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg246451.html?Open]\nRADv7.0 - J2EE classpath Container Preferences with..

For MySQL versions prior to 5.7.9, selecting from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables produces an empty result set with a deprecation warning. \n\n \n\nNote: MySQL agent is packaged with ITCAM for Applications (IBM Tivoli Monitoring) and Application Performance Monitoring 8.1.x solutions.\n\n\nCAUSE\nFew tables in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA that are used by the agent to collect monitoring data are deprecated in the MySQL server versions 5.7.6 and above. Due to this deprecation these tables cannot be queried normally and cause an error when the agent tries to query these tables to get data.\n\n\nMore details about the MySQL INFORMATION_SCHEMA migration to performance_schema here: \n\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/performance-schema-variable-table-migration.html [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/performance-schema-variable-table-migration.html]\n\n\n\nENVIRONMENT\nMySQL agent installed on MySQL Server versions 5.7.6 and above.\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nUsers wanting to run the agent on MySQL server versions 5.7.6 and above should use the 'show_compatibility_56' [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html] system variable which affects whether MySQL 5.6 compatibility is enabled with respect to how system and status variable information is provided by the INFORMATION_SCHEMA. \n\nThis variable can be set from the MySQL command prompt as: \n\nset global show_compatibility_56=ON; \n\n \n\nThe default value of the variable 'show_compatibility_56' for MySQL server versions <=5.7.7 is \u2018ON\u2019 and for versions >=5.7.8 is \u2018OFF\u2019. \n\n \n\nUser can check the value of this variable by running the following command from the MySQL command prompt: \n\nshow global variables like \"show_compatibility_56\"; \n\n \n\nThis variable can also be set in the MySQL server configuration file also called as Option file. \n\nUser needs to add the following line to the \u2018my.cnf\u2019 file (located at \u2018<MySQL_Installation_Dir>/my.cnf\u2019 for Windows and \u2018/etc/my.cnf\u2019 for UNIX/Linux): \n\nshow_compatibility_56=ON \n\n \n\nThe paths mentioned above are the default paths for the Option file.

The same goes for the product libraries used by your client applications.\n\n\nVersions of modules are given in the standard IBM format V.R.M.F which stands for Version.Release.Modification.Fixpack. See the V.R.M.F Maintenance Stream Delivery Vehicle terminology explanation [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27008656] for more details.\n\n\n\nNot using the exact same version is not supported as it can cause unexpected behaviors.\n\nThis means that support will assist with problems on such non-supported configurations by testing with all modules at the same version/fix pack:\n\n\n * If the issue happens to be caused by the mix of versions/fix packs, the solution will be to put all modules at the same version/fix pack. \n * If the issue is fixed in a latest fix pack, the solution will be to apply it on all your modules.\n\nANSWER\nJRules or ODM are made of several modules which components versions can be obtained in different ways. The below tables explain how to get the version information of each deployed product components, depending on whether you are using JRules or ODM. \n\n \n\n \n\nYou will also need to consider any of your applications using the JRules/ODM libraries, including any Monitored Transparent Decision Service (MTDS) or web service generated through the Rule Studio or Rule Designer \"Client for RuleApp\" wizards. \n\nFor those, you will need to find the product JARs you packaged in your WARs and/or EARs deployed to the server, or present in the classpath of your stand-alone Java applications. Those JARs are typically named jrules-xyz.jar. \n\nThe product version information of those libraries is specified at the \"Implementation-Version: ...\" line of the MANIFEST.MFfile found under theMETA-INF folder of each JARs. \n\n \n\n * For WODM/ODM modules:\n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21400738&amp;aid=1]\nComponent [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21400738&amp;aid=1]\nWhere to find the version [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21400738&amp;aid=1]\nRule & Event Designer [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21400738&amp;aid=1]\nIn \"Help > About Eclipse SDK \", click the \"IBM\" button.

No update is required for \"thin client\" computers. You must upgrade all thick clients and servers to the same IBM Datacap version and feature pack. Different versions of IBM Datacap are not compatible; therefore, you cannot connect an IBM Datacap client with a server that has a different IBM Datacap server version or feature pack installed. Operating Datacap Client or Datacap Web with an incompatible version of Datacap Server, or allowing different versions to access one database, can result in loss of data. \n\nOnce installed, this feature pack cannot be uninstalled. However, you can use \"Uninstall or change a program\" in Control Panel to uninstall the entire Datacap product. \n\nThe language you selected when installing Datacap 9.0.1 determined the language displayed in the InstallShield panels at that time, and also controls the language in which the InstallShield panels for this feature pack are displayed. \n\n \n\nAlerts! \n\n1) When running an update, the global ruleset DLLs are updated but the copies in each application are not updated. \n\nAs a result, new features and fixes are not applied to applications and customers might experience defects that have been fixed. \n\nThe global ruleset DLLs are in the Datacap\\RRS folder. The application copies are in the application DCO rules folder. \n\nCustomers must manually update the ruleset DLLs in each application where they are installed. \n\n2) When running an update, the master task configuration files are updated (Datacap\\ProgramSet) but the setting in applications are not updated (in application DCO folder). \n\nAs a result, new features and fixes are not applied to applications and customers might experience problems that have been fixed. \n\nThe master task configuration is located in Datacap\\ProgramSet.

To run the exporter executable on the command line, execute the following as the user that the Search WebSphere Application Server is running under: \n\n1. Change directory to the Stellent binary location. For example: \n\n $ cd /opt/IBM/Connections/data/local/search/stellent/dcs/oiexport\n\n2. Run the exporter command.\nThe exporter command has the following syntax: \n\n exporter inputpath=<path_to_input_file>\noutputpath=<path_to_extracted_text_output>\noutputid=FI_SEARCHTEXT\n\nFor example,\n$ ./exporter inputpath=/root/translation.pdf \\ outputpath=/root/testStellent.txt outputid=FI_SEARCHTEXT\n\nIf the text extraction worked successfully, you will see the following output: \n\nExport complete\n\nHowever, if you see a message like the one below, continue to step 3:\n\n./exporter: error while loading shared libraries: libsc_ex.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory \n\n\n 3 Operating System Environment Variables \n\nEnsure that the operating system environment variables LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH are set correctly in Section 1. Both variables should contain the Stellent installation directory. To get the current values of the environment variables, run the following commands as the user that the Search WebSphere Application Server is running under:\n\n$ echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n$ echo $PATH\n\nTo verify that the Stellent exporter executable can be found through the PATH environment variable, run the following command:\n\n$ which exporter\n\nThe output of this command should contain the full path to the exporter executable. For example:\n\n/opt/IBM/Connections/data/local/search/stellent/dcs/oiexport/exporter\n\n\n 4 WebSphere Environment \n\nUsing the WebSphere Application Server administration console, ensure that the WebSphere environment variable FILE_CONTENT_CONVERSION points to the exporter executable. \n\nFor example: /opt/IBM/Connections/data/local/search/stellent/dcs/oiexport/exporter\n\n\n 5 File Permissions \n\nEnsure that the user that the Search WebSphere Application Server is running under has sufficient privileges. They should have read/write/execute permissions on the exporter executable and read/write permissions on the other files in the Stellent installation directory.\n\n\n 6 Library compatibility \n\nVerify that the libraries deployed with Stellent are compatible with your platform.\n\nFor example, on a 64 bit Linux system:\n$ uname -a\nLinux host1 2.6.18-308.11.1.el5 #1 SMP Fri Jun 15 15:41:53 EDT 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n$ cd /opt/IBM/Connections/data/local/search/stellent/dcs/oiexport\n$ file libsc_ex.so\nlibsc_ex.so: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, AMD x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), not stripped\n\n(Note that your Stellent installation may contain 32 bit libraries though you are running on 64 bit platform. This is not an issue, provided that the 32 bit compatible libraries are on the LD_LIBRARY_PATH or can be found on the shared library search path).\n\n\n 7 Shared library dependencies \n\nThe Stellent exporter executable has a number of dependencies on both the shared libraries packaged with Stellent and on shared libraries installed on your system. To verify that all the required shared libraries can be found, use the 'ldd' command on the exporter executable as follows:\n\n$ ldd -v exporter\n\nCheck the output of this command for any shared libraries marked as '=> not found'. \n\n Stellent shared library not found \n\nIf a Stellent shared library can't be found, then check that the setting of your LD_LIBRARY_PATH operating system environment variable contains the Stellent installation directory. \n\n System shared library not found \n\nIf a system shared library can't be found, then you are missing a prerequisite library.\nNOTE: It is still possible to pick up libraries from locations other than those included in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH operating system environment variable, as long as they can be found elsewhere on the system's default search path. \n\nIn addition to libc.so.6, Stellent is dependent upon the following libraries: \nlibstdc++.so.5\nlibgcc_s.so.1 \n\nFor Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.0 and later, it is possible that you are missing the package compat-libstdc++-33 . This package contains libstdc++.so.5.\n\n\n\n\n * \n *", "content_type": "text", "id": "swg21613001"}, "is_correct_answer": true, "is_correct_document": true, "origin": "gold-label", "answer": {"answer": "In addition to libc.so.6, Stellent is dependent upon the following libraries: \nlibstdc++.so.5\nlibgcc_s.so.1 \n\nFor Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.0 and later, it is possible that you are missing the package compat-libstdc++-33 .

Service for these components is provided when and if required.\n   \n   \n * Apache Axis2\u2122 \n   Axis2 is an open source web services engine from the Apache Software Foundation and is used within CICS to provide the web service Java\u2122 engine for the Axis2 JVM server environment. Service for this component is provided when and if required.\n   \n   \n * WebSphere Application Server Liberty Profile\n   Liberty fix packs are provided on a regular basis through the CICS TS APAR delivery process and provide an update mechanism to keep the embedded CICS Liberty runtime synchronized with the fix packs provided by WebSphere Application Server. Keeping current helps you resolve problems faster for 2 reasons:  * Liberty APAR fixes (known as ifixes) can only be delivered on the latest Liberty fix pack that has been supplied by the CICS APAR process. \n    * CICS APAR fixes can require other fixes such as WebSphere Liberty fix packs.\n   \n   \n   \n\nCICS Explorer and z/OS Explorer\nThe CICS Software Development Kit (SDK) for Java includes components from CICS for developing CICS Java applications. The CICS SDK for Servlet and JSP support includes Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) and Liberty API libraries, and automatically installs required components such as WebSphere Developer Toolkit (WDT).\" Service for these components is provided through the CICS Explorer fix pack process when and if required. \n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27048530&amp;aid=4] Back to Top \n\n\nUpdate recommendations\n\nRecommended Service Upgrade (RSU) \nIBM recommends that you install all RSU [http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/support/servicetest/] PTFs as preventive software maintenance for CICS TS. An RSU is a predefined collection of PTFs identified with a SOURCEID of RSUyymm, where yy indicates the last 2 digits of the year and mm indicates the month. [http://www-03.ibm.com/servers/eserver/zseries/zos/servicetst/]You can order an RSU [http://www-1.ibm.com/servers/eserver/zseries/zos/servicetst/]from ShopzSeries [https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/ShopzSeries/ShopzSeries.jsp].\n\n\nEquinox and Apache Axis2\nThere is unlikely to be much maintenance for Equinox and Axis2.

It contains the following files: \n\n * audit_trail.csv \u2013 all user actions that influence the final results of the licensing reports, for example, software classification actions, uploads and imports of the PVU table, software catalog, and charge units as well as changes to the VM managers. \n * data_conditions.txt \u2013 conditions that were used during the generation of the audit snapshot, including the reporting period and filters applied on the reports as well as general information about the time when the snapshot was generated, version of the PVU table and software catalog, status of the import, aggregation, and recalculation. \n * part_numbers.csv - part numbers that are listed in the software catalog for all software products that are included in any of the CSV report files. \n * pvu_full_capacity.csv - PVU full capacity license metric results \n * pvu_sub_capacity.csv - PVU subcapacity license metric results \n * rvu_full_capacity.csv - RVU full capacity license metric results \n * rvu_sub_capacity.csv - RVU subcapacity license metric results \n * bundling_definitions.csv - list of IBM software regardless of its license type and utilization together with details of the computers on which the software is installed \n * readme.txt - a link to this document (technote) \n * checksums.txt, signature.rsa, and pub_key.pem - files used by IBM auditors to verify the authenticity and correctness of the audit snapshot.\n\n\n\nWhy some product instances are not listed in the CSV reports? \n\nCSV reports with information about PVU and RVU MAPC utilization (pvu_full_capacity.csv, pvu_sub_capacity.csv, rvu_full_capacity.csv, and rvu_sub_capacity.csv) list only software instances that were discovered during the license peak value time. If an instance was installed in your environment during the reporting period of the current audit snapshot but was not discovered during the license peak value time, the instance is not listed in the CSV reports. \n\nExample: \nThree instances of DB2 are installed. The reporting period is set to one month and DB2 license utilization is as follows: \n\u00b7 Instance 1 uses the maximum of 100 PVUs, \n\u00b7 Instance 2 uses the maximum of 300 PVUs, \n\u00b7 Instance 3 uses the maximum of 500 PVUs. \n\nThe license peak value occurs when the sum of PVU values for all instances is the highest and equals 800 PVUs (300 PVUs for instance 2 + 500 PVUs for instance 3). The peak occurs during the period that is marked with a red square (it is the license peak value time). The peak usage for instance 1 is outside of the red square. It means that this instance was installed in the environment during the current reporting period but was not discovered during the license peak value time. This instance is not listed in the CSV report. \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=1]  \n\n\nWhy some values from the CSV report do not relate back to what is displayed on the user interface? \n\nWhen all values from column M (Physical Server PVU Subcapacity) for a particular product are added, the obtained value is greater that the value that is displayed in the user interface. It happens due to the way that data is presented in CSV reports and on the user interface. \n\nThe All IBM Metrics and IBM PVU subcapacity reports are multilevel, and consist of the following levels:\n1. First level: a list of all products\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=2] \n\n\n2. Second level: when you click a product name, you go to information about the physical server on which the product is installed.\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=3] \n\n \n\n3. Third level: when you click the server name, you go to a list of virtual machines that run on this server and have the product installed. \n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=4] \n\n\nThe audit snapshot is not multilevel. However, it has to present the same information that the report that is available in the user interface. Below is an excerpt from the audit snapshot that corresponds to the report that was presented on the screen shots above (some columns are hidden in the snapshot to simplify it).\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=5] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=5] \n\n \n\nWhen values in column M are added, PVU consumption equals 480 PVUs. However, these values should not be added because they all refer to a single server (TLM_VM_423\u2026) on which the four VMs run, not an individual VM that is listed in column P (Computer). \n\nThe value in column M is repeated due to the way data needs to be presented in a CSV file. If you want to relate back the value from column M in the audit snapshot to the user interface report, it is the value that you can see in the column PVU Subcapacity Limit on the second level of the report. The value in column L relates back to the column CPU Core Subcapacity on the second level of the report. \n\n \n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=6] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21688543&aid=6] \n\n\nPVU and RVU MAPC subcapacity license terms specify license consumption only on the physical server level. PVU and RVU MAPC values cannot be calculated and presented on the virtual machine or LPAR level, and such data is not provided by License Metric Tool or BigFix Inventory.

Applying fixpacks of WebSphere Application Server also upgrades the SDK that is packaged and bundled within the fixpack. Additionally, separate Java SDK fixpacks are also available that contain just the SDK updates which can be applied to upgrade the SDK.\n\nWebSphere Application Server V7.0\nAny V7.0 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.6.0 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\n\nWebSphere Application Server V6.1\nAny V6.1 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.5.0 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\n\nWebSphere Application Server V6.0\nAny V6.0 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.4.2 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\n\nWebSphere Application Server V5.1\nAny V5.1 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.4.1 and any V5.1.1 can be upgraded to the latest Java SDK 1.4.2 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\n\nWebSphere Application Server V5.0\nAny V5.0 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.3.1 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\n\n\n\nDetails of Java SDK Upgrade Policy\n\nWebSphere Application Server leverages the Java SDK as a base component. This results in unique support issues, including:\n\n\n * Matching Java SDK service releases to Application Server releases and fix packs\n   \n   \n * Delivering updates and fixes associated with the Java SDK on any given Application Server release.\n\n\nIn an effort to resolve customer Java SDK situations as quickly as possible, WebSphere Application Server Support has done a quickest-path-to-resolution analysis, determining the most direct way to collect problem information. \n\nIn some cases, problem resolution might include finding shortcuts to resolve symptoms. One shortcut is an immediate upgrade to a newer compatible Java SDK service release, before gathering detailed problem determination data. \n\nThere are multiple advantages to performing an immediate Java SDK upgrade as a quicker path to resolution over a full Problem Determination (PD) process: \n 1. There is a continuous stream of fixes going into the Java SDK. Many problems encountered by customers are resolved by these fixes.\n    \n    \n 2. When a new problem is encountered, applying the latest Java SDK is a quick way to determine if related fixes change the symptoms or correct the problem.\n    \n    \n 3. Many documented Java SDK fixes have common symptoms. Frequently, limited PD data does not isolate the problem to a single root cause.\n    \n\n\nThese factors highlight the advantage of applying a newer Java SDK before working through a full PD cycle. \n\nJava SDK and WebSphere Application Server software are updated frequently. To avoid compatibility issues for customers, WebSphere Application Server Support maintains this Java SDK Upgrade Policy. \n\nWebSphere Application Server Support details: \nhttp://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/support.html [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/support.html] \n\nIdentifying compatibility limitations between WebSphere Application Server releases and Java SDK service releases that have not been tested together reduces risk. \n\nImportant: Using a Java SDK not specifically packaged with WebSphere Application Server and supplied by IBM, or in violation of the Java SDK Upgrade Policy, is not supported by IBM WebSphere Application Server Support for Java SDK problems.

When the application is launched, the following errors are reported:\n\n\"The current license does not permit this job to continue.\"\n\nfollowed by...\n\n\"Error # 2070\nThe license server is down. Please check to see that the license server is running or ask your local SPSS coordinator to check the license server.\nThis command is not executed.\nSpecific symptom number: 3.\"\n\nThe Safenet Sentinel License Manager has been licensed and confirmed to be running. \nWhat is the problem? \n\nCAUSE\nThe above error can be caused by invalid values entered during the licensing phase of installing SPSS Statistics/Modeler or the client machine cannot reach the Sentinel License Manager host using the machine Hostname.\n\nANSWER\nPlease do the following to verify:\n\n1. Navigate to the IBM SPSS Statistics/Modeler directory and open \"spssprod.inf\", using any text editor. \n\n - By default, SPSS Statistics would store this file in: C:\\Program Files\\IBM\\SPSS\\Statistics\\xx\\ \n\n - By default, SPSS Modeler would store this file in: C:\\Program Files\\IBM\\SPSS\\Modeler\\xx.x\\bin\\\n\n2. Verify the \"DaemonHost\" value matches the Hostname or IP Address of the machine where the Safenet Sentinel License Manager is installed. \n\n - E.g. DaemonHost=MyLicenseServer or DaemonHost=127.0.0.1\n\nIf the DaemonHost value specifies redundant license servers, please do the following if you are using SPSS Statistics 22 (or earlier) or SPSS Modeler 16.0 (or earlier):\n\n\n a). Remove all license servers from the \"DaemonHost\" line and save the file.\n\nb). Create a system environment variable, called LSHOST, on each SPSS client with your redundant license servers as its value. Separate each redundant license server with a colon, e.g.\n==========================\nVariable: LSHOST\nValue: server1:server2:server3\n========================== \n\n\n\nIf the \"DaemonHost\" value is accurate and you are using a Hostname value, you have a name resolution problem. Error # 2070, Symptom number 3 typically means the SPSS client cannot connect to the name resolution database or the name resolution database does not contain a record for the machine where the SPSS Sentinel License Manager resides. To verify, please do the following:\n\n1. Run lswhere.exe (which is located in the SPSS directory, see above) from the problematic SPSS Client machine and take note of the displayed output. The following is an example of the output: \n\n\n==========================\nSentinel LM 8.x.x Search Tool For License Servers\nCopyright (C) 20xx Rainbow Technologies, Inc.\n\nServer Address : xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\nServer Name : Machine_A\n========================== \n\n\nIf the Safenet Sentinel License Manager machine is not listed or you encounter the error, \"Error[17]: Probably no servers are running on this subnet.\", please add the following system environment variable to the IBM SPSS Statistics/Modeler client and run lswhere.exe again: \n\n\n==========================\nVariable: LSHOST\nValue: Name or IP address of the License Manager machine \n========================== \n\n\nFor information about defining environment variables, see the Network License Administrator's Guide. If using the LSHOST environment variable does not render the Safenet Sentinel License Manager machine, try using LSFORCEHOST instead.\n\n2. When you see the Safenet Sentinel License Manager machine name and corresponding IP address listed in the lswhere output, ping the displayed Server Name from a command line, e.g.\n\n\n==========================\nping Machine_A\n========================== \n\n\nAn example of the resulting output is as follows:\n==========================\nUnknown host Machine_A\n========================== \n\n\nIf the ping command is unable to resolve the Server Name, you have a name resolution problem and must address it (with help from your IT Administrator/Help Desk team) before IBM SPSS Statistics/Modeler can acquire a license from the Sentinel License Manager.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Need more help?

A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt SSL sessions and access the plain text of encrypted connections. \n\nCVSS Base Score: 4.3\nCVSS Temporal Score: See https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97013 [https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97013] for the current score\nCVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined\nCVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) \n\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS\nThis vulnerability affects all versions and releases of IBM HTTP Server (IHS) component in all editions of WebSphere Application Server and bundling products.\n\n\nREMEDIATION/FIXES\nThere is no separate interim fix for the PI27904 APAR that is associated with this issue, but the interim fix for APAR PI31516 (TLS Padding Vulnerability CVE-2014-8730 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21692502]) includes the update for APAR PI27904. APAR PI27904 update disables SSLv3 by default for IHS 7.0 and newer, and adds the 'SSLProtocolEnable' directive into IHS 7.0. \n\nThe update for PI27904 will be included in fix packs 7.0.0.37, 8.0.0.10 and 8.5.5.4. \n\n\nWORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS\nFor all releases and versions of Apache based IBM HTTP Server, IBM recommends disabling SSLv3: \n\n\nAdd the following directive to the httpd.conf file to disable SSLv3 and SSLv2 for each context that contains \"SSLEnable\":\n\n# Disable SSLv3 for CVE-2014-3566\n# SSLv2 is disabled in V8R0 and later by default, and in typical V7\n# and earlier configurations disabled implicitly when SSLv3 ciphers \n# are configured with SSLCipherSpec.\nSSLProtocolDisable SSLv3 SSLv2\n\nStop and restart IHS for the changes to take affect.\n\nNote: \n\n * If you start IHS with the -f command line argument, or you use the \"Include\" directive to include alternate configuration files, you may need to search those filenames for SSLEnable.\n\n * If you configure SSL with SSLEnable in the global (non-virtualhost) scope, you will need to move SSLEnable into a virtualhost scope to add SSLProtocolDisable\n\n\nIBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas that enable SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation (such as disabling SSLv3) and remediation actions.

Expired certificates are removed at upgrade time.\n\nANSWER\nThe first step is to verify that the network is functioning correctly using these commands: \n\nshow int \n\nshow int mode \n\nshow route \n\n \n\nThose commands will show if there is any network activity as well as the ethernet link speed. \n\nOnce the network is confirmed, the quickest way to recover the web management and ssh services is to delete and recreate them with the default settings using the serial console. \n\nThe following commands will reset the RBM's, ACL's, WebGUI and SSH services to the default settings. \n\nNote: If the ssh is working, you may omit any commands with the ssh. \n\n \n\nconfig \n\nweb-mgmt \n\nno ssl \n\nexit \n\nwrite mem \n\ny \n\nno web-mgmt \n\nno ssh \n\nrbm \n\nreset \n\nexit \n\nacl web-mgmt \n\nreset \n\nexit \n\nacl ssh \n\nreset \n\nexit \n\nwrite mem (key step to remove the current settings) \n\ny \n\nweb-mgmt <ip to listen on or 0.0.0.0 for all> <port to use default is9090> \n\nssh <ip to listen on or 0.0.0.0 for all> <port to use default is22> \n\nwrite mem \n\ny \n\n \n\nOnce complete, test the service and confirm you can now access the appliance.

How do you resolve this issue? ", "document": {"content": " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n What should be done to prepare for upgrading an IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA 9235/9004 appliance to the 6.0.0 firmware?\n\n\nCAUSE\nThe DataPower 6.0.0 firmware requires more space then earlier firmware versions.\nSome generalizations say two or 2.5 times the firmware file size is needed to perform the upgrade. This is not true.\n\nMany factors impact firmware upgrade capability and many are noted in other technical documents such as the Firmware upgrade fails with 'incompatible platform flash capacity' error [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21506678] document.\n\nThe appliance has three basic file systems:\n\n\n *  Encrypted Temporary Internal space. \n\nAll three are used during a firmware upgrade. \nNote: The 6.0.1 firmware is not supported on an 9235/9004 appliance as noted in the 6.0.1 firmware release information [http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=AN&subtype=CA&htmlfid=897/ENUS213-584&appname=lenovous&language=en].\n\n\nANSWER\n \n\nBefore taking any steps, free up as much file system space as possible. \n\n1. Check the available file system free space using one of the methods below:  *  Use the following CLI commands:\n   top;co;show filesystem Via the WebGUI, in the Default domain, go to Status > System > Filesystem Information. Deleting unused or unneeded files, configuration objects and domains frees Encrypted space. Rebooting frees Temporary space. \n\n2. Set up a custom log target to monitor upgrade actions:  *  If there are concerns about possible configuration loss, issues, or there is a need to track the uprade actions should anything go wrong, a \"management\" type of log target saved to logstore://<RaidVolume> or even to a remote syslog/UDP may help. Configure this log target in the default domain. This management log target should not be saved to logtemp:// as files in this directory are deleted on each reboot. The following technote [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21497973]helps give suggestions on how the log target should be configured. \n\n3. After freeing up as much space as possible, the general steps for upgrading are:  *  Stop all traffic to the appliance (such as removing from an load balancer, disable domains, etc.). Reboot the appliance to free all available resources. Take a backup of the appliance, see this technote [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21416135] for additional information Check for expired keys and certificates as expired ones are deleted automatically at upgrade time. Note: If any expired certificates are in use, the objects or services that use the expired certificates are in the down state after the upgrade. Upload the new firmware image. Perform the \u201cboot image\u201d. \n\n4. Failed upgrades:  *  NOTE: After any failed upgrade attempt, immediately reboot the appliance to free resources taken by the upgrade attempt. \n\n *  Failure update due to not enough space for the upgrade  1. If errors like the following are seen, there is not enough space available for the upgrade:  1. Insufficient flash space - not enough space for the upgrade to complete \n        2. Failed to preserve user data - not enough space to create the \u201crollback image\u201d\n       \n       \n    2. If there is not enough space for the upgrade, consider the following steps based on your scenario:  1. Upgrade skips major releases:  * Major releases are identified by the first three numbers of the image name such as 4.0.1, 4.0.2, 5.0.0 etc. If the current firmware is 4.0.1.x, trying to upgrade directly to 6.0.0.x which skips major releases requires additional space to create the rollback image. This is explained in the File System technote [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21496334], \n            * To use less space while upgrading several major releases, perform a \u201cstepped\u201d upgrade by upgrading to each major release between the current level and the 6.0.0.x firmware. For example, upgrade from the:  1. 4.0.1.x firmware to 4.0.2.x \n               2. 4.0.2.x firmware to 5.0.0.x \n               3. 5.0.0.x firmware to 6.0.0.x.\n              \n              \n           \n           \n        2. Upgrading only one major release such as 5.0.0.x to 6.0.0.x and not enough space:  * Upgrade using a \u201cbase\u201d (no licenses/features) level of the target firmware such as xi6004.scrypt2. If the upgrade is successful, perform an \u201cin place\u201d upgrade to a level with the required features. For example, if upgrading to the 6.0.0.4 firmware on an appliance that uses thee ODBC and TIBCO licenses, use the xi6004.scrypt2 to upgrade. After that upgrade completes, upgrade again using the xi6004.odbc.tibco.scrypt2 image. \n            * To check your licenses/features from the:  1. CLI issue, the \u201cshow license\u201d command. \n               2. WebGUI, go to Status-> System -> Device Features.\n              \n               * Note: If the upgrade is done using a \u201cbase\u201d level and the appliance has additional features, the features are shown as \u201cEnabled\u201d but not \u201cAvailable\u201d. After the \u201cin place\u201d upgrade,the features show as both \u201cEnabled\u201d and \u201cAvailable\u201d.\n              \n              \n           \n           \n        3. If still not enough space, consider doing one or more of the following:  * Delete additional application domains and once the upgrade is complete, restore the domains from the backup taken at the start. Note: There is no guarantee there is enough space after the upgrade to restore all the application domains. \n            * Delete the rollback image. When an upgrade is done, a rollback image is created that allows you to rollback to the last firmware you upgraded from. If you delete the rollback image, it is not possible to rollback to the earlier firmware. \n            * Reinitialize the appliance to the 6.0.0.x firmware then restore from you backup.\n              See this technote [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21244384&loc=en_US&cs=utf-8&lang=en] for details on the reinitialize to factory settings.\n           \n           \n       \n       \n   \n   \n\n *   * \n   \n   \n\nIf you are still having issues please Contact IBM Support [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21236322]. \n\nAdditional information: \nConnecting to the serial console [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21663613] \nSecure backup/restore [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/1009_furbee/1009_furbee.html] \nSecure restore [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/1006_majikes/1006_majikes.html] \nFix Central download site [http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/] \nWebGUI fails after upgrade [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21498634]", "content_type": "text", "id": "swg21662595"}, "is_correct_answer": true, "is_correct_document": true, "origin": "gold-label", "answer": {"answer": ""}, "no_answer": true}, {"query": "\n\nWork with ILTM 9.2.7 / 9.5.4.38.
