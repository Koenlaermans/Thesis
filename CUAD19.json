Each Party, and any agent or representative of any Party acting at such Party's direction, on such Party's behalf, or for such Party's benefit, in any way related to this Agreement (collectively, \"Concerned Persons\"), will be familiar with and comply with (i) the provisions of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 78dcl-1 et seq.

Bunker One agrees, and any representative of Bunker One will agree, to hold in confidence any confidential information provided to or learned by it in connection with its rights under this section. The confidentiality provisions hereof will survive termination of the Term.\n\nSource: VERTEX ENERGY INC., 8-K, 1/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX A: (SEE INTERTEK REPORT OF ANALYSIS to include IFO-180, IFO-380 and DMA) APPENDIX B: Storage Agreement.

LMG will maintain, through the Conversion Date, its existing license for the CSC Software and provide TAG access to and an irrevocable \"look access only\" right and license to use the CSC Software and applicable Documentation. Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, TAG, LMG and CSC shall execute a nondisclosure and non-use agreement granting TAG a license in the CSC Software sufficient for TAG to perform the TPA Services and otherwise satisfy its obligations under the New Customer Contracts, Subcontracts and Administrative Services and Teaming Agreement (the \"CSC Agreement\"). TAG's use of, and LMG's rights regarding, the CSC Software will be governed by the terms of the CSC Agreement and not the terms of this Agreement. At TAG's request, LMG shall exercise and make available to TAG all rights and benefits available to it under LMG's existing license with CSC including LMG's rights to receive error corrections, support, maintenance and upgrades to or for the CSC Software.\n\nOther Third Party Software. LMG will maintain, through the Conversion Date or such other date as is specified in Exhibit A, its existing licenses for the Other Third Party Software and provide TAG access to and an irrevocable \"look access only\" right and license to use the Other Third Party Software and applicable Documentation. LMG, with the reasonable cooperation of TAG, will obtain from the applicable third party vendors all licenses, consents, authorizations and approvals that are necessary or appropriate for TAG to so Use the Other Third Party Software for purposes of performing the TPA Services and fulfilling its obligations under the New Customer Contracts, Subcontracts and Administrative Services and Teaming Agreement.  At TAG's request, LMG shall exercise and make available to TAG all rights and benefits available to it under LMG's existing license with the applicable third party vendors including LMG's rights to receive error corrections, support, maintenance and upgrades to or for the Other Third Party Software.\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Services. LMG shall provide the following with respect to the LMG Tools, CSC Software, Other Third Party Software and Documentation for the period specified in Exhibit A:\n\nLMG shall provide (or will cause the third party vendor to provide) to TAG all error corrections and all operational and support assistance necessary to cause the LMG Tools, CSC Software and Other Third Party Software to perform in accordance with their Applicable Specifications. LMG shall also provide remedial support designed to provide a by-pass or temporary fix to a defect until the defect can be permanently corrected.\n\nLMG shall provide (or will cause the third party vendor to provide) to TAG all upgrades, modifications, improvements, enhancements, extensions, and other changes to LMG Tools developed by LMG.\n\nLMG shall provide (or will cause the third party vendor to provide) to TAG any revisions to the existing Documentation developed for the LMG Tools, CSC Software and Other Third Party Software or necessary to reflect all corrections, updates, upgrades, modifications, improvements, enhancements, extensions or other changes thereto.\n\nLMG shall provide training to TAG with respect to the use of the LMG Tools, Other Third Party Software and Documentation as reasonably requested by TAG.\n\nHosting Services. LMG shall host the LMG Tools, CSC Software and Other Third Party Software at its existing data center facility in Petaluma, California for the period specified in Exhibit A. Except for downtime for scheduled maintenance, LMG shall make the LMG Tools, CSC Software and Other Third Party Software available to users between 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Notice of scheduled maintenance shall be provided to TAG via email at least ten (10) days before the scheduled maintenance. LMG shall be financially and operationally responsible for the hosting environment including maintenance, repair, replacement and upgrade, and the performance, availability, reliability, compatibility and interoperability of the LMG Tools, CSC Software, Other Third Party Software and hosting environment. LMG shall provide the hosting services through a dedicated telecommunications connection to TAG. The equipment, connectivity and other items located at LMG's existing data center facility in Petaluma, California that is described in Exhibit C to the Administrative Services and Teaming Agreement are included within the hosting environment and access to be provided by LMG under this Section 3.4.\n\nRetained LMG Personnel. LMG shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the employment of the LMG employees identified in Exhibit B (\"Retained Employees\") for the estimated retention period specified in Exhibit B or such other period as TAG may reasonably request (\"Retention Period\"). LMG shall cause them to devote the same amount of time and attention to the performance of the services under this Agreement as they presently devote to such services.  In all events, LMG shall retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel to perform the LMG Services. The Retained Employees shall be employees of LMG for all purposes.  LMG shall be solely responsible for funding and distributing benefits under the benefit plans in which the Retained Employees participate and for paying any compensation and remitting any income, disability, withholding and other employment taxes for such Retained Employees. For clarity, the foregoing shall not affect TAG's obligation to reimburse LMG for the costs specifically identified as reimbursable by TAG during the period, and under the terms and conditions, set forth in  Sections 4.1 and  4.2 of this Agreement.\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\nReports. LMG shall provide TAG with reports pertaining to the performance of the LMG Services and LMG's other obligations under this Agreement that permit TAG to perform the TPA Services and monitor and manage LMG's performance. Without limitation, TAG may identify reports to be generated by LMG and delivered to TAG on an ad hoc or periodic basis.\n\nSource Code. Upon TAG's request, LMG will promptly provide to TAG one copy of the most current version of the source code for the LMG Tools. Thereafter, LMG will promptly and continuously update and supplement the source code as necessary with all revisions, corrections, enhancements, and other changes that LMG has developed for the LMG Tools.  If LMG breaches this Agreement or no longer provides the LMG Services for the LMG Tools, then LMG or its authorized agent will promptly provide to TAG one copy of the most current version of the source code for the LMG Tools, the License shall include the right to Use the source code version of the LMG Tools received under this Section as necessary to modify, maintain, and update the LMG Tools in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\n\nContinued Performance. LMG understand that TAG requires Use of the LMG Tools, CSC Software, Other Third Party Software, Documentation and LMG Services in order to perform the TPA Services for the New Customers. Accordingly, LMG agrees that LMG will perform its obligations under this Article in a manner that does not degrade, diminish or otherwise interfere with the TPA Services or result in any default by, or liability of, TAG under the New Customer Contracts (including any default or liability with respect to service levels or quality of service). Without limitation, LMG shall not under any circumstance, even during a dispute, suspend, terminate, diminish or degrade the performance of the LMG Tools, CSC Software, Other Third Party Software or LMG Services, or attempt or threaten to do the same.\n\nARTICLE IV CHARGES\n\nReimbursement Generally.  In consideration of the LMG Services and other obligations to be performed by LMG under this Agreement, TAG will reimburse LMG for the following items.\n\nreasonable actual salary and direct benefits, consistent with past practice, paid to or on behalf of the Retained Employees during their Retention Period; provided that the total amount to be reimbursed under this Section 4.1(a) shall not exceed $783,367 per quarter, pro-rated for the number of days in any partial quarter of the Term,\n\nany retention bonuses, salary increases (including for replacement personnel) or other change agreed to by the parties, and\n\nduring the period between the Effective Date and the date specified in Exhibit A, the designated percentage identified in Exhibit A of the reasonable actual out-of-pocket costs for the CSC Software and Other Third Party Software provided that the total amount to be reimbursed under this Sections 4.1(c) and Section 4.2 of the Administrative Services and Teaming Agreement shall not exceed the applicable amount identified in Section 4.2 of the Administrative Services and Teaming Agreement.\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\nThe parties acknowledge that since not all of the Retained Employees will be dedicated solely to the performance of services under this Agreement, TAG will reimburse LMG only for a pro rata portion of the above-described salary and benefits based upon the documented and verifiable percentage of their working hours spent performing services for TAG.\n\n4.2 Conditions of Reimbursement.\n\nTAG shall have the right to approve any changes to the salary, benefits or other compensation of the Retained Employees and any new contracts, extensions or other changes to or for the items for which it is reimbursing LMG.  Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. LMG will advise TAG of any significant (i.e., more than ten percent (10%)) increase in any reimbursable costs, and TAG shall have the opportunity to require replacement or substitution of new or different sources for the items intended to achieve an overall lower cost.  LMG shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to minimize such costs and, as a condition to TAG's reimbursement obligations, shall provide such detail and documentation as TAG may reasonably request.\n\nLMG will invoice TAG monthly for its reasonable estimate of the amount due under Section 4.1 for that month. The first such invoice shall be delivered within five (5) days after the Effective Date and shall cover the period between the Effective Date and October 31, 2007. LMG shall reconcile the actual reimbursable costs incurred by TAG for the applicable month with such estimate in the invoice for the next month.\n\nTAG shall make payment within twenty (20) days after receipt of LMG's invoice. Any amount not paid when due will thereafter bear interest at the rate of one percent (1%) per month.\n\nTAG may contest, in good faith, any portion of an invoice and withhold payment of such contested amount, provided that TAG pays the portion of any invoice that it does not contest and attempts to try to resolve the dispute. Once the matter is resolved, TAG shall pay the agreed-upon amount within five (5) days thereafter.\n\nExcept as otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, there are no other or additional charges under this Agreement. LMG shall be responsible for all expenses that it may incur in connection with this Agreement. TAG agrees, however, to reimburse LMG for all reasonable and necessary travel and other out-of-pocket expenses that have been pre-approved by TAG in writing.\n\nExtension of Conversion Date. TAG and LMG expect that the Conversion Date will occur on or before October 31, 2009. TAG may extend the Conversion Date to a date that is six (6) months after transition of the TPA Services for the New Customers from LMG's software and systems to TAG's software and systems; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed as requiring the extension of the license to the CSC Software, which the parties acknowledge expires twenty-seven (27) months after the Effective Date under the terms of the CSC Agreement. TAG shall seek to give LMG at least ninety (90) days (but in no event shall provide less than sixty (60) days) prior notice of any such extension.  If the delay was caused by TAG, the parties shall negotiate and agree upon an equitable adjustment to the reimbursable items and limits thereon based upon LMG's increased costs of performing the LMG Services during the extension.\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE V WARRANTIES, INDEMNITIES, AND LIABILITIES\n\nWarranty. LMG represents and warrants that:\n\nThe LMG Tools, CSC Software, Other Third Party Software and Documentation are and shall be free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, and TAG shall be entitled to Use them without disturbance;\n\nNo portion of the LMG Tools, CSC Software and Other Third Party Software contains, at the time of delivery, any \"back door,\" \"time bomb,\" \"Trojan horse,\" \"worm,\" \"drop dead device,\" \"virus,\" or other computer software routines or hardware components designed to (i) permit access or Use of such software or TAG's computer systems by LMG or a third party not authorized by this Agreement, or (ii) disable, damage or erase the software or data;\n\nThe LMG Tools, CSC Software and Other Third Party Software and the design thereof shall not contain preprogrammed preventative routines or similar devices which prevent TAG from exercising the rights granted to TAG under this Agreement or from utilizing the software for the purpose for which they were designed; and\n\nEach item of LMG Tools and, to LMG's knowledge, the CSC Software and Other Third Party Software (i) shall be free from defects and (ii) shall function properly under ordinary Use and operate in conformance with its Applicable Specifications and Documentation.\n\nDuring the period specified in Exhibit A, LMG will provide warranty service to TAG at no additional charge and will include all LMG Services or replacement software necessary to enable LMG to comply with the warranties set forth in this Agreement.\n\n5.2 LMG Infringement Indemnification\n\nLMG represents and warrants that (i) no LMG Tools, CSC Software, Other Third Party Software or Documentation provided under this Agreement is the subject of any claim, dispute, demand or litigation (\"Claim\"), and (ii) LMG has all right, title, ownership interest, and/or  rights necessary to provide such software and Documentation to TAG and that the License, the LMG Tools and Documentation and their license and Use hereunder do not and shall not directly or indirectly violate or infringe upon any copyright, patent, trade secret, or other proprietary or intellectual property right of any third party or contribute to such violation or infringement (\"Infringement\"). LMG shall indemnify and hold TAG, its affiliates and their respective successors, officers, directors, employees, and agents harmless from and against any and all actions, claims, losses, damages, liabilities, awards, costs, and expenses including legal fees (\"Losses\") resulting from or arising out of any breach or claimed breach of the foregoing warranties, or which is based on a claim of an Infringement and LMG shall defend and settle, at its expense, all suits or proceedings arising therefrom. TAG shall inform LMG of any such Claim against TAG and shall have the right to participate in the defense of any such suit or proceeding at its expense and through counsel of its choosing.\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\nLMG shall notify TAG of any Claims against LMG based on an alleged Infringement of any party's intellectual property rights in and to the LMG Tools, CSC Software, Other Third Party Software or Documentation. In the event an injunction is sought or obtained against Use thereof or in TAG's opinion is likely to be sought or obtained, LMG shall promptly, at its option and expense, either (i) procure for TAG the right to continue to Use the infringing software or Documentation as set forth in this Agreement, or (ii) replace or modify the infringing software or Documentation to make its Use non-infringing while being capable of performing the same function without degradation of performance.\n\nLMG's indemnification obligations under this Section 5.2 will expire twelve (12) months after the Conversion Date.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, LMG shall have no liability or obligation to any of the TAG ndemnities under this  Section 5.2 to the extent the claim of Infringement is caused by TAG's contributions to, misuse of or unauthorized modification of such item.\n\n5.3 TAG Indemnification\n\nTAG shall indemnify and hold LMG, its affiliates and their respective successors, officers, directors, employees, and agents harmless from and against any and all Losses resulting from or arising out of (i) any Infringement by software provided by TAG or PSC or (ii) TAG's contributions to, misuse of or unauthorized modification of LMG Tools, CSC Software, Other Third Party Software or Documentation provided by LMG under this Agreement; provided, however, that TAG shall have no obligation under this Section to the extent (A) the claim or Infringement was the result of LMG's failure to obtain the required consents or approvals for which it is responsible, (B) LMG failed to provide written notice of the duties, obligations or restrictions to which TAG is subject, or (C) TAG's contributions to, use of, modification or other activities is consistent in all material respects with LMG's activities in the twelve (12) months prior to the Effective Date. TAG shall defend and settle, at its expense, all suits or proceedings arising therefrom. LMG shall inform TAG of any such Claim against LMG and shall have the right to participate in the defense of any such suit or proceeding at its expense and through counsel of its choosing.\n\nTAG shall notify LMG of any Claims against TAG described in Section 5.3(a). In the event an injunction is sought or obtained against Use of software provided by TAG or PSC, or in LMG's opinion is likely to be sought or obtained, TAG shall promptly, at its option and expense, either (i) procure for LMG the right to continue to Use the infringing software, or (ii) replace or modify the infringing software to make its Use non-infringing while being capable of performing the same function without degradation of performance.\n\nTAG's indemnification obligations under this Section 5.3 will expire twelve (12) months after the Conversion Date.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, TAG shall have no liability or obligation to any of the LMG ndemnities under this  Section 5.3 to the extent the claim of Infringement is caused by LMG's contributions to, misuse of or unauthorized modification of such item.\n\nOther Indemnification.  LMG shall indemnify and hold TAG, its affiliates and their respective successors, officers, directors, employees, and agents harmless from and against any and all Losses resulting from or arising out of any Claim by New Customers arising from or relating to a breach of LMG's obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, LMG shall not be responsible for the claims based upon breach of new or additional obligations agreed to by TAG and the New Customers after the Effective Date without the prior approval of LMG; provided that\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\nthe service levels in the New Customer Contracts, which are based upon, the service levels being achieved by LMG as of the effective date shall not be considered new or additional obligations.  LMG shall defend and settle, at its expense, all suits or proceedings arising therefrom. TAG shall inform LMG of any such Claim against TAG and shall have the right to participate in the defense of any such suit or proceeding at its expense and through counsel of its choosing.\n\nLimitation of Liability. Neither party shall be liable to the other pursuant to this Agreement for any amounts representing loss of profit, loss of business or indirect, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages of the other party.  The foregoing shall not limit the indemnification, defense and hold harmless obligations set forth in this Agreement other than those set forth in Section 5.4 and shall not apply with respect to damages or losses arising from the wrongful termination of this Agreement by LMG, willful misconduct, gross negligence or breach of LMG's obligations under Section 3. 8.\n\n5.6 Insurance\n\nDuring the Term of the Agreement, LMG shall maintain and keep in force, at its own expense, the following minimum insurance coverages and minimum limits:\n\nworkers' compensation insurance, with statutory limits as required by the various laws and regulations applicable to the employees of LMG;\n\nemployer's liability insurance, for employee bodily injuries and deaths, with a limit of $500,000 each accident;\n\ncommercial general liability insurance, covering claims for bodily injury, death and property damage, including premises and operations, LMG's vicarious liability for acts of independent contractors, products, services and completed operations (as applicable to the Services), personal injury, contractual, and broad-form property damage liability coverages, with combined single limit of $1,000,000 per occurrence, and a general aggregate limit of $2,000,000, for bodily injury, death and property damage;\n\ncommercial automobile liability insurance, covering owned, non-owned and hired vehicles, with combined single limit of $1,000,000 per occurrence;\n\numbrella liability insurance, with a minimum limit of $5,000,000 per occurrence and $5,000,000 in the aggregate;\n\nspecial form property insurance, on a replacement cost basis, covering the real and personal property of LMG which LMG is obligated to insure by the Agreement; such real and personal property may include equipment, furniture, fixtures and supply inventory; and\n\nemployee dishonesty insurance covering dishonest acts of employees; such insurance shall include a Joint Loss Endorsement in favor of TAG and be written for limits not less than $500,000.\n\nAll such policies of insurance of LMG shall provide that the insurer will give at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of cancellation to TAG. No such cancellation or material modification shall affect LMG's obligation to maintain the insurance coverages required by the Agreement. TAG shall be named as an additional insured on the commercial general liability insurance policies described above. All liability insurance policies shall be written on an \"occurrence\" policy form except for the policies described in (vii) and (viii) above\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich shall be on a \"claims made\" basis. TAG shall be named as loss payee as its interest may appear on the property insurance policies of LMG. LMG shall be responsible for payment of any and all deductibles from insured claims under its policies of insurance. All required policies of insurance will be placed with insurers with no less than an A.M. Best rating of A- VII. The coverage afforded under any insurance policy obtained by LMG pursuant to the Agreement shall be primary coverage regardless of whether or not TAG has similar coverage. LMG shall not perform under the Agreement without the prerequisite insurance. Upon TAG's request, LMG shall provide TAG with certificates of such insurance including renewals thereof.\n\nThe parties do not intend to shift all risk of loss to insurance. The naming of TAG as additional insured is not intended to be a limitation of LMG's liability and shall in no event be deemed to, or serve to, limit LMG's liability to TAG to available insurance coverages or to the policy limits specified in this Section 5.6 nor to limit TAG's rights to exercise any and all remedies available to TAG under contract, at law or in equity.\n\nSurvival of Article V. The provisions of this Article V shall survive the term or termination of this Agreement for any reason.\n\nARTICLE VI TERMINATION\n\nTerm. This Agreement shall become effective as of the Effective Date and, unless terminated under this Article, shall continue in effect until the Conversion Date (the \"Term\"); provided that, with respect to any LMG Tools identified in Exhibit A as having a license term beyond the Conversion Date, TAG's License to, and LMG's obligation to provide LMG Services for, such LMG Tools shall survive for the period specified in Exhibit A.\n\nTermination for Cause. In the event that either party materially defaults in the performance of its duties or obligations set forth in this Agreement, and such default is not cured within thirty (30) days after written notice is given to the defaulting party specifying the default, then the party not in default may, by giving written notice thereof to the defaulting party, terminate the Agreement as of a date specified in such notice of termination.\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\nTermination for Insolvency or Bankruptcy. Either party may immediately terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the other party in the event of (a) the liquidation or insolvency of the other party, (b) the appointment of a receiver or similar officer for the other party, (c) an assignment by the other party for the benefit of all or substantially all of its creditors, (d) entry by the other party into an agreement for the composition, extension, or readjustment of all or substantially all of its obligations, or (e) the filing of a meritorious petition in bankruptcy by or against the other party under any bankruptcy or debtors' law for its relief or reorganization.\n\nTermination Assistance. Commencing upon a notice of termination under Section 6.2 or 6.3 (including notice based upon default by TAG) and continuing for a period, designated by TAG, of up to twelve (12) months thereafter, LMG shall provide to TAG the reasonable termination assistance requested by TAG to allow the LMG Services to continue without interruption or adverse effect and to facilitate the orderly transfer of the LMG Services to TAG or its designee (\"Termination Assistance\"). Termination Assistance shall include the following:\n\nLMG shall provide all such information and assistance as may be necessary for TAG to transition off using the LMG Tools, CSC Software and Other Third Party Software or to install and implement the same.\n\nLMG shall provide TAG with an extract of the Customer Data, including, without limitation, all policyholder and New Customer data.\n\nTAG shall be permitted to undertake, without interference from LMG, to hire any Retained Employees. LMG shall waive its rights, if any, under contracts with such personnel restricting the ability of such personnel to be recruited or hired by TAG; provided that counter-offers and making available positions posted through LMG's placement system and generally available to other LMG employees shall not be prohibited under this Section.  TAG shall have reasonable access to such personnel for interviews and recruitment.\n\nTAG's License to the LMG Tools and subject to the terms of the applicable third party license, CSC Software and Other Third Party Software and Documentation shall survive the termination for the period specified in Exhibit A, and LMG shall provide copies of all Documentation relevant to such license which is in LMG' possession.\n\nAt TAG's request, LMG shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to assign to TAG its license for the CSC Software and any third party licenses for Other Third Party Software, and TAG shall assume the obligations under such licenses that relate to periods after such date. LMG shall also provide all Documentation relevant to such licenses which is in LMG's possession.\n\nAt TAG's request (i) assign to TAG leases and other contracts for some or all of the leased equipment included in the hosting environment or otherwise used to provide the LMG Services, and TAG shall assume the obligations under such leases that relate to periods after such date; and (ii) sell to TAG, at LMG's then current book value, some or all of such items owned by LMG. LMG shall also provide all Documentation relevant to such item which is in LMG's possession.\n\nLMG shall obtain any necessary rights and thereafter make available to TAG, pursuant to reasonable terms and conditions, any third party services then being utilized by LMG in the performance of the LMG Services.\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Parties contemplate that the activities described in this  Section 6.4 shall be completed before the Conversion Date as contemplated in the Administrative Services and Teaming Agreement (i.e., in the ordinary course of the transition projects described therein). If, however, any activities are not completed before the Conversion Date, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary and regardless of whether there has been notice of termination under Section 6.2 or 6.3, LMG shall complete any such activities that are reasonably requested by TAG before the Conversion Date.  LMG's obligations under the foregoing sentence shall survive the expiration of the Term.\n\nReimbursement for Termination Assistance.\n\nExcept as provided in this  Section 6.5, LMG shall perform or provide the Termination Assistance at no additional cost to TAG; provided that for clarity, the foregoing shall not affect TAG's obligation to reimburse LMG for the applicable costs specifically identified as reimbursable by TAG during the period, and under the terms and conditions, set forth in  Sections 4.1 and  4.2 of this Agreement and Section 4.2 of the Administrative Services and Teaming Agreement.  The Parties anticipate that, to the extent possible, the Termination Assistance requested by TAG will be provided by LMG using LMG personnel already performing the LMG Services. If Termination Assistance requested by TAG cannot be provided by LMG using such personnel (or incur costs that LMG would not otherwise incur in the performance of the LMG Services under this Agreement), LMG shall promptly notify TAG of such fact and advise TAG of the required personnel or costs. TAG, in its sole discretion, may forego or delay any work activities or temporarily or permanently adjust the work to be performed by LMG or the schedules associated therewith to permit the performance of such Termination Assistance using such personnel and without additional cost. To the extent TAG authorizes LMG to use additional LMG personnel or incur additional cost to perform material Termination Assistance activities requested by TAG, TAG shall reimburse LMG for its reasonable actual out-of-pocket costs; provided LMG notifies TAG of such costs in advance and TAG's reimbursement shall be subject to the reporting and other conditions set forth in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 of this Agreement and Section 4.2 of the Administrative Services and Teaming Agreement.\n\nLMG will provide Termination Assistance regardless of the reason for the termination; provided that if the LMG terminates this Agreement under Section 6.2 as a result of TAG's failure to pay amounts due LMG under this Agreement or under Section 6.3 as a result of TAG insolvency, LMG may require TAG to pay monthly, in advance, for any costs specifically identified in this Agreement as reimbursable by TAG during the period of Termination Assistance. To the extent TAG is obligated to pay in advance, LMG shall, prior to each month, provide TAG with a reasonable written estimate of the reimbursable costs for such month and LMG shall reconcile the actual reimbursable costs incurred by TAG with such estimate in the invoice for the next month.\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE VII CONFIDENTIALITY\n\nGeneral. Each party (a \"Receiving Party\") agrees that all Confidential Information provided or otherwise made available under this Agreement by the other party (a \"Disclosing Party\") will be treated as confidential, regardless of whether marked or described as Confidential Information, and all confidentiality notices on that Confidential Information will be retained. In avoiding unauthorized disclosure or use of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, the Receiving Party will use at least the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, as it employs concerning its own Confidential Information of similar importance.\n\nDefinition.  \"Confidential Information\" shall mean, with respect to a party, all non-public written, electronic, and oral proprietary information communicated to the other party (or obtained by such other party while at the party's premises) during the Term in connection with this Agreement including information relating to a party's products, services, designs, methodologies, business plans, finances, marketing plans, customers or prospects  and the terms of this Agreement.  Confidential Information will not include information that (a) was known by the Receiving Party without an obligation of confidentiality before its receipt from the Disclosing Party, (b) is independently developed by the Receiving Party, (c) is or becomes publicly available without a breach by the Receiving Party of this Agreement, or (d) is disclosed to the Receiving Party by a third person who is not required to maintain its confidentiality.\n\nDisclosure. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information only to its own officers, directors, and employees and to its consultants, subcontractors, and advisors who reasonably need to know it for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement. The Receiving Party will be responsible to the Disclosing Party for any violation of the provisions of this Article VII by its officers, directors, employees, consultants, subcontractors or advisors.\n\nUse. The Receiving Party may not use the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information for any purpose not in furtherance of this Agreement, unless it obtains the Disclosing Party's prior written authorization.\n\nReproduction. Except as otherwise provided in writing between the Parties, the Receiving Party may not print, copy or reproduce in any way, in whole or in part, any documents or other media containing the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, other than copies for its officers, directors, employees, consultants or advisors who reasonably need to know it for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.\n\nRequired Disclosure. If the Receiving Party is requested to disclose any of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information as part of an administrative or judicial proceeding or pursuant to any government or securities exchange rule or regulation, the Receiving Party will, promptly notify the Disclosing Party of that request and cooperate with the Disclosing Party, at the Disclosing Party's expense, in seeking a protective order or similar confidential treatment for the Confidential Information.  If no protective order or other confidential treatment is obtained, the Receiving Party will (a) disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed based on the opinion of its counsel and (b) use reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information so disclosed.\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE VIII DATA\n\nDefinition. \"Customer Data\" shall mean any data or information of any New Customer or of TAG created under a New Customer Contract that is provided to or obtained by LMG in connection with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including data and information with respect to the businesses, policyholders, customers, operations, products, rates, regulatory compliance and finances of any New Customer. Customer Data shall also include any data or information pertaining to any New Customer created, generated, collected or processed by LMG in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.\n\nTAG Ownership of Customer Data. Customer Data is and shall remain the property of TAG and/or the applicable New Customers. LMG shall promptly deliver Customer Data (or the portion of such Customer Data specified by TAG) to TAG in the format and on the media in which it exists as of the date of the request or in such other format or media as TAG reasonably requests. Upon TAG's request, LMG shall return, destroy or securely erase, as directed by TAG, all copies of the Customer Data in LMG's possession or under LMG's control within thirty (30) business days. LMG shall not withhold Customer Data under any circumstance including as a means of resolving a dispute.

This Agreement shall be binding on the parties and their respective successors in interest and assigns, but neither party shall have the power to assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party.

If TAG grants such consent, LMG shall remain fully responsible for complete performance of all of LMG's obligations set forth in this Agreement and for any such third party's compliance with the confidentiality and other provisions set forth in this Agreement.\n\nMedia Releases. Except for any announcement intended solely for internal distribution by a party or any disclosure required by legal, accounting, or regulatory requirements beyond the reasonable control of the party, all media releases, public announcements, or public disclosures (including, but not limited to, promotional or marketing material) by a party, its affiliates, employees or agents relating to this Agreement or its subject matter, or including the name, trade name, trade mark, or symbol of a party or any affiliate of a party, shall be coordinated with and approved in writing by that party prior to the release thereof.\n\nNotices. All notices which are required to be given pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered by first class mail postage prepaid, sent by overnight express or similarly recognized overnight delivery with receipt acknowledged or by facsimile, with a copy thereof sent by one of the other means.

The term \"Force Majeure\" shall mean fires or other casualties or accidents, acts of God, severe weather conditions, strikes or labor disputes, war or other violence, or any law, order, proclamation, regulation, ordinance, demand, or requirement of any governmental agency. A party whose performance is prevented, restricted, or interfered with by reason of a Force Majeure condition shall be excused from such performance to the extent of such Force Majeure condition so long as such party provides the other party with prompt written notice describing the Force Majeure condition and takes all reasonable steps to avoid or remove such causes of nonperformance and immediately continues performance whenever and to the extent such causes are removed.\n\nSeverability. If, but only to the extent that, any provision of this Agreement is declared or found to be illegal, unenforceable, or void, then both parties shall be relieved of all obligations arising under such provision, it being the intent and agreement of the parties that this Agreement shall be deemed amended by modifying such provision to the extent necessary to make it legal and enforceable while preserving its intent. If that is not possible, another provision that is legal and enforceable and achieves the same objective shall be substituted.  If the remainder of this Agreement is not affected by such declaration or finding and is capable of substantial performance, then the remainder shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.\n\nDispute Resolution. In the event of any disagreement regarding performance under or interpretation of this Agreement and prior to the commencement of any formal proceedings, the parties shall continue performance as set forth in this Agreement and shall attempt in good faith to reach a negotiated resolution by designating a representative of appropriate authority to resolve the dispute.\n\nWaiver. Any waiver of this Agreement or of any covenant, condition, or agreement to be performed by a party under this Agreement shall (a) only be valid if the waiver is in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the party against which such waiver is sought to be enforced, and (b) apply only to the specific covenant, condition or agreement to be performed, the specific instance or specific breach thereof and not to any other instance or breach thereof or subsequent instance or breach.\n\nRemedies. All remedies set forth in this Agreement, or available by law or equity shall be cumulative and not alternative, and may be enforced concurrently or from time to time. If LMG breaches its obligations under Section 3.8, TAG will be irreparably harmed. In such a circumstance, TAG may proceed directly to court and, without any additional findings of irreparable injury or other conditions to injunctive relief, LMG shall not oppose the entry of an order compelling performance by LMG and restraining it from any further breaches. In addition to any other remedies available under this Agreement, with respect to any amounts to be paid or reimbursed by TAG or PSC hereunder or under the LMG Documents that are not paid or reimbursed when due, TAG and/ or PSC may, upon ten (10) days prior notice, set off against such amount any amount that LMG is obligated to pay or credit to TAG or PSC hereunder or under the LMG Documents.  For clarity, the foregoing shall not apply to, and TAG and PSC shall not seek to set-off against, commission payments to be paid to LMG producers and agents and other amounts held by TAG in its administrative capacity under the New Customer Contracts and Subcontracts.\n\nCompliance with Laws. In the performance of LMG Services or the provision of LMG Tools and Documentation pursuant to this Agreement, LMG shall comply with the requirements of all applicable laws, ordinances, and regulations of the United States or any state, country, or other governmental entity. LMG shall indemnify, defend, and hold TAG harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, or damages arising from or caused by LMG's failure to comply with the foregoing.\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\nSurvival of Terms. Termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason shall not release either party from any liabilities or obligations set forth in this Agreement which (a) the parties have expressly agreed shall survive any such termination or expiration, or (b) remain to be performed or by their nature would be intended to be applicable following any such termination or expiration.\n\nGOVERNING LAW. THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT BE GOVERNED BY THE PROVISIONS OF THE 1980 UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS. RATHER THESE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS, OTHER THAN CHOICE OF LAW RULES, OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA.\n\nUnauthorized Representations and Relationship of the Parties.  Neither party shall (a) represent that this Agreement or the relationship created by this Agreement covers more than is specifically agreed to by the parties or (b) without the other party's prior written consent, make any representations or create any warranties, express or implied, concerning such other party or its products or services. This Agreement shall not constitute or create a joint venture, partnership or formal business organization of any kind. The parties shall be independent contractors, and the employees of one shall not be employees or agents of the other.\n\nNo Third Party Beneficiaries. The parties do not intend this Agreement to create any rights enforceable by a third party.\n\nConstruction. Unless herein otherwise provided, or unless the context shall otherwise require, references to Articles, Sections, and other subdivisions refer to the Articles, Sections, and other subdivisions of this Agreement. The term \"or\" will not be interpreted as excluding any of the items described. The term \"include\" or any derivative of such term does not mean that the items following such term are the only types of such items.  Neither this Agreement nor any provision contained in this Agreement will be interpreted in favor of or against any party hereto because such party or its legal counsel drafted this Agreement or such provision.\n\nEntire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire and exclusive statement of the agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter and there are no oral or written representations, understandings or agreements relating to this Agreement which are not fully expressed in the Agreement.

(a) Approvals and Notifications for SpinCo IP Assets. To the extent that the transfer or assignment of any SpinCo IP Asset or the assumption of any SpinCo IP Liability requires Approvals or Notifications, the Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain or make such Approvals or Notifications as soon as reasonably practicable; provided, however, that, except to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement or as otherwise agreed in writing between Parent and SpinCo, neither Parent nor SpinCo shall be obligated to contribute capital or pay any consideration in any form (including providing any letter of credit, guaranty or other financial accommodation) to any Person in order to obtain or make such Approvals or Notifications.   (b) Delayed SpinCo Transfers. If and to the extent that the valid, complete and perfected transfer or assignment to the SpinCo Group of any SpinCo IP Asset or assumption by the SpinCo Group of any SpinCo IP Liability would be a violation of applicable Law or require any Approvals or Notifications in connection with the Separation that has not been obtained or made by the Effective Time, then, unless the Parties shall otherwise mutually agree\n\n  -6-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  in writing, the transfer or assignment to the SpinCo Group of such SpinCo IP Assets or the assumption by the SpinCo Group of such SpinCo IP Liabilities, as the case may be, shall be automatically deemed deferred and any such purported transfer, assignment or assumption shall be null and void until such time as all legal impediments are removed or such Approvals or Notifications have been obtained or made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such SpinCo IP Assets or SpinCo IP Liabilities shall continue to constitute SpinCo IP Assets and SpinCo IP Liabilities for all other purposes of this Agreement.   (c) Treatment of Delayed SpinCo IP Assets and Delayed SpinCo IP Liabilities. If any transfer or assignment of any SpinCo IP Asset (or a portion thereof) or any assumption of any SpinCo IP Liability (or a portion thereof) intended to be transferred, assigned or assumed hereunder, as the case may be, is not consummated on or prior to the Effective Time, whether as a result of the provisions of Section 2.3(b) or for any other reason (any such SpinCo IP Asset (or a portion thereof), a \"Delayed SpinCo IP Asset\" and any such SpinCo IP Liability (or a portion thereof), a \"Delayed SpinCo IP Liability\"), then, insofar as reasonably possible and subject to applicable Law, the member of the Parent Group retaining such Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or such Delayed SpinCo IP Liability, as the case may be, shall thereafter hold such Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or Delayed SpinCo IP Liability, as the case may be, for the use and benefit of the member of the SpinCo Group entitled thereto (at the expense of the member of the SpinCo Group entitled thereto). In addition, the member of the Parent Group retaining such Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or such Delayed SpinCo IP Liability shall, insofar as reasonably possible and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, treat such Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or Delayed SpinCo IP Liability in the ordinary course of business in accordance with past practice and take such other actions as may be reasonably requested by the member of the SpinCo Group to whom such Delayed SpinCo IP Asset is to be transferred or assigned, or which will assume such Delayed SpinCo IP Liability, as the case may be, in order to place such member of the SpinCo Group in a substantially similar position as if such Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or Delayed SpinCo IP Liability had been transferred, assigned or assumed as contemplated hereby and so that all the benefits and burdens relating to such Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or Delayed SpinCo IP Liability, as the case may be, including use, non- abandonment, avoidance from contribution to the public domain, risk of loss, potential for gain, and dominion, control and command over such Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or Delayed SpinCo IP Liability, as the case may be, and all costs and expenses related thereto, shall inure from and after the Effective Time to the SpinCo Group.   (d) Transfer of Delayed SpinCo IP Assets and Delayed SpinCo IP Liabilities. If and when the Approvals or Notifications, the absence of which caused the deferral of transfer or assignment of any Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or the deferral of assumption of any Delayed SpinCo IP Liability pursuant to  Section 2.3(b), are obtained or made, and, if and when any other legal or other impediments for the transfer or assignment of any Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or the assumption of any Delayed SpinCo IP Liability have been removed, the transfer or assignment of the applicable Delayed SpinCo IP Asset or the assumption of the applicable Delayed SpinCo IP Liability, as the case may be, shall be effected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and/or the applicable Ancillary Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable.   (e) Costs for Delayed SpinCo IP Assets and Delayed SpinCo IP Liabilities.

LICENSES   3.1 License Grant to Parent. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, SpinCo hereby grants to each individual member of the Parent Group, on behalf of itself and the other members of the SpinCo Group, and shall cause the other members of the SpinCo Group to grant to each individual member of the Parent Group, a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free right and license, for use in the Parent Field, to (i) use, reproduce, distribute, display, perform, make Improvements and exploit the Licensed SpinCo IP, and (ii) make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell and import any goods and services incorporating, embodying or utilizing the Licensed SpinCo IP. The foregoing license shall be transferable or sublicensable by Parent Group solely to a Permitted Party, and, subject to the restrictions herein, with any sale or transfer of a Parent business that utilizes the Licensed SpinCo IP. Any such transfer or sublicense shall require the Permitted Party or, in the case of a sale or transfer of a Parent business, the transferee, to agree pursuant to a written agreement to maintain any trade secrets and Information included in the Licensed SpinCo IP in strict confidence. Such agreement shall prohibit any further sublicensing or transfer of rights by the Permitted Party, or, in the case of a sale or transfer of a Parent business, the transferee, or any use of the Licensed SpinCo IP outside the scope of the license granted to Parent herein. Parent shall remain responsible and liable for the Permitted Parties' exercise of any rights sublicensed hereunder and any use of the Licensed SpinCo IP by such Permitted Party outside of the permitted scope of the license. Parent shall enforce material breaches of the terms of any such sublicense of rights and notify SpinCo of any material violation thereof by a Permitted Party. If Parent enters an agreement to transfer the license granted to it under this Section 3.1 in connection with any sale or transfer of a Parent business, then SpinCo and members of the SpinCo Group shall be made third party beneficiaries under such transfer agreement to enforce breaches of the license.   3.2 License Grant to SpinCo. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent hereby grants to each individual member of the SpinCo Group, on behalf of itself and the other members of the Parent Group, and shall cause the other members of the Parent Group to grant to each individual member of the SpinCo Group, a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free right and license, solely for use in the SpinCo Field, to (i)\n\n  -9-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  use, reproduce, distribute, display, perform, make improvements and exploit Intellectual Property owned or controlled by Parent or a member of the Parent Group and currently used in the SpinCo Business, and (ii) make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell and import any goods and services incorporating, embodying or utilizing such Intellectual Property currently used in the SpinCo Business. Such license shall be transferrable subject to the foregoing restriction with any sale or transfer of a SpinCo business that utilizes such Intellectual Property, but, for the avoidance of doubt, such license shall not otherwise be sublicensable or transferable. Any transfer by SpinCo or a member of its Group shall require the transferee to agree pursuant to a written agreement to maintain any trade secrets and Information included in the transferred Intellectual Property in strict confidence. Such agreement shall prohibit any further transfer of rights by such party or any use of the transferred Intellectual Property outside the scope of the license granted to SpinCo herein. If SpinCo enters an agreement to transfer the license granted to it under this  Section 3.2  in connection with any sale or transfer of a SpinCo business, then Parent and members of the Parent Group shall be made third party beneficiaries under such transfer agreement to enforce breaches of the license.   3.3 Neither Party shall make a trade secret of the other Party public or otherwise destroy or impair the trade secret status of such trade secret without the express, advance, written consent of the other Party. Any agreement by which a trade secret is transferred or sublicensed shall be subject to the same confidentiality requirements as stated herein.   3.4 No Implied Rights. As between the Parties, all right, title and interest in and to all Licensed SpinCo IP shall be owned by SpinCo and the other members of the SpinCo Group, and Parent shall not acquire, and nothing contained herein shall be construed as conferring, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, any license or other right, title or interest in or to such Licensed SpinCo IP or any other Intellectual Property owned by SpinCo or of any of its Group, except for the license granted to Parent pursuant to Section 3.1.   3.5 Improvements. For the avoidance of doubt, as between the Parties, Parent shall own all right, title and interest in and to any and all Improvements authored, developed, invented, reduced to practice or otherwise created by Parent or any member of the Parent Group and all Intellectual Property rights therein and thereto.   3.6 Enforcement of Licensed IP.   (a) Control of Enforcement IP Actions. Except as may otherwise be mutually agreed by the Parties, as between the Parties, SpinCo shall have the right to enforce the Licensed SpinCo IP as follows:   (i)  SpinCo shall have the right, but not the obligation (through itself and/or through its designee), to control the initiation, conduct and, subject to this  Section 3.6, settlement or other resolution, at its cost and expense and in its sole discretion, of any enforcement claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil or criminal or in law or in equity (each, an \"IP Action\") relating to the Licensed SpinCo IP, including the right to communicate any objection or other form of challenge to any Third Party; and\n\n  -10-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (ii)  if SpinCo does not initiate such an IP Action itself or through its designee with respect to infringement, misappropriation or other violation of any Licensed SpinCo IP within the Parent Field by a Third Party within ninety (90) days after receipt of a written request from Parent to assume control over the enforcement of such violation of such Licensed SpinCo IP inside the Parent Field, then Parent shall have, with the prior consent of SpinCo, which will not be unreasonably withheld, the right, but not the obligation, to bring and to control such IP Action (provided that if Parent does not do so within thirty (30) days after the end of such original ninety (90) day-deadline, the right to initiate and control an IP Action shall revert back to SpinCo and shall again be subject to the terms set forth above). For avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not have any right to initiate any IP Action with respect to infringement, misappropriation or other violation of any Licensed SpinCo IP by a Third Party except within the Parent Field.   (b) Enforcement Action Process.   (i) The Party initiating or otherwise controlling any enforcement IP Action hereunder (the \"Enforcing Party\"), including the right to communicate any objection or other form of challenge to any Third Party, shall, as between the Parties, have the right to select counsel for any IP Action initiated by it or its designee pursuant to this Section 3.6. The Party that is not the Enforcing Party (the \"Non-Enforcing Party\") shall, to the extent it is a necessary party to the IP Action (or is otherwise reasonably requested by the enforcing Party), join the Enforcing Party (and/or, if applicable, its designee(s)) at the Enforcing Party's expense and agree to be represented by counsel for the Enforcing Party in any infringement or other IP Action commenced by the Enforcing Party (or its designee) and shall, upon request of the Enforcing Party, execute such documents and perform such other acts as may be reasonably required and requested by the Enforcing Party at the Enforcing Party's expense in connection with such enforcement IP Action;  provided, that the Non-Enforcing Party shall have the right to engage, at its cost and expense, independent counsel of its choice to advise such Non-Enforcing Party in connection with such assistance to the Enforcing Party.   (ii) The Non-Enforcing Party shall cooperate with, and provide reasonable assistance to, the Enforcing Party (and its designees) in connection with any IP Action brought by the Enforcing Party (or its designee) hereunder to the extent relating to the Licensed SpinCo IP, as may be reasonably requested by the Enforcing Party, including by providing access to relevant documents and other evidence (provided that the Parties shall enter into a joint defense agreement with respect to the common interest privilege protecting such communications in a form reasonably acceptable to the Parties) and making its employees available, subject to the other Party's reimbursement of any costs and expenses incurred by the Non-Enforcing Party in providing such assistance. The Enforcing Party shall keep the Non-Enforcing Party reasonably informed of any determinations or significant developments in any IP Action initiated by it pursuant to this Section 3.6 and, if the Non-Enforcing Party is SpinCo, then the Parent shall reasonably consult with the SpinCo and take into consideration input provided to Parent by SpinCo to the extent reasonable and provided in a timely manner.   (c) Allocation of Costs and Recoveries. Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties, (i) the costs and expenses relating to any enforcement IP Action commenced pursuant to this Section 3.6 shall be borne by the Enforcing Party; and (ii) any settlement payments or\n\n  -11-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  damages or other monetary awards (\"Recoveries\") recovered in any IP Action by the Enforcing Party, itself or through its designee, pursuant to this Section 3.6, whether by judgment or settlement, shall be allocated in the following order: (A) to reimburse the Enforcing Party for any costs and expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Enforcing Party and/or its designee(s) with respect to such IP Action, (B) to reimburse the Non-Enforcing Party for any costs and expenses incurred by such Party with respect to such IP Action to the extent the Non-Enforcing Party participated in an IP Action pursuant to this  Section 3.6 (and has not already been reimbursed by the Enforcing Party), including if it joins such IP Action (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the cost of any counsel employed by the Non-Enforcing Party), and (C) the remainder shall be allocated to the Enforcing Party.   (d) Settlement of Enforcement IP Action. The Enforcing Party shall not settle, or enter into a voluntary consent judgment with respect to, any enforcement IP Action under this Section 3.6 in a manner that would include any admissions of invalidity or unenforceability against the Non-Enforcing Party, or wrongdoing by the Non-Enforcing Party or any of its Group, or imposes any liability or payment or other obligation on the Non-Enforcing Party or any of its Group, without the Non-Enforcing Party's written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and in any event, without notifying the Non-Enforcing Party of any such proposed settlement or voluntary consent judgment. For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the foregoing, as between the Parties, the Enforcing Party shall have the sole and exclusive right to settle, or enter into a voluntary consent judgment with respect to, any enforcement IP Action under this Section 3.6. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not settle or enter into a voluntary consent judgment or enter into any other agreement that shall in any way impair the rights of SpinCo with respect to its Intellectual Property outside the Parent Field without SpinCo's consent, which may be withheld in its sole option.   3.7 Bankruptcy. In the event that this Agreement is terminated or rejected by SpinCo, a member of the SpinCo Group or its receiver or trustee under applicable bankruptcy laws due to such Party's bankruptcy, then all rights and licenses granted under or pursuant to this Agreement by SpinCo to Parent are, and shall otherwise be deemed to be, for purposes of Section 365(n) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the \"Code\") and any similar laws in any other country, licenses of rights to \"intellectual property\" as defined under the Code for purposes of Section 365(n). The Parties agree that all intellectual property rights licensed hereunder, including, without limitation, any patents or patent applications in any country of SpinCo or a member of SpinCo Group covered by the license grants under this Agreement, are part of the \"intellectual property\" as defined under the Code for purposes of Section 365(n) subject to the protections afforded the non-terminating Party under Section 365(n) of the Code, and any similar law or regulation in any other country.   3.8 Trademark Disclaimer. Neither Parent nor SpinCo nor any member of the Parent Group or SpinCo Group grants any right or license to the other to use any Parent Name or Parent Mark or SpinCo Name or SpinCo Mark in any manner including, without limitation, use in commerce as a trade name, trademark or other designation of origin. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood that signage, letterhead, invoices, business cards, promotional materials and similar items may reference the Parent Name or Parent Mark \"MeadWestvaco\" and \"MWV\" in the same manner as used by SpinCo prior to the Effective Time, during a twelve-month phase out period as SpinCo replaces such Parent Name and Parent Mark with the SpinCo Name and SpinCo Mark.\n\n  -12-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  4.

(i) To the extent that any Tangible/Intangible Information of SpinCo is in the possession of Parent, is comingled, and separation is not commercially reasonable, Parent will make such Tangible/Intangible Information available to SpinCo to separate at its own expense. If SpinCo chooses to separate such Tangible/Intangible Information, then Parent will deliver possession to SpinCo of any such separated Tangible/Intangible Information within one (1) month after such separation, without retaining any copies.   (ii) To the extent that any Tangible/Intangible Information of Parent is in the possession of SpinCo, is comingled, and separation is not commercially reasonable, SpinCo shall, at its option, (x) separate such comingled Tangible/Intangible Information at its own expense and deliver possession to Parent of any such separated Tangible/Intangible Information by the Delivery Date, without retaining any copies or (y) deliver possession of all of such comingled Tangible/Intangible Information to Parent by the Delivery Date, without retaining any copies.

The Party providing Information pursuant to this Section 5.1(b) shall only be obligated to provide such Information in the form, condition and format in which it then exists, and in no event shall such Party be required to perform any improvement, modification, conversion, updating or reformatting of any such Information, and nothing in this Section 5.1 shall expand the obligations of a Party under Section 5.4.   5.2 Ownership of Information. The provision of any Information pursuant to Section 5.1 shall not affect the ownership of such Information (which shall be determined solely in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Separation Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements), or constitute a grant of rights in or to any such Information (such grant of rights, to the extent they exist, are expressly addressed elsewhere in this Agreement). For the avoidance of doubt, no Party shall be required to provide to the other Party any updates, improvements, or additions to any Intellectual Property that it owns after the Effective Time.   5.3 Compensation for Providing Information.

TERM OF AGREEMENT\n\n                  1.1 The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and terminate upon the conclusion of the week following the conclusion of the Dolphins 2000 regular season or post season, if applicable (the \"Term\" or \"Initial Term\"). However, this Agreement may be earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions hereof.\n\n                  1.2 Hydron shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Dolphins at any time between November 1, 1997 and December 15, 1997, in which event this Agreement shall be terminated following the Dolphins last 1997 regular or post-season game, if any. If Hydron does not timely exercise its right to terminate this Agreement, then Hydron agrees that this Agreement shall continue for the entire four (4) year term unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 8 of this Agreement.\n\n         2.       SPONSORSHIP RIGHTS\n\n                  2.1 For the Term of this Agreement, the Dolphins will provide Hydron with certain advertising and promotional benefits as are set forth in and in accordance with Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto and made a part hereof (the \"Sponsorship Rights\").\n\n                  2.2 For the Term of this Agreement, Hydron shall be designated as a sponsor of the Dolphins in the Sunscreen/Skin Care Category (as defined below) and a licensee of the Marks (as defined below) in the Sunscreen/Skin Category by the Dolphins. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"Sunscreen/Skin Care Category\" means the product category consisting of sunscreen, sun protection and similar skin care products.\n\n                  2.3 The Sponsorship Rights granted by the Dolphins to Hydron are subject to\n\ntermination in whole or in part at any time upon written notice to Hydron if such Sponsorship Rights conflict with any exclusive advertising rights granted by NFL Properties, Inc. to one of its advertisers or sponsors. In the event of any such termination of exclusivity, the non-terminated Sponsorship Rights granted to Hydron by the Dolphins shall nonetheless continue for the remainder of the Term and the provisions of Section 8.2 shall apply. As of the date hereof, the Dolphins have no knowledge of any claim by NFL Properties that the Sponsorship Rights violate or conflict with exclusive rights granted by NFL Properties.\n\n         3.       CONSIDERATION\n\n                  3.1 In consideration of the Sponsorship Rights granted to Hydron hereunder:\n\n                            (a) Hydron shall pay to the Dolphins an aggregate amount of $96,000 (plus any applicable sales and other taxes) as follows: Hydron shall pay Dolphins the sum of $24,000 (plus any applicable sales and other taxes) on July 1, 1997, July 1, 1998, July 1, 1999 and July 1, 2000.\n\n                  3.2 In the event that the consideration is not paid by Hydron on or before the applicable payment due date, said failure to pay shall be considered a material breach by Hydron, and the Dolphins may elect to charge Hydron a late fee of 1.5% per month of the payment then due and owing until it is paid in full. The Dolphins agree to provide written notice to Hydron of the failure to receive any payment, and Hydron shall have a five (5) business day period following delivery of written notice in which to cure the payment default before the Dolphins may elect to terminate this Agreement and pursue applicable remedies. It is agreed by Hydron that any such election of remedies does not waive any other remedies for breach of contract available to the Dolphins.\n\n                  3.3 Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, including Exhibit \"A\", each of the parties shall pay its own expenses of performing its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n         4.       USE OF MARKS\n\n                  4.1 Hydron and the Dolphins may use the name, logos, colors, trademarks, service marks, or other identifying features (\"Marks\") of the other, as specifically contemplated in connection with the Sponsorship Rights, subject to any limitations set forth in this Agreement.\n\n                  4.2 All advertising material and any use of the other parties' Marks by a party is subject to the prior written approval of the Mark owner. Either party shall submit all such materials or proposed usage of a Mark to the other party at least two weeks prior to its intended use. The Mark owner shall have the right to inspect and require changes or deletions (including the right to disapprove of such advertisement or use of Marks in their entirety) of advertising and promotional copy or material that the Mark owner may deem to be contrary to its policies or best interests. Such requirements will not be unreasonably imposed, and the foregoing approvals and\n\n                                        2\n\nrequirements will be consistently given and imposed on all sponsors or users of the Marks, as the case may be.\n\n                  4.3 Any and all public announcements or press releases by or on behalf of the other party regarding the Sponsorship Rights or the details of this Agreement shall be subject to the consent of the other party, and each party shall have the right to approve in advance the contents and timing thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Dolphins acknowledge that Hydron, as a publicly held company, has disclosure obligations pursuant to the federal securities laws. Hydron agrees to take the comments of the Dolphins into account in preparing and disseminating such disclosure, but notwithstanding comments from the Dolphins, Hydron shall make such disclosure as may be required by law.\n\n                  4.4 For purposes of this Agreement, the Dolphins and Hydron expressly recognize that the Marks are the unique, valid and exclusive property of the respective owner of the Mark. The Dolphins and Hydron agree that they shall not, either during the term of this Agreement or thereafter, directly or indirectly, contest the validity of the other's Marks or any of the registrations pertaining thereto, in the United States or elsewhere, nor adopt the other's Marks or any term, word, mark or designation which is in any aspect confusingly similar to the other's Marks. The Dolphins and Hydron specifically acknowledges that any use of the Marks pursuant to this Agreement shall not create for the Dolphins or Hydron any right, title or interest in the other's Marks.

Upon termination of this Agreement, the Dolphins and Hydron shall immediately terminate all use of the other's Marks.\n\n                  4.5 Hydron expressly recognizes that the Dolphins have previously granted the exclusive rights to license and sublicense its Marks to NFL Properties, Inc., and that the grant to Hydron of the right to use the Marks is subject to the prior approval of NFL Properties, Inc. In the event that such approval is not so given by NFL Properties, Inc., then such usage rights of Hydron shall immediately terminate.

The Dolphins shall advise Hydron of any changes therein which may materially and adversely affect the Sponsorship Rights. As of the date hereof, the Dolphins have no knowledge of any claim by the NFL that the Sponsorship Rights violate any Governing League Rules.\n\n                  5.3 Without limiting any other potential uses of the Dolphins' Marks, Hydron agrees that the Dolphins may allow or authorize any League Sponsor (as defined below) to engage in advertising and promotional activities in the Dolphins' local market (including, without limitation, the Stadium), or\n\n\n\n\n\notherwise provide benefits to such League Sponsor, if such League Sponsor is entitled to engage in such activities or receive such benefits pursuant to any sponsorship or promotional licensing arrangement now or hereafter entered into between such League Sponsor and the NFL or any of its affiliates (including, without limitation, NFL Properties, Inc., NFL Enterprises, Inc. and NFL Films, Inc.). For purposes of this Agreement the term, \"League Sponsor\" shall mean any person or entity which currently is, or at any time becomes a sponsor or promotional licensee of or with respect to any NFL event or program now or hereafter in existence. By way of illustration only and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, League Sponsors may place advertising and promotional materials (including displays) in the Stadium, in connection with a League event, such as the Super Bowl.\n\n                  5.4 If any rule or regulation of the Stadium, or any Governing League Policy as described in Sections 5.1, 5.2 or 5.3 requires the termination or revision of any Sponsorship Right, such Sponsorship Right shall be revised or terminated upon written notice to Hydron and the provisions of Section 8.2 shall apply to such termination or revisions.\n\n         6.

Documentation (which shall include electronic correspondence) not defined as \"marketing pieces,\" which shall include, but is not limited to, correspondence and materials provided directly in response to due diligence requests, shall be principally reviewed and approved by S2K.

Web pages and other marketing pieces over 30 pages require a more in-depth review; therefore, Distributor cannot guarantee a one business day review for these items. c) The marketing piece must be submitted via Distributor's AdLit system by no later than 3:00 P.M. Mountain Time (2:00 P.M. PT/5:00 P.M. ET) on a business day in order to ensure that the Distributor has a full one business day to review and provide S2K with comments within such one business day timeframe. d) S2K must check the box on the AdLit coversheet whereby S2K requests and accepts the terms and fee(s) associated with expedited review in order to ensure that Distributor is notified of the expedited request. e) Distributor cannot guarantee that a marketing piece will be APPROVED within one business day of being received via AdLit.

S2K shall devote sufficient staff and expenditures to the performance of its services as shall be consistent with industry standards for the marketing of shares of the Fund. S2K shall perform these services in a professional and competent manner and shall provide such office space and equipment, telephone facilities and personnel as it determines may be reasonably necessary or beneficial in order to provide such services at no cost to the Distributor. 4. Duration and Termination. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall end on the 60th day following a written notice from one party to the other of its decision to terminate this Agreement at the end of such 60-day period or upon termination of the applicable Distribution Agreement with respect to a Fund. Termination of this Agreement as to a Fund shall not terminate this Agreement with respect to any other Fund so long as such other Fund's (or Funds', as the case may be) Distribution Agreement is effective.

(a) Indemnification of Agent by the Transaction Entities. Each of the Transaction Entities will, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless the Agent, its partners, members, directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates and each person, if any, who controls the Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act (each, an \"Indemnified Party\"), against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Indemnified Party may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act, other Federal or state statutory law or regulation or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any part of any Registration Statement at any time, any Statutory Prospectus as of any time, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending against any loss, claim, damage, liability, action, litigation, investigation or proceeding whatsoever (whether or not such Indemnified Party is a party thereto), whether threatened or commenced, and in connection with the enforcement of this provision with respect to any of the above as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that neither of the Transaction Entities will be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Agent specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that such information furnished by the Agent consists only of the information described as such in  Section 8(b) below.   (b) Indemnification of Company, Directors and Officers. The Agent will indemnify and hold harmless each of the Transaction Entities, their directors and each of their officers who signs a Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls either of the Transaction Entities within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act (each, an \"Agent Indemnified Party\"), against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which such Agent Indemnified Party may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act, other Federal or state statutory law or regulation or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any part of any Registration Statement at any time, any Statutory Prospectus as of any time, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to either of the Transaction Entities by the Agent specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Agent Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending against any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action, litigation, investigation or proceeding whatsoever (whether or not such Agent Indemnified Party is a party thereto), whether threatened or commenced, based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by the Agent consists of the following information in the Prospectus furnished on behalf of the Agent: the thirteenth full paragraph under the caption \"Plan of Distribution\" in the Final Prospectus Supplement and under the caption \"Other Relationships,\" in each case, only to the extent that such statements relate only to the Agent.\n\n  39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (c) Actions against Parties; Notification. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action against such indemnified party, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsections (a), (b) or (c) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under subsections (a), (b) or (c) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided further that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under subsections (a), (b) or (c) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8(c) for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; (iii) the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of an indemnified party.   (d) Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsections (a), (b) or (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsections (a), (b) or (c) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Transaction Entities on the one hand and by the Agent on the other hand from the offering of the Offered Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Agent, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Transaction Entities on the one hand and by the Agent on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Agent. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Agent and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this Section 8(d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), the Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the  Series A Preferred Stock sold pursuant to this Agreement exceeds the amount of any damages which the Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.\n\n  40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  9. Termination of Agency. If the Offered Shares are not sold by May 26, 2016, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of the Company and the Agent, except as provided in Section 10 hereof. As used in this Agreement, the term \"Agent\" includes any person substituted for the Agent under this Section 9.   10. Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Transaction Entities, the Manager or their respective officers and of the Agent set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of the Agent, the Transaction Entities, the Manager or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Offered Shares. If the settlement of the Offered Shares by the Agent is not consummated for any reason other than solely because of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company will reimburse the Agent for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the placement of the Offered Shares, and the respective obligations of the Transaction Entities and the Manager, on the one hand, and the Agent, on the other hand, pursuant to Section 8 hereof shall remain in effect. In addition, if the Offered Shares have been settled pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the representations and warranties in Sections 2 through 3 and all obligations under Section 5 shall also remain in effect.\n\n  41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  11. Notices. All communications hereunder will be in writing and, if sent to the Agent, will be mailed or delivered and confirmed to the Agent, with a copy to Bass, Berry & Sims PLC, 150 Third Avenue South, Suite 2800, Nashville, TN 37201, Attention: Lori B.

Absence of Fiduciary Relationship. The Transaction Entities and the Manager each acknowledge and agree that:   (a) No Other Relationship. The Agent has been retained solely to act as a placement agent in connection with the sale of Offered Shares and that no fiduciary, advisory or agency relationship between the Transaction Entities and the Manager on the one hand, and the Agent on the other has been created in respect of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Prospectus, irrespective of whether the Agent has advised or is advising either of the Transaction Entities or the Manager on other matters;   (b) Arms' Length Negotiations. The price of the Offered Shares set forth in this Agreement was established by the Company following discussions and arms' length negotiations with the Agent, and the Transaction Entities and Manager are capable of evaluating and understanding and understands and accepts the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;\n\n  42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (c) Absence of Obligation to Disclose. The Transaction Entities and the Manager have been advised that the Agent and its affiliates are engaged in a broad range of transactions which may involve interests that differ from those of the Transaction Entities and the Manager, and that the Agent has no obligation to disclose such interests and transactions to Transaction Entities and the Manager by virtue of any fiduciary, advisory or agency relationship; and   (d) Waiver. Each of the Transaction Entities and the Manager waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims they may have against the Agent for breach of fiduciary duty or alleged breach of fiduciary duty and agree that the Agent shall have no liability (whether direct or indirect) to either of the Transaction Entities or the Manager in respect of such a fiduciary duty claim or to any person asserting a fiduciary duty claim on behalf of or in right of the Transaction Entities or the Manager, including stockholders, holders of membership interests, employees or creditors of the Transaction Entities or the Manager.   17. Trial by Jury. Each of the Transaction Entities and the Manager (on its behalf and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, on behalf of its stockholders and affiliates) and the Agent hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.   18. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.   19. Jurisdiction. Each of the Transaction Entities and the Manager hereby submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in The City of New York in any suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Transaction Entities and the Manager irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in Federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in The City of New York and irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such suit or proceeding in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.   20. Termination. Until the Settlement Date, this Agreement may be terminated by the Agent by giving notice (in the manner prescribed by Section 9 hereof) to the Company, if (i) the Company shall have failed, refused or been unable, at or prior to the Settlement Date, to perform any agreement on its part to be performed hereunder unless the failure to perform any agreement is due to the default or omission by the Agent; (ii) any other condition of the obligations of the Agent hereunder is not fulfilled; (iii) trading in securities generally on the NYSE, NYSE MKT, or Nasdaq shall have been suspended or minimum or maximum prices shall have been established on either of such exchanges or such market by the Commission or by such exchange or other regulatory body or governmental authority having jurisdiction; (iv) trading or quotation in any of the Company's securities shall have been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or by the NYSE MKT, NYSE or Nasdaq or other regulatory body of governmental authority having jurisdiction; (v) a general banking moratorium has been declared by Federal or New York authorities; (vi) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred; (vii) there shall have been any material adverse change in general economic, political or financial conditions in the United States or in international conditions on the financial markets in the United States, in each case, the effect of which is such as to make it, in the Agent's reasonable judgment, inadvisable to proceed with the delivery of the Securities; or (viii) any attack on, outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration of war or act of terrorism involving the United States or any other national or international calamity or emergency has occurred if, in the Agent's reasonable judgment, the effect of any such attack, outbreak, escalation, declaration, act, calamity or emergency makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the completion of the placement or the delivery of the Securities. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 21 shall be without liability on the part of the Company or the Agent, except as otherwise provided in Sections 5(a), 7, 8 and 9 hereof.\n\n  43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  If the foregoing is in accordance with the Agent's understanding of our agreement, kindly sign and return to the Company one of the counterparts hereof, whereupon it will become a binding agreement among the Transaction Entities, the Manager and the Agent in accordance with its terms.

If Company becomes dissatisfied with any of Contractor's personnel providing the Services, Company may notify Contractor of the details of its dissatisfaction, and the parties shall cooperate to remedy the problem as soon as possible.

(d) Company may request changes that affect the scope or duration of the Services relating to any Statement of Work, including changes in the Specifications and changes in the deliverables to be delivered. Company acknowledges that any change in Specifications may result in changes to estimated fees and estimated timeline for creation of deliverables. Company also may request a change in the Schedule without changing the scope of the Services relating to the applicable Statement of Work. In either case, the parties shall negotiate in good faith a reasonable and equitable adjustment in the applicable fees, Schedule and Specifications. Contractor shall continue work pursuant to the existing Statement of Work, and shall not be bound by any change requested by Company, until such change has been accepted in writing by Contractor. (e) The obligations of Company in connection with a particular engagement shall be set forth in the applicable Statement of Work. Company agrees to perform such obligations in accordance with, and subject to, such Statement of Work. Company acknowledges that when a Statement of Work provides that Company's personnel are to work with Contractor's personnel in connection with an engagement, Company's failure to assign Company personnel having skills commensurate with their role with respect to such engagement could adversely affect Contractor's ability to provide the Services.\n\nPage 3 of 10\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) To the extent Contractor provides any third party materials and products Contractor acknowledges that it shall be solely responsible for ensuring the functionality and specifications of such third party materials and products used in performing Services under this Agreement. 2.

(d) Consultant agrees that after Company pays Contractor in full, or after the termination of this agreement, Company may make any changes or additions to the software Consultant created for Company under this Agreement, which Company in Company's discretion may consider necessary, and Company may engage others to make any such changes or additions, without further payments to Consultant. 5.

If King is interested in obtaining the Metformin Product Rights, it shall so notify Depomed in writing prior to the expiration of the Evaluation Period, and upon Depomed's receipt of such notice King and Depomed shall promptly commence good-faith negotiations, for a period of 30 days and such longer period as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties in writing in the event the parties have made material progress in the negotiations (the \"Negotiation Period\"), regarding the commercially reasonable terms of an agreement pursuant to which King shall obtain the Metformin Product Rights. If Depomed and King fail to enter into an agreement for the Metformin Product Rights prior to the expiration of the Negotiation Period, then Depomed shall thereafter have the right to negotiate and enter into an agreement with a Third Party granting the Metformin Product Rights to a Third Party; provided that, for a period of 6 months, any such agreement may not be on terms and conditions materially more favorable to the Third Party than the terms and conditions last offered by King prior to the termination of discussions with Depomed.
