IBM shall             advise MSL [*] Days in advance of the scope and method by which             such audits are to be conducted. MSL will be given the opportunity             to comment upon these procedures prior to the audit taking place.             For all identified IBM specifications, MSL will maintain and             produce for IBM process documentation for use in all audits             performed by IBM and will have current copies of said documentation             available prior to the start of an audit.\n\n      b)    Upon completion of all audits performed, IBM will provide written             documentation to MSL of the audit results in the form of an audit             report. MSL will be required to respond in writing to IBM on the             completion status of all actions and or requirements identified in             the audit report within [*] Days of receipt of the audit report.\n\nSECTION 8.0 PURCHASE OF ASSETS\n\n      a)    On the Effective Date, MSL shall purchase all tangible assets listed             in Attachment 3: Asset List, Part 1A and non-capitalized hand tools             used in the manufacture of Products for [*] U.S. dollars [*].             Within [*] days of the Effective Date, IBM shall give the tangible             assets listed in Attachment 3: Asset List, Part 1B to MSL. On the             Effective Date, MSL shall purchase\n\nPage 10                                  Dated 05/05/98\n\n                                IBM Confidential\n\n            the assets listed in Attachment 3: Asset List, Part 2 for the amount             stated on the bill of sale for such assets and pay for such assets             in full by or before December 1, 1998 (the \"Payment Date\").\n\n      b)    The Parties acknowledge that the assets listed in Attachment 3:             Asset List, are a pro forma listing only and that within 10 (ten)             days of the Effective Date, both parties agree to perform a physical             audit of these assets listed and in IBM's possession as of the             Effective date to ascertain that the assets located during that             physical audit are verified. Within 20 (twenty) days after the             Effective Date, IBM will prepare a listing of the assets in             Attachment 3: Asset List, Part 1B to verify IBM's net book value of             the assets plus [*] for each non-capitalized printer. This listing             shall contain the price for each asset listed separately. MSL shall             notify IBM within 30 (thirty) days of the Effective Date if it does             not wish to receive all of the available tangible assets in             Attachment 3: Asset List, Part 1B by notifying IBM in writing of the             types of equipment it does not wish to receive. IBM shall choose             which equipment MSL will receive based on MSL's chosen equipment             type. The startup and investment expense defined in Attachment 4,             Section 3, shall be reduced by IBM's net book value of the assets in             Part 1B for the equipment accepted by MSL plus [*] U.S. dollars             [*] for each non-capitalized printer. In any event, the physical             audit for all assets shall result in a new listing for the assets             contemplated hereunder which listing shall be substituted for the             Attachment 3: Asset List that is attached to this Agreement at the             Effective Date. The amount stated on the bill of sale of the assets             listed in Part 2 shall reflect the results of a physical audit and             obsolescence review. Such adjustments shall be subject to the             mutual agreement of the Parties.\n\n      c)    If by the Payment Date, MSL fails to pay IBM in full for the assets             listed in Attachment 3: Asset List, Part 2 at the price specified in             b) above, IBM may offset the balance owed by MSL as provided in             Section 6.2(a) above, and without MSL's further consent, until IBM             has recovered such balance.\n\n      d)    MSL acknowledges that IBM has not made any representations or             warranties with respect to the assets listed in Attachment 3: Asset             List, except those expressly set forth in this Agreement, including,             but not limited to the representation and warranty of title. All             assets delivered to MSL pursuant to this section shall be provided             on an 'AS IS' basis. NO OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESSED OR             IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THE WARRANTY OF             NON-INFRINGMENT ARE PROVIDED HEREUNDER.\n\n      e)    In the event of termination or expiration of this Agreement             pursuant to Section 5.0 above, IBM shall have an option, which             shall expire [*] days after such termination or expiration, to             purchase from MSL, at a reasonable price agreeable to the Parties,             all assets used by MSL to perform the manufacturing and fulfillment             functions\n\nPage 11\n\n\n\n\n\n                                 Dated 05/05/98\n\n                                IBM Confidential\n\n            outlined in Attachment 1: Statement of Work, to the extent owned or             transferable by MSL, and required by IBM to perform such functions.\n\n      f)    Assets purchased by MSL and listed in Attachment 3: Asset List, Part             2 are to be used solely in Products purchased by IBM pursuant to the             Attachment 1: Statement of Work.\n\nSECTION 9.0 PERSONNEL\n\n      a)    Attachment 2 contains a list of the individuals employed by IBM at             the date hereof in connection with this Agreement, including active             employees and employees who are on leave of absence or sick leave             (herein the \"Employees\").\n\n      b)    MSL will make an unconditional employment offer to the Employees,             listed in Attachment 2, to be effective on the Effective Date of             this Agreement. The Employees who accept employment offers from             MSL and who have begun their employment with MSL (\"Transferred             Employees\") will be employed by MSL in accordance with the terms set             forth below. IBM will terminate all Employees, listed in Attachment             2, at the Effective Date of this Agreement and IBM will be             responsible for any and all employment related liabilities up to the             Effective Date, including, but not limited to, vacation and sick             time, workers compensation claims, variable compensation, and             severance.\n\n      c)    MSL agrees that all Transferred Employees will be continuously             employed by MSL for at least [*] after the Effective Date, except as             otherwise provided herein, and will receive a total compensation             package as identified in Attachment 2: Employee list and Benefits             Information. Furthermore, with respect to the Transferred Employees,             MSL shall grant, to the extent granted by IBM, credit for service             with IBM prior to the Effective Date for purposes of participation             and eligibility to participate under MSL's employee benefit plans             and other policies and programs of MSL.\n\n      d)    Nothing in this Agreement shall operate in any way to limit or             prevent MSL from terminating any Transferred Employee at any time             for reasons of cause related to poor job performance or conditions             of employment.\n\n      e)    If MSL suffers a substantially adverse change in its business,             related to a reduction in IBM's Products requirements, including             reductions of Products requirements due to migration to a             competitive supplier, for the [*] from the Effective Date of this             Agreement, MSL may terminate such number of Transferred Employees             as it deems necessary. However, IBM shall only reimburse MSL for             termination benefits paid to such Transferred Employees, which are             substantially similar to IBM's then severance package, and             provided that all MSL subcontractors and other MSL non management             employees assigned to the US Work Center have been terminated             prior to or along with the termination of the Transferred             Employees.\n\nPage 12                                  Dated 05/05/98\n\n                                IBM Confidential\n\n      f)    IBM agrees that, for a period of [*] years from the Effective Date             of this Agreement, it will not in any way solicit for employment             any Transferred Employees without the prior written consent of MSL;             provided, however, that the foregoing will not restrict or prevent             IBM from a) employing any such person who contacts IBM on his or her             own initiative without any solicitation or encouragement from IBM             or b) by using general employment advertising or communications or             independent search firms, hiring any person who responds thereto,             provided that IBM does not direct or encourage such independent             search firms to solicit such Transferred Employees.\n\nSECTION 10.0 LEASE OF PREMISES\n\n      The Lease of Premises Agreement is a separate agreement governing the       lease of certain IBM buildings to MSL, the execution of which is a       condition precedent to the effectiveness of this Agreement.\n\nSECTION 11.0 MANUFACTURING, FULFILLMENT, AND INTEGRATION\n\n      Attachment 1 is the Statement of Work that outlines the manufacturing,       fulfillment, and Integration requirements and responsibilities of both       parties.\n\nSECTION 12.0 TRANSITION SERVICES\n\n\n\n\n\n      Supplement 1 to the Statement of Work identifies the Transition Services       that the Parties are to perform in accordance with the prices set forth       therein and starting on the Effective Date of the Agreement.

MSL       shall not use any proprietary processes for the assembly, subassembly and       final tests, and quality testing of the Products subject to this Agreement       unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties in writing.\n\n13.2  Confidential Information and Advertising\n\nPage 13                                  Dated 05/05/98\n\n                                IBM Confidential\n\n      a)    IBM shall not receive confidential information from MSL under this             Agreement. However, if it becomes necessary for IBM to give certain             confidential information to MSL, it will be done so pursuant to the             Agreement for Exchange of Confidential Information (\"AECI\") Number             4998S60076.\n\n      b)    All information considered confidential by IBM will be marked             confidential by IBM prior to the exchange. If the confidential             information is to be disclosed orally, IBM will promptly provide MSL             with a written summary following the disclosure. In the event, the             information is not marked confidential, it shall not be deemed             confidential.\n\n      c)    Each time IBM wishes to disclose specific information to MSL, IBM             will issue a supplement to the above referenced AECI. All requests             to disclose confidential information must be approved by the             Relationship Managers. During the term of this Agreement and upon             the request of IBM, MSL shall return all confidential information             immediately.\n\n      d)    Neither Party shall disclose the terms of this Agreement to any             third Party, including debt or financing institutions, without the             prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be             unreasonably withheld or delayed, except as required by law. Each             Party shall provide the other with prior written notice of any such             required disclosure.\n\n      e)    Neither Party shall make any public announcements regarding this             Agreement or matters pertaining hereto, other than as may be             expressly agreed upon in advance by the Parties in writing.\n\n13.3  Licenses\n\n      a)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing             in this Agreement grants or may grant MSL any rights or licenses in             any preexisting intellectual property of IBM except that IBM grants             MSL a royalty-free license to use the confidential information             disclosed in connection with this Agreement under the AECI             referenced in 13.2 necessary to manufacture Products solely for IBM.

MSL will provide IBM Strategic Parts and       IBM Designated Parts as follows:\n\n      a)    IBM procurement may sell IBM Strategic Parts to MSL by specifying             price, lead time and other terms with mutually agreed to ordering             processes such as;\n\n            i)    MSL may order IBM Strategic Parts from IBM procurement through                   standard purchase orders, and/or\n\n            ii)   MSL may issue periodic blanket purchase orders to IBM                   procurement for lineside stocking and pull logistics                   requirements for IBM Strategic Parts.\n\n      b)    MSL may purchase IBM Designated Parts through IBM nominated             suppliers, as agreed to by IBM. IBM will disclose, as confidential             to MSL, terms and conditions contained in the subject IBM nominated             supplier/IBM contract, which IBM determines are relevant to MSL's             performance under the Agreement. MSL shall be responsible for all             liabilities to IBM nominated suppliers for IBM Designated Parts             ordered by MSL. If an IBM nominated supplier objects, MSL shall             immediately inform IBM. IBM agrees to provide reasonable assistance             to MSL in resolving the situation. If such IBM nominated supplier             refuses to [*] to MSL at IBM's [*], IBM cannot use [*] from such             supplier to determine MSL [*] described in Section 7.5 e) i) above,             and upon written notice to IBM, MSL will be entitled to increase             the [*] of the [*] to\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 16 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n            reflect MSL's actual increase in IBM [*].

However, if a specific price reduction is the direct result             of a previously IBM approved substantial engineering, design, or             resourcing change by MSL, that price reduction will be [*] for a             period of [*] months, then [*]% of the Parts price reduction will             be [*] to IBM.\n\nSECTION 9.0 PREMIUM COST\n\n      Premium costs may be incurred in order to meet Delivery Dates.\n\n      a)    MSL may submit premium costs to IBM for reimbursement that are in             addition to prices defined in Sections 7.1, and 7.2. Premium costs             include materials, labor and other extraordinary items.\n\n      b)    The Parties agree that [*] of all Parts price reductions will be [*]             to IBM when MSL begins using and shipping the lower costs Parts.             However, if a specific price reduction is the direct result of a             previously IBM approved substantial engineering, design, or             resourcing change by MSL, that price reduction will be [*] for a             period of [*] months, then [*] of the Parts price reduction will be             [*] to IBM.\n\n      b)    If Requirements Accuracy, as defined in Appendix 2, exceeds [*]%             and if demand is beyond Supply Flexibility as defined in Section             13.2 and Appendix 4, premium costs resulting solely from unplanned\n\n\n\n\n\n            demand shall be subject to reimbursement.\n\n      c)    Total premium costs for any single event which are equal to or             exceed [*] must be pre-approved in writing by IBM prior to MSL             authorizing or expending the premium. Total premium costs for any             single event which are less than [*] may be incurred by MSL without             IBM authorization to later be negotiated with IBM in good faith.\n\n      d)    MSL will use the following process for requesting authorization             and/or reimbursement of premium costs from IBM:\n\n      e)    Premium Price\n\n            i)    Material\n\n                  MSL agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to purchase                   materials at the lowest possible cost within the lead times                   required or authorized by IBM. However, when materials are not                   available with IBM's lead times, premium cost for materials                   may apply. Premium cost for Parts is the [*] (which will not                   exceed MSL's actual cost paid to it's suppliers to be paid                   by IBM when the\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 17 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n                  Parts are required earlier than on the stated and mutually                   agreed upon lead time.

If IBM agrees that the resources are required, MSL and IBM                   will negotiate in good faith the price for such resources.\n\n                  MSL will report all open premium costs, which are subject to                   request for reimbursement by IBM as a part of monthly                   Measurements.\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 18 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\nSECTION 10.0 ORDER MANAGEMENT, DELIVERY, AND SHIPMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n10.1  Order Management\n\n      a)    IBM Customer Orders will be placed from IBM to MSL. MSL will fulfill             these orders according to the Performance Appendix 3 unless IBM             gives MSL specific written instruction otherwise. MSL will ship and             deliver these Products in accordance with the ship and delivery             dates stated on the order. In the case of Integration, shipments and             deliveries will be made in accordance to the customer roll out             schedules provided by IBM. MSL will conform to the stated lead times             agreed to and published by IBM to the Delivery Point as long as the             requested Delivery Date on the IBM Customer Order falls within MSL's             commitment to the forecast. Product lead times are published in the             Product Attachments.\n\n      b)    MSL will manage the applicable IBM Customer Order back logs. These             include but are not limited to AAS, EOSE, GEMS, IPRs, Q-Ship, MES             and others as defined by IBM. In conjunction with these IBM ordering             channels MSL will perform Order Desk responsibilities. MSL will             review all orders requesting delivery improvements, improving these             order to satisfy the customer required delivery dates given supply             continuity and available capacity. At [*] to IBM, MSL will accept             [*]. Deferments will be requested of MSL through the IBM ordering             systems mentioned above, or in writing from IBM. MSL will             reschedule the deferred orders to meet the requested ship dates.             In addition MSL will accept request to alter order content if Parts             and capacity are available. MSL will respond to all request to             improve, defer and/or alter orders in [*] Days. MSL agrees to             maintain the above mentioned IBM Customer Order backlogs keeping             these back logs up to date. MSL agrees to maintain local Order             Desk support in the geography specific Work Center.\n\n      c)    MSL agrees to perform materials requirement planning (\"MRP\") on top             level requirements input and acquire the appropriate Parts to             support Delivery Dates and IBM Customer Orders. This includes the             placing of purchase orders and/or IPRs on suppliers, some of which             may be IBM locations.\n\n      d)    Due to the high commonality of Parts in IBM's Products, MSL will             allow IBM to revise Product model mix as required. MSL will             acknowledge IBM's Product mix changes within [*] Days after receipt             of IBM's change notice.\n\n10.2  Schedule / On Time Delivery\n\n      a)    MSL will maintain [*] ([*]%) on time shipment. Specifically             Product(s) are to arrive in full at the Delivery Points on the             Delivery Date.\n\n      b)    MSL agrees to track and report on shipments/deliveries to IBM             customers per the IBM Customer Orders at the request of IBM.\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 19 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n10.3  Delivery\n\n      a)    Title and risk of loss to Products shall pass to IBM at the time of             shipment from the Delivery Point unless otherwise stated in Section             15.0.\n\n      b)    If Product shipments are made prior to the Delivery Date without             IBM's prior written approval, IBM may elect to delay passage of the             title until the Delivery Date. If the delivery is late then transfer             of Product title will be made on the later date. In addition MSL             will not deliver Products in quantities in excess of those set forth             in on the IBM Customer Order, without IBM's prior written approval.\n\n10.4  Delays in Shipment\n\n      MSL shall notify IBM immediately of any anticipated late deliveries and       any impending plant or facility shut downs for any reasons. If MSL fails       to ship Product to the Delivery Point on schedule for any reason other       than Force Majeure or delays caused substantially by IBM, MSL shall ship       Product to the Delivery Point by air or in the most expeditious manner       possible. After MSL delivers Product to the Delivery Point, MSL will ship       Product to the designation stated on the IBM Customer Order by air or in       the most expeditious manner possible. MSL will be responsible for any       additional premium costs associated with the late shipment of Product       not only to the [*] but also to the [*] stated on the IBM Customer       Order.\n\n10.5  Shipment Terms\n\n\n\n\n\n      a)    The prices set forth in Section 7.0 Product Price include MSL's out             of pocket costs for freight, duty, customs, clearance, and             appropriate insurance, and any other costs related to the shipment,             export, or import of the Products before delivery to IBM. The cost             are the responsibility of MSL. The method of transportation shall be             suitable surface or air transport to the Delivery Point, Customer             location, or point of entry sufficient to meet IBM's Delivery Date.             The Product Attachment(s) shall state the Delivery Points.\n\n      b)    MSL shall arrange shipment with IBM carriers that will deliver             product to the destination on the IBM Customer Order in time for the             product to arrive on the committed arrival date which is stated on             the Customer Order. MSL shall utilize IBM carriers for all outbound             shipments, unless prior written approval from IBM to do otherwise.             IBM's approval will not be unreasonably withheld. Contractual             conflict with IBM carriers, or added IBM cost are some, but not all,             reasonable causes for denial of IBM approval.\n\nSECTION 11.0 PRODUCT FORECAST\n\n11.1  MSL agrees to participate in the IBM supply and demand process adhering to       the IBM EMLS corporate calendar. MSL will utilize the EMLS regen and or       provide the input into EMLS to insure a successful supply and demand       interlock. The EMLS regen must include all part numbers consumed in the       Charlotte Work Center.\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 20 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n11.2  Each month IBM will provide MSL, one rolling [*] month forecast by machine       type, model, and by geography. This forecast will be MSL's authorization       to order/purchase Parts only for the fulfillment of orders, in accordance       to the IBM published lead-times for such materials. Products shall be       produced and delivered according to actual intake of IBM Customer Orders.       MSL will participate in the process of requirements planning by giving the       best Product supply projection and participating in cross functional       meetings when required.\n\n      The following will apply:\n\n      a)    The forecast will contain anticipated Delivery Dates for specified             quantities of machine types, models and geographies and lead-time             profile updates, as required, for specific Parts.\n\n      b)    MSL will notify IBM within [*] Days of receipt of a forecast if MSL             is unable to meet the quantities and Delivery Dates. If MSL fails to             notify IBM within the [*] Days, MSL will be deemed to have accepted             the quantities and Delivery Dates and will be bound by them;             provided, however, that MSL's actual or deemed acceptance of any             forecast shall be subject to the availability of IBM Parts and IBM             Designated Parts as needed, and MSL shall not be subject to any             penalties (and IBM shall not be able to reject any proposed             rescheduling of Delivery Dates) under this Agreement for failure to             meet Delivery Dates due to the unavailability of such Parts at the             times necessary to meet Delivery Dates, provided further however             that such unavailability of IBM Parts or IBM Designated Parts is not             due to MSL's failure to properly order such Parts or otherwise             properly manage its relationship with the provider of such Parts.\n\n      c)    If MSL notifies IBM that it cannot meet the quantities and Delivery             Dates in IBM's forecast, MSL's notification will include the             quantities MSL can deliver within the forecast's Delivery Dates and             proposed schedule of Delivery Dates for delivering the quantities             MSL cannot deliver within the forecast. IBM shall notify MSL in             writing, within [*] Days of receipt of MSL's notification, of its             decision either, in its sole discretion to:\n\n            i)    agree to the quantities and Delivery Dates in MSL's                   notification, which will then become binding upon both                   parties; or\n\n            ii)   agree to the quantities that will meet the forecast's Delivery                   Dates, which will then become binding on both parties, and                   either begin good faith negotiations with MSL to resolve any                   shortfall or reject MSL's proposed schedule for the remaining                   quantities; or provided, however that IBM may not reject MSL's                   proposed schedules if the reason for MSL's inability to meet                   the Delivery Dates is directly attributable to a breach of                   this Agreement by IBM. MSL may, with IBM's prior written                   approval and at MSL's expense, employ another manufacturer for                   the quantities that MSL cannot deliver within the forecast for                   the affected products. Notwithstanding any other term of this                   Agreement, if IBM rejects all or any part of MSL's proposal,                   IBM shall also be free to seek\n\n\n\n\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 21 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n                  another manufacturer (internally or externally) for the                   quantities MSL can not deliver within the forecast for the                   affected Products.\n\n            iii)  If good faith negotiations fail to resolve the shortfall                   within [*] Days, IBM shall have the option to reject MSL's                   whole proposal.\n\n      d)    The forecasts provided by IBM, or agreed to by IBM hereunder, do not             obligate IBM to purchase any Product.\n\n11.3  Feature Forecast\n\n      a)    MSL agrees to perform all feature forecasting as part of their             responsibilities. MSL agrees to forecast features in full support of             the requirements forecast that IBM passes at a machine type level             per Section 11.1 above.\n\n      b)    MSL will notify IBM within [*] Days of receipt of the monthly             requirements forecast, at the machine type level, if MSL is unable             to support the features necessary to meet the Delivery Dates of the             machine types per Section 11.1 above of this Agreement.\n\nSECTION 12.0 ENGINEERING CHANGE\n\n      a)    MSL is required to inform IBM of any necessary or required EC which             would be applicable to the Products in general. In no event shall             MSL make any changes or incorporate any modification to Products             without the prior written agreement of IBM.\n\n      b)    IBM may, at its option, propose ECs to the Products to be delivered,             in which event MSL will be notified in writing. MSL agrees that IBM             shall have the right to require the incorporation of such ECs and             MSL shall, within [*] Days of such notification, give to IBM a             written evaluation of EC stating the cost increase or cost decrease             to the Products. In addition, this evaluation should include, but is             not limited to, MSL's evaluation of the ECs effect on the inventory,             delivery schedules and impact effect on function, reliability and             performance of Products. If such evaluation cannot be completed             within such period, notice to this effect shall be given by MSL as             soon as MSL learns that such evaluation cannot be completed and in             no event later than the [*] Days following notification. MSL will             give IBM a future completion date and reason for delay in such             notice.\n\n      c)    Upon completion of MSL's evaluation, IBM and MSL agree that 1) MSL             will implement the EC after MSL has received IBM's consent in             writing to the mutually agreed upon cost and delivery schedule, 2)             MSL will provide additional information that IBM may reasonably             require to further evaluate the EC, or 3) IBM will cancel the             specific EC.\n\n      d)    ECs will be brought to the attention of MSL via Engineering Change             Notifications (ECNs), that may have various forms, and may come from             IBM or IBM designated parties. However, the ECN is not an             authorization to execute the change. Upon receipt of an ECN, MSL             will respond by quoting the cost of that EC to IBM. MSL will not             implement any EC without an explicit authorization from IBM to             implement it.

Appendix             5 contains requirements for EC process flow and EC cycle times.\n\n      e)    MSL will process ECs according to IBM rules and specific IBM             requirements, and will enter corresponding data in EC application             systems. MSL will need to have the capability to receive IBM             development released ECs in both the Charlotte Work Center and the             Valencia Work Center.\n\n      f)    EC administration cost are included in the prices as defined in             Section 7.0.\n\n\n\n\n\nSECTION 13.0 INVENTORY\n\n      a)    MSL is fully responsible for inventory ownership, excluding             consigned inventory, however MSL agrees to manage all inventories.             MSL will manage the material in the supply pipeline, as well as own             and manage work in process and finished goods until shipment of the             Product to the IBM Customer Order. On the Effective Date, MSL will             accept responsibility and liability for all open purchase orders and             IPRs for Parts, excluding Consigned Parts, which are required by             Products listed in the Product Attachments. MSL owns inventory,             excluding consignment, until title transfer at the time of shipment.             IBM will not be responsible for any associated carrying costs,             warehousing costs, excess and or scrap of MSL owned inventory. If             requested by IBM, MSL will subcontract to IBM the scrapping of Parts             owned by MSL. Actual costs charged to IBM by certified scrap             suppliers for the scrapping of Parts owned by MSL will be invoiced             by IBM to MSL.\n\n      b)    MSL will control all inventories in support of this Agreement per             IBM's guidelines concerning value classified parts, IBM Document             CP10.13.\n\n      c)    MSL will also be responsible for the data management necessary to             separate IBM consigned inventory from MSL inventory within the same             facility and systems.\n\n      d)    MSL will perform Rotating Inventory Audits and Counts (RIA/RIC) on             IBM consigned inventory in compliance to IBM's instructions.\n\n      e)    MSL and IBM will review inventory monthly, during this review MSL             will provide a written report that includes the items detailed under             Inventory in the Performance Appendix.\n\n      f)    MSL prices include charges for MSL inventory management and             ownership. Both parties agree that IBM has no liability for             inventories that MSL purchases for the purposes of this contract,             providing that forecast (requirements) accuracy is equal to or             greater than the level defined in Appendix 2. If Requirements             Accuracy falls below [*]% liabilities for any machine type for any             quarter, IBM will compensate MSL according to the method describe in             Appendix 2.\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 23 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n13.1  Consigned Products\n\n      a)    MSL acknowledges that it will manage inventory consigned to MSL by             IBM.

MSL will be responsible for maintaining the             necessary technical support to implement these processes and             identify problems in the integration process. Process deficiencies             will be brought to the attention of the IBM Integration program             manager staff for resolution. Deficiencies realized due to customer             provided items will be resolved directly with the customer through             the MSL account coordinator or by the technical staff, whichever is             appropriate.\n\n      c)    MSL will own the entire manufacturing and delivery process and be             the sole interface with the customer (IBM and/or end user) through             the account coordinators.\n\n14.5  Inventory Management\n\n      a)    Provide a secure environment for the management and control of             consigned Products. This area should be fenced, with limited access             and within a reasonable distance from the manufacturing area and the             receiving docks.\n\n      b)    An automated inventory management system must be used to track             receipts, disposition and balance on hand at any point in time.             Information required by IBM personnel performing project management             activities for customers will be provided on an 'as required' basis             and will be readily available to such personnel. This inventory must             be labeled (bar coded) and separated by customer.\n\n      c)    Physical inventory counts are to be performed as needed for all             consigned inventory, for each customer, counted at least every [*]             Days with a accuracy target of [*]. This target is based on the             delta between the actual inventory count and the inventory             management system. Discrepancies are to identified, root cause             analysis performed, results reported (quarterly) and corrective             actions initiated. MSL is responsible for the cost associated with             the replacement of IBM and/or IBM customer\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 26 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n            consigned Products which have been received by MSL and need to be             replaced as the result of theft or negligence.\n\n      d)    All consigned inventory is the responsibility of MSL until Delivery.\n\n14.6  Manufacturing\n\n      a)    The integration line should use a line control system that ties to             an automated ordering system that provides order accuracy, tracking,             disposition and history. The work environment should be kept             presentable and organized and available for customer tours.\n\n      b)    Incomplete shipments, with the customer approval, should use a             deviation process and be documented with the customer authorization.\n\n      c)    The manufacturing process must continue to use the line break in,             pilot and certification process currently in use unless mutually             agreed to in writing.\n\n14.7  On Site Repairs\n\n      a)    The consigned Product set may include both IBM and non-IBM Products,             new as well as used which may or may not be covered by a new product             warranty, IBM maintenance or another maintenance provider. In the             case of IBM logo Products, MSL will initiate repair of these             Products in the most cost effective and efficient manner. In the             case of repairs required to be performed by the third party             maintainers, MSL will provide a suitable work area for these repairs             and ensure that the necessary security requirements are met when             visited by non IBM personnel. When consigned Product defects are to             be returned to the manufacturer for either repair/replacement, MSL             will control this process.\n\n      b)    Out of box failures of RS Products will be replaced from inventory             or repaired as directed by IBM. These replacements are to be given             priority over new orders during times of product constraints.\n\n\n\n\n\n14.8  Packaging\n\n      Integrated machines may require unique packaging based on their       configuration and the individual customers requirement. MSL will design       these boxes in accordance with IBM design criteria to insure that they       provide maximum protection against in route damage. All shipping       containers must be labeled in accordance with the guidelines outlined in       the Section 16.0 Packaging and in addition to any unique labeling customer       requirements.\n\n14.9  Security\n\n      a)    Sufficient security must be provided for work in process items,             customer and MSL/IBM provided. In addition, secured spaces will be             required from time to time for individual customers depending on the             nature of the work. Currently there is a contractual requirement for             secured space to perform the US Postal Service, hard drive, code             load program.\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 27 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n      b)    All reasonable precautions must be exercised to prevent unauthorized             access, use, modification, tampering or theft of software and             hardware consigned to MSL for the execution of Integration. Also,             these precautions must prevent unauthorized access to a customer's             remote system used in the performance of Integration.\n\n14.10 Scheduling\n\n      Product orders placed on MSL by IBM, in most cases, the CRAD (Customer       Required Arrival Date) will tie to the Integration roll out delivery date.       In those cases where there is a difference, MSL will validate the correct       delivery date with the IBM project manager. If an improvement or deferral       is required in the Product build schedule and based on Product       availability, MSL will schedule the Product build to insure arrival by the       required CRAD.\n\n14.11 Delivery\n\n      MSL will maintain [*] percent ([*]%) on time delivery, measured against       the CRAD date in the integration roll out schedule. Due to the nature of       the integration orders, there is no [*] option, unless agreed to prior to       shipment by the IBM project manager and/or the customer.\n\n14.12 Customer Satisfaction\n\n      Customer satisfaction is the responsibility of MSL. IBM will measure the       customer satisfaction via surveys. MSL commits to a customer satisfaction       target of [*]. This will be a reflection of MSLs on time deliveries,       flexibility in meeting the customers unplanned requirements, the quality       of the services performed and MSL's relationship, in general with IBM's       customers. The customer set will include the IBM Global Services project       managers and IBM's customers.\n\n14.13 Integration Quality\n\n      The service being performed is to be of high quality and free from process       defects. The target objective will be [*]%, measured monthly. MSL will be       responsible for the repair and/or replacement of Parts and Products which       have been damaged during the performance of the Integration. MSL will be       responsible for cost incurred by IBM as a direct result of MSL's failure       to follow the Integration procedures subject to the limitations contained       in Section 15.3 of the Base Agreement.\n\n14.14 Price\n\n      a)    IBM will establish a list of those items which are standard             components of the Integration process. IBM and MSL will agree upon             an execution time and a price, as stated in Section 7.2 b), for each             standard item. Integration requirements outside of these standard             items will be individually determined. Once these prices for these             standard items are established they will remain in effect during             the entire term of this Agreement.\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 28 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n\n\n\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n      b)    MSL will be responsible to track items which are beyond the             individual Integration SOW being executed when performed at IBM's             request and provide sufficient documentation to support the price             along with IBM's authorization of the added cost. MSL will invoice             IBM weekly for these costs. In those cases when a specific request             becomes standard, or a change in effort is requested by a customer,             a revision to the Integration SOW will be made and the contracted             price between IBM and MSL will be updated.\n\n      c)    MSL will be responsible for any cost beyond the agreed to [*] if             these costs were within the control of MSL.\n\n14.15 Transportation\n\n      a)    Premium outbound transportation may be used when requested by a             customer. In these cases, MSL must provide sufficient documentation             of the customer approval, and to support the cost.\n\n      b)    If premium outbound transportation is necessary due to MSL's             failure to ship on time, this cost is the responsibility of MSL             and IBM will invoice MSL for these costs.\n\n14.16 Integration SOW Completion\n\n      At the completion of an individual Integration SOW, a complete       reconciliation will be completed within 60 Days. This reconciliation will       be between MSL and the IBM project manager/customer and will include, but       not limited to, an inventory reconciliation, any outstanding cost and       disposition of all customer software and hardware in MSL's possession.\n\n14.17 Equipment\n\n      IBM will identify the current equipment, owned by IBM, needed to perform       Integration and it will be made available to MSL at an agreed to price per       Attachment 3 of the Base Agreement. If, at any time, MSL chooses to       replace Integration support equipment and the associated programs, IBM's       written concurrence will be required.\n\n14.18 Restrictions and Limitations\n\n      Nothing in this Agreement authorizes MSL to use any of IBM's tangible,       real or intangible property for the performance of any services       contemplated hereunder on IBM Logo products or for Integration services of       non-IBM Logo products related to a customer for whom Integration is being       provided by IBM. In any event, MSL will ensure that the IBM customer       delivery schedules will not be impacted based on other performance       obligations it may have during the term of the Agreement.\n\n14.19 Measurements/Reports\n\n      a)    MSL will be required to provide IBM with monthly reports detailing             their performance in relation to these Integration.\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 29 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n            These monthly report should provide at a minimum:\n\n            i)    On time delivery\n\n            ii)   Quality\n\n            iii)  Inventory management\n\n      b)    The specific targets are covered in this document under their             appropriate sections. These measurements should include a root cause             analysis, MSL actions to resolve and an action plan to achieve the             targeted objectives when there are deficiencies.\n\nSECTION 15.0 DROP SHIPMENTS\n\n      MSL will complete processes required to meet the following obligations       within [*] Days following the Effective Date.\n\n      a)    For Drop Shipments to IBM, MSL will be responsible for all             activities required to deliver the Products to the destination port             of the IBM company in the destination country. MSL will issue an IBM             invoice to the destination IBM company on behalf of the IBM business             area invoiced by MSL for these deliveries. MSL will ensure that             invoices and other required documentation are ready at the             destination port for timely importation into the country, but, MSL             will not be responsible for importation into the destination\n\n\n\n\n\n            country.\n\n      b)    For Drop Shipments in AP, MSL will transfer title to IBM when             Products are in \"highseas\" and after MSL has exported them through             the customs of the country of origin of the goods.\n\n      c)    For Drop Shipments to IBM customers, MSL will be responsible for all             activities required to deliver products to the customer in the             destination country, independently of when MSL transfers title of             property to IBM. MSL will be responsible for importation into the             destination country and delivery of Products to the customer after             clearing customs in that country. MSL will provide information to             IBM to allow IBM to issue an invoice to the final customer.\n\n      d)    For Drop Shipments to IBM US or IBM CANADA customers, MSL will             transfer title to IBM at the port of entry at USA or CANADA after             MSL has imported them through USA or CANADA customs.\n\n      e)    MSL will ensure timely distribution operations, irrespective of             whether MSL or another subcontractor is selected for outbound             distribution.\n\n      f)    MSL will comply with the IBM Import/Export Operation Application and             Instructions.\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 30 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\nSECTION 16.0 PACKAGING\n\n      MSL must meet requirements of IBM specification GA219261. MSL must also       package all Products according to packaging Specifications listed in the       Product Attachments. Each delivered container must be labeled and marked       so that the contents of the package can be identified without opening and       all boxes and packages must contain packing sheets listing contents. IBM's       part number, quantity and appropriate purchase order number must appear on       all packing sheets and bills of lading. In addition to standard IBM       packaging requirements, MSL must meet packaging, labeling and packing       sheet requirements of OEM customers.\n\nSECTION 17.0 QUALITY\n\n17.1  Commitment\n\n      MSL commits to provide all Products and related processes and material in       conformance in all material respects with the requirements of all       applicable IBM and MSL specifications. MSL shall ensure that with respect       to assembly and workmanship, all material requirements, IBM's quality       requirements and all applicable industry standards are met.\n\n17.2  Quality Requirements\n\n      a)    MSL's target is [*]% defect free production. MSL shall follow an             established continuous improvement program directed toward zero             defect production. MSL will report progress quarterly to IBM.

Other specific standard compliance requirements are             defined in the Product Attachments.\n\n      c)    For MSL's programs described in 17.2 a above, MSL will maintain             pertinent control charts in fundamental variables or attributes that             affect IBM's specifications. These charts will be updated on a             periodic basis, and provided to IBM upon request. Exceptions to the             limits will be highlighted to IBM along with corrective action             plans.\n\n      d)    A philosophy of continuous improvement shall be stated and             practiced. This means that effort will be expended to improved             processes by reducing or eliminating causes of variability, even             after the process is \"in control\" to meet specifications.\n\n      e)    Modifications, adds or deletions, to process steps by MSL must be             done with concurrence by IBM.\n\n      f)    MSL will take demonstrable action whenever a process goes out of             control parameters. The record of what was done and what results             were achieved shall be clearly documented and related directly on             the control charts.\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 31 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n\n\n\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n      g)    MSL will maintain an ongoing reliability test program for Products             requested by IBM (quality plan attachments) and will submit reports             as specified in the appropriate specification(s) listed in the             Product Attachment(s).\n\n      h)    MSL shall supply a Failure Analysis report for rejected material             within [*] weeks after receipt. After the Failure Analysis plan is             completed, MSL shall forward a corrective action plan for MSL             Procured Parts that is acceptable to IBM. MSL is responsible for             first pass Failure Analysis (i.e. identification of the failure to             the level of material provided to MSL by IBM) on IBM provided             materials. IBM may provide engineering support to investigate any             IBM Nominated Supplier components which are confirmed defective by             MSL failure analysis, but which are reported NDF (No defect found)             by the IBM Nominated Supplier.\n\n      i)    IBM and MSL will conduct regular meetings together to cover open             issues. Both parties will share openly their problems relevant to             the relationship.\n\n      j)    MSL shall follow the quality specifications identified in the             Product Attachments.\n\n17.3  MSL Support for IBM Customer Warranty\n\n      MSL agrees to:\n\n      a)    provide IBM a monthly shipment list by machine type and serial             number, as listed in the attached Performance Appendix,\n\n      b)    identify at product level all units to facilitate recall or             notification,\n\n      c)    obtain supplier support to implement needed changes,\n\n      d)    support IBM services planning groups on warranty cost reduction task             forces as needed,\n\n      e)    receive warranty and quality claims from the field, including OEM             customers, perform first pass failure analysis when needed, and             forward data and materials to their sources, or to IBM under IBM             instruction,\n\n      f)    provide warranty replacement support to OEM customers to include             receiving, tracking; and fulfillment of parts replacement to OEM             customers and,\n\n      g)    provide Part traceability to machine serial number as defined in             Product Attachments.\n\nSECTION 18.0 ACCEPTANCE TEST\n\n      a)    IBM may conduct, at its own expense, source inspection, , and/or             acceptance tests to assure that Products furnished by MSL conform to             specification, samples and/or descriptions as set forth in this             Agreement and the Product Attachment(s). IBM may reject any units of             Product which it finds in good faith not to meet the specifications             of this Agreement in any material respects. IBM should perform             incoming inspection within [*] Days after receipt of goods by IBM.             If IBM has not notified MSL of any defects in a unit of Product             within [*] Days of receipt, such unit shall\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 32 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n            be deemed to be accepted. Acceptance by IBM of Product shall not             relieve MSL of any responsibility for latent non-conformance with             IBM specifications, fraud, negligence, title defects, or             infringement or warranty. Failure by IBM to perform testing shall             not be construed as a waiver to later asserting claims based on such             above mentioned defects.\n\n      b)    Acceptance of new Products by IBM shall not occur until a letter             documenting acceptance and any conditions of acceptance has been             issued to MSL by IBM. New Products are not subject to the [*] Day             from receipt requirement defined in the preceding paragraph.\n\n18.1  Nonconforming Acceptance\n\n      a)    IBM may choose to accept Products which fail to conform to the\n\n\n\n\n\n            specifications established in a Product Attachment without prejudice             to its right to reject nonconforming items in the future. If IBM so             chooses, IBM will notify MSL of its intent to accept nonconforming             items. MSL agrees to negotiate in good faith a price reduction for             such items based upon IBM's reasonable added expense to correct and             otherwise deal with such deficiencies. After the parties agree on a             price, IBM will notify MSL that IBM has accepted the nonconforming             items. No items for which IBM has issued a notice of nonconformance             shall be deemed accepted, except as provided in the first sentence             of this Section.\n\n      b)    IBM's payments for Products shall not signify that IBM has accepted             Product.\n\nSECTION 19.0 WARRANTY\n\n19.1  Scope of Warranty\n\n      a)    MSL expressly warrants that all Products, MSL supplied materials and             Parts, and work prepared for IBM will conform in all material             respects to the specifications, drawings, or other descriptions             furnished or adopted by IBM, and will be of specified quality, good             workmanship, and free from defect subject to the following terms:\n\n            i)    MSL's warranty for IBM Designated Parts will be as long as,                   and will be on the same terms and conditions as the Parts                   supplier's warranty stated in the relevant purchasing                   contract.\n\n            ii)   MSL will not provide a warranty for IBM Parts. However, MSL                   will provide Failure Analysis for such parts. MSL will process                   such failed Parts as \"Return to MSL for credit to IBM\" in a                   timely manner.\n\n            iii)  MSL will not provide a warranty for consigned Products.                   However, MSL will provide failure analysis for such Products.                   MSL will process such failed Products per IBM's instruction in                   a timely manor.\n\n            iv)   MSL will warrant all MSL Procured Parts for [*] months unless                   otherwise stated in the applicable Product Attachment, or                   agreed to by IBM in writing.\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 33 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n            v)    MSL will warrant its workmanship for [*] months unless other                   stated in the applicable Product Attachment.\n\n      b)    All of the above described warranty periods will commence on the             date that the Products containing the above Parts are delivered to             IBM. The above warranties shall survive acceptance test, and IBM's             Product test procedure. MSL's warranty described above also covers             latent defects resulting from MSL's specification, workmanship,             process, and/or Parts purchased from MSL's suppliers and IBM's             Nominated Suppliers.\n\n19.2  Defective Field Replaceable Units\n\n      a)    A defective FRU shall be a FRU that does not conform in all material             respects to that Product's particular specifications.\n\n      b)    IBM will return defective FRUs that are under warranty to MSL             freight collect. MSL will perform Failure Analysis and incoming             inspection and testing as described in the applicable Product             Attachment for FRU's rejected or returned to MSL which are still             under warranty. If the rejected FRU passes all inspection and test             criteria, the FRU shall be classified as NDF and such FRU shall be             returned to IBM freight collect.\n\n19.3  Exclusions\n\n      The warranty set forth above specifically excludes and does not apply to       defects caused by a) the use or operation of the Product in an application       or environment other than as described in or contemplated by the       specifications issued by IBM or b) IBM or the end user through misuse,       excessive shock or improper maintenance procedures.\n\n19.4  Title\n\n      MSL warrants that the title to all Products purchased by and delivered to       a Delivery Point under this Agreement shall be free and clear of all       liens, encumbrances, security interests or other adverse interests or       claims. Title and risk of loss shall pass from MSL to IBM at time of       shipment per the IBM Customer Order, unless otherwise stated in Section       10.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n19.5  Returned Product Turn Around Time\n\n      MSL shall set an objective to complete Failure Analysis, repair or       replacement of defective Products, within [*] Days after receipt from IBM.       Upon or before the [*] Day, MSL will ship the repaired or replaced       Product, to IBM at MSL's expense. If repair or replacement is not       possible, MSL will refund to IBM, MSL's price associated with the failed       Product, that is under warranty and the price paid by IBM to MSL or any       third parties or the intercompany transfer price for IBM Parts, for all       Parts, if the price of such Parts were not included in MSL's price.\n\n19.6  Implied Warranties\n\n      a)    MSL'S WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION 19 ARE IN LIEU             OF AND ENTIRELY REPLACE ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS RELATING TO             THE QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, CONFORMANCE TO\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 34 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n            SPECIFICATION AND/OR FITNESS FOR PURPOSE OF THE PRODUCTS, WHETHER             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WHICH OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE HEREBY             EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED.\n\n      b)    IBM'S WARRANTIES CONTAINED HEREIN AND ANY PRODUCT ATTACHMENT WITH             RESPECT TO PARTS, IF ANY, ARE IN LIEU OF AND ENTIRELY REPLACE ALL             OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS RELATING TO THE QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY,             CONFORMANCE TO SPECIFICATIONS AND/OR FITNESS FOR PURPOSE WHETHER             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WHICH OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE HEREBY             EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED.\n\n19.7  Epidemic Failure\n\n      In the case where any specific Product, shipped to IBM from MSL within any       [*] month experiences a defect rate of [*]% or greater, resulting from a       common cause due to MSL's non-conformance to specifications, drawings,       other descriptions furnished or adopted by IBM, or due to workmanship, MSL       will accept the cost of a Product Recall.\n\nSECTION 20.0 COMMON TOOLING\n\n      Tools commonly used in production and/or Integration will be owned and       managed by MSL.\n\nSECTION 21.0 TOOLING TO BE ACQUIRED\n\n21.1  Purchase\n\n      a)    MSL will submit requests for additional tooling, if any, quarterly             for inclusion in IBM's capital request process.\n\n      b)    MSL shall not purchase any tooling or other capital equipment on             IBM's account without IBM's prior written approval.\n\n            i)    If specifically required in a Product Attachment, IBM will                   supply tooling for Products to MSL. It shall be IBM's option                   whether the tooling will be consigned by IBM to MSL or                   purchased by MSL.\n\n            ii)   If IBM elects to have MSL purchase tooling, MSL shall be                   responsible for the design, cost and build of all new or                   replacement tooling which shall be capable of producing                   Product in accordance with the IBM specification in the                   Product Attachment. MSL warrants that the tooling used under                   this Agreement shall be capable of producing the quantity of                   Product as specified by IBM.\n\n            iii)  If IBM elects to have MSL purchase the tooling, MSL shall                   invoice IBM for the cost of such tooling at such time as the                   tooling is placed into service. The cost of such tooling                   includes, but is not limited to, the cost of any purchased                   components (including parts and complete items), fully                   burdened MSL engineering and/or manufacturing labor use in the                   design and/or construction of such tools, duties, insurance,                   transportation, installation, costs and costs of\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 35 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n                  money, if any. MSL agrees that MSL engineering will be priced                   to IBM on a \"most favored customer\" basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n            iv)   Both parties may agree to amortize the tooling and shall put                   such agreement in writing and any terms and conditions                   associated with such amortization. If IBM and MSL agree to                   amortize the tooling, IBM agrees to pay for the tooling and                   any associated carrying cost agreed to between the Parties via                   an amortization charge in addition to the respective Product                   price as defined in Section 7.0. The amortization period for                   each tool will be stated in the applicable Product Attachment                   and shall be triggered by the initial delivery of the                   Product(s) for which the tooling expenses are incurred.\n\n                  IBM will state the estimated ship quantity and maximum monthly                   ship rate for the amortization period. MSL will define the                   total tooling cost to support the maximum ship rate. The total                   tooling cost will be divided by the estimated ship quantity                   provided by IBM. This unit amortization cost will be itemized                   in MSL's quotes as \"tooling adder\".\n\n            v)    The tooling cost recovery, via the \"tooling adder\", will be                   analyzed during each quarterly review meeting between IBM and                   MSL. The intent is to adjust the \"tooling adder\" based upon                   volume changes, such that the total tooling cost will be                   recovered by the end of the amortization period. If at the end                   of the amortization period the tooling cost have been over or                   under recovered, an adjustment invoice will be processed                   accordingly.\n\n      c)    MSL acknowledges and agrees that its utilization of any tooling for             other customers will not impact IBM's product requirements. MSL will             obtain IBM's written approval prior to entering into a contract with             a third party involving tooling for Products listed in the Product             Attachment.\n\n      d)    In the event that MSL owns the tooling and has received a bona fide             third party offer to purchase any or all of the tooling, before MSL             may accept such offer, MSL shall notify IBM in writing, and IBM             shall have [*] Days after such notice to agree to purchase such             tooling on the same terms and conditions as such third party offer.\n\n      e)    All tools, dies, jigs, patterns, equipment or Parts purchased,             furnished, charged to or paid for by IBM and any replacement thereof             shall become and remain the property of IBM. IBM agrees to provide             MSL appropriate technical support for IBM owned tooling at no charge             to MSL. IBM shall have the option of removing IBM owned tooling from             MSL directly, depending upon Product strategy and production.\n\n21.2  Care\n\n      MSL is responsible for protection, calibration, maintenance and care of       all tooling owned by IBM and shall be liable for loss or damage of such       tooling while in MSL's possession or control. IBM agrees to insure tooling       it owns. Where possible, MSL will be jointly insured with respect to the       IBM owned tooling for its interest. This tooling shall be subject to       inspection by IBM upon notice and shall be returned in an acceptable       condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted, upon demand or notice by       IBM. MSL will be responsible for\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 36 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n      removing and shipping IBM owned tooling from MSL's plant. IBM shall be       responsible for transportation cost for the return of tooling to IBM's       facility as designed by IBM.\n\n21.3  Inspection\n\n      MSL will identify the location of tooling and at any reasonable time allow       IBM or IBM's designee to inspect the equipment and to purchase related       parts. MSL shall not mortgage, pledge, or take any other action that might       encumber IBM owned tooling in any way.\n\nSECTION 22.0 RETURN OF PRODUCT - US AND VALENCIA WORK CENTER.\n\n22.1  Return to MSL by IBM\n\n      a)    MSL agrees to manage Products and Parts that can be returned to the             US and Valencia Work Centers through the following, but not limited             to, IBM processes, IBM Document PC 2801:\n\n            i)    shipped and uninstalled,\n\n            ii)   returns per IBM contracts with IBM Business Partners, and\n\n            iii)  new defective\n\n      b)    MSL will accept the return of all shipped Products returned to MSL             within [*] Days from the Delivery Date.\n\n\n\n\n\n            i)    Products returned to the US Work Center will be shipped                   freight [*] to MSL.\n\n            ii)   For Products returned to the Valencia Work Center, MSL will                   pay IBM the NIC for the returned Products (NIC is the [*]                   multiplied by the NIC rates defined in Section 1.b)ii) of                   Appendix 1.)\n\n            iii)  MSL will buy back the returned Product at [*]% of the amount                   invoiced to IBM for such Product within [*] Days of receipt of                   the return by MSL.\n\n            iv)   MSL's price for the acceptance of returned non-warranty                   Products shall be [*]% of the amount invoiced to IBM for such                   Product [*] NIC (NIC is the [*] multiplied by the NIC rates                   defined in Section 1.b) ii) of Appendix 1).\n\n            v)    For the Valencia Work Center, 22.1 b) iii) and iv) will be                   processed as MSL buying back the returned Product at [*]% of                   the amount invoiced to IBM [*] NIC within [*] Days of                   receipt of the return by MSL.\n\nIBM Confidential                                                   Page 37 of 39 sow0501.lwp\n\n                                  ATTACHMENT 1\n\n              IBM/MSL Outsourcing Base Agreement Statement of Work\n\n            vi)   IBM may use payments due IBM per 22.1 b) iii) and iv) to                   offset amounts owed to MSL or request reimbursement from                   MSL at IBM's sole discretion.\n\n            vii)  Any defective Product returned to MSL will be returned with a                   copy of any applicable IBM inspection report and will                   reference MSL's Return Material Authorization (\"RMA\").\n\n            viii) When replacement or repaired Products are shipped, MSL must                   submit a new invoice.\n\nSECTION 23.0 DISASTER RECOVERY\n\n      MSL will have a documented disaster recovery program which would allow MSL       to resume all responsibilities under the terms and conditions of this       Agreement within [*] Days of a disaster.

The Forecast represents the requirements that was passed by IBM [*] months prior, for the total volume by machine type for the quarter that is being measured. Actual Order Load represents the final amount of orders scheduled for the quarter being measured. For example when measuring the [*] for the first quarter in 1998 you would calculate [*] by taking the [*] that was passed [*] for the first [*] in [*] and subtract the actual [*] for that [*]. Then divide by the forcast and multiply by [*]. You follow the same methodology for [*] looking at the forecast [*] months prior to the last month of the quarter being measured. Once [*] through [*] is calculated you apply these results to the formula above.\n\n                                       [*]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe formula measures the accuracy of requirements placed on MSL for a given quarter, each month, starting [*] months prior to the end of the quarter, using a [*] weighted calculation.\n\nThe following percentages will be multiplied by the material cost of the volume of the machine type shipped in the quarter that fell below [*]% of the Requirements Accuracy calculation.\n\n            REQUIREMENTS ACCURACY          INCREMENTAL %             AS DEFINED ABOVE               APPLIED TO MATERIAL COST                                                         [*] and Greater                  [*]%                Less than [*]%                   [*]%\n\nPayments for these liabilities will be made via a separate invoice.\n\nIBM and MSL Confidential                                           Page 3 of 7\n\nAPPENDIX 3: PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS\n\nThe following SPECIFICATIONS apply to MSL services at each work center:\n\nMeasurement                              Period           Target ------------------------                 ------           ------                                                      On-time shipment (a)(c)                             [*] Responsiveness (b)(c) Order to ship leadtime (Pick&Pack) (d) Order to ship leadtime (Bulk) (d) Product quality Serviceability to IBM Plants Serviceability to IBM Services\n\n(a) Percentage of finished orders that are shipped from MSL and delivered to     IBM on the committed Delivery Date.

The       Supplement will also contain a non-confidential description of the       specific Information to be disclosed and any additional terms for that       Information.\n\n      The only time Recipient and Discloser are required to sign the Supplement       is when it contains additional terms. When signatures are not required,       the Recipient indicates acceptance of Information under the terms of this       Agreement by participating in the disclosure, after receipt of the       Supplement.\n\nSECTION 2 DISCLOSURE\n\n      The Discloser and Recipient's Point of Contact will coordinate and control       the disclosure.

If Information is not marked with such legend or is disclosed orally:\n\n            1)    The Information will be identified as confidential at the time                   of disclosure, and             2)    The Discloser will promptly provide the Recipient with written                   summary.\n\nSECTION 3 OBLIGATION\n\n      The Recipient agrees to:\n\n            1)    use the same care and discretion to avoid disclosure,                   publication or dissemination of the Discloser's Information as                   it uses with its own similar Information that it does not wish                   to disclose, publish or disseminate; and             2)    use the Discloser's Information for the purpose for which it                   was disclosed or otherwise for the benefit of the Discloser.\n\n      The Recipient may disclose Information to:\n\n                                                                     Page 2 of 5\n\n            1)    its employees and employees of its parent and subsidiary                   companies who have a need to know; and             2)    any other party with the Discloser's prior written consent.\n\n\n\n\n\n      Before disclosure to any of the above parties, the Recipient will have a       written agreement with such party sufficient to require that party to       treat information in accordance with this Agreement.\n\n      The Recipient may disclose Information to the extent required bylaw.       However, the Recipient must give the Discloser prompt notice to allow the       Discloser a reasonable opportunity to obtain a protective order.\n\nSECTION 4 CONFIDENTIALITY PERIOD\n\n      Information disclosed pursuant to this Agreement will be subject to the       terms of this Agreement for [*] years following the Final Disclosure Date.\n\nSECTION 5 EXCEPTIONS TO OBLIGATIONS\n\n      The Recipient may disclose, publish, disseminate, and use Information that       is:\n\n            1)    already in its possession without obligation of                   confidentiality;             2)    developed independently;             3)    obtained from a source other than the Discloser without                   obligation of confidentially;             4)    publicly available when received, or thereafter becomes                   publicly available through no fault of the Recipient; or             5)    disclosed by the Discloser to another party without obligation                   of confidentially.\n\nSECTION 6 RESIDUAL INFORMATION\n\n      The recipient may disclose, publish, disseminate, and use the ideas,       concepts, know-how and techniques, related to the Recipient's business       activities, which are contained in the Discloser's information and       retained in the memories of Recipient's employees who have had access to       the Information pursuant to this Agreement (Residual Information).\n\n      Nothing contained in this Section gives the Recipient the right to       disclose, publish, or disseminate, except as set forth elsewhere in this       Agreement:\n\n            1)    the source of Residual Information;             2)    any financial, statistical or personnel data of the                   Discloser; or             3)    the business plans of the Discloser.\n\nSECTION 7. DISCLAIMERS\n\n      THE DISCLOSER PROVIDES INFORMATION ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS.\n\n      The discloser will not be liable for any damages arising out of use of       Information disclosed hereunder.\n\n      Neither this Agreement nor any disclosure of Information hereunder grants       the Recipient any right or license under any trademark, copyright or       patent now or hereafter owned or controlled by the Discloser.\n\n      Disclosure of Information containing business plans is for planning       purposes only. The Discloser may change or cancel its plans at any time.       Use of such Information is at the Recipient's own risk.\n\n      The receipt of Information pursuant to this Agreement will not preclude,       or in any way limit, the Recipient from:\n\n                                                                     Page 3 of 5\n\n            1)    providing to others products or services which may be                   competitive with products or services of the Discloser;             2)    providing products or services to others who compete with the                   Discloser; or             3)    assigning its employees in any way it may choose.\n\nSECTION 8 GENERAL\n\n      This Agreement does not require either party to disclose or to receive       Information.\n\n      Neither party may assign, or otherwise transfer, its rights or delegate       its duties or obligations under this Agreement without prior written       consent. Any attempt to do so is void.\n\n      The Recipient will comply with all applicable United States and foreign       export laws and regulations.\n\n      Only a written agreement signed by both of us can modify this Agreement.\n\n      Either party may terminate this Agreement by providing [*] month's written       notice to the other.

(hereinafter called \"MSL\"), with an address at 5600 Mowry School Road, Newark, CA 94560.\n\nIBM and MSL agree that the following terms and conditions apply when IBM loans MSL equipment and programs including associated user manuals and similar documentation (Loaned Items). Loaned Items may also be referred to as Loaned Equipment or Loaned Programs, as applicable.\n\nSECTION 1 ASSOCIATED CONTRACT DOCUMENTS\n\n      Attachment 5 of the Outsourcing Agreement lists the Loaned Items. A       revised Attachment 5 sets forth any additions or deletions to the listed       Loaned Items. MSL's continued use of the Loaned Items or acceptance of       additional Loaned Items after its receipt of a revised Attachment 5 will       constitute its acceptance of such Attachment.\n\n      The loan of Loaned Items is made in conjunction with the IBM and MSL       Outsourcing Agreement dated _____________________ (\"Referenced       Agreement\") for the purpose of MSL fulfilling its responsibilities and       obligation as stated in the Reference Agreement.\n\nSECTION 2 TERM AND TERMINATION\n\n      Unless otherwise mutually agreed, the EPLA will be in effect for as long       as the Referenced Agreement is effective.\n\nSECTION 3 LOANED PERIOD\n\n      IBM will provide the Loaned Items to MSL on or about the Effective Date of       the Referenced Agreement. The Loan Period for each Loaned Item will extend       from the actual date IBM delivers the Loaned Items(s) to MSL, until the\n\n\n\n\n\n      earliest of:\n\n      a)    the applicable return date specified in the Attachment or revised             return date specified in a revised Attachment;\n\n      b)    the date MSL acquires i) title to the Loaned Equipment or ii) a             continuing license to the Loaned Program, should such acquisition or             licensing be available to MSL under Section 12: or\n\n      c)    on the Referenced Agreement expiration date.\n\nSECTION 4 AUTHORIZED USE\n\n      IBM provides Loaned Items to MSL solely for use in accordance with the       terms of this Agreement and for the Purpose of the loan described either       in this Agreement or in the Referenced Agreement (Authorized Use). There       are no charges for Authorized Use of the Loaned Items. MSL may not use the       Loaned Items for any other purposes.\n\nEPL00L(CLT-EPL 1.1-02/93)                                            Page 2 of 7\n\nSECTION 5 OWNERSHIP AND LICENSE\n\n      IBM or another party retains title to all Loaned Items. MSL may not       transfer Loaned Items to anyone else. For Loaned Programs which are not       subject to IBM's or another supplier's or publisher's license agreement,       IBM grants MSL a license to use, store, modify and make sufficient copies       to support MSL's Authorized Use under this Agreement. Such copies will be       deemed to be Loaned Items. For Loaned Programs which are subject to       another supplier's or publisher's license agreement, however, the terms       and conditions of that supplier or publisher are passed to MSL through       IBM. Such terms and conditions will be shipped with the Loaned Program.       For Loaned Programs which IBM licenses to others under an IBM license, the       terms of the applicable IBM license which are not inconsistent with this       Agreement apply. IBM will provide such terms to MSL upon request Any       authorized copies made by MSL will be deemed to be Loaned Items.\n\nSECTION 6 LICENSED INTERNAL CODE\n\n      If the Loaned Equipment contains Licensed Internal Code (Code), so       identified by IBM, IBM grants MSL a license only to execute such Code to       enable the Loaned Equipment to perform in accordance with IBM's official       published specifications. MSL may not reverse assemble, reverse compile,       decode, translate, or make any other copies of the Code. MSL must return       the original copy of the Code to IBM at the conclusion of the Loan Period.\n\nSECTION 7 DELIVERY AND INSTALLATION\n\n      IBM will deliver the Loaned Items to 8501 IBM Drive, Charlotte, NC 28262.\n\n      MSL will:\n\n            1)    set-up all Loaned Equipment, and\n\n            2)    install all Loaned Programs\n\nSECTION 8 RISK OF LOSS OR DAMAGE\n\n      IBM relieves MSL of the risk of loss of, or damage to, all Loaned Items,       except for loss or damage resulting from MSL's breach of this Agreement       including use other than Authorized Use.\n\nSECTION 9 SECURITY\n\n      MSL will provide, at no cost to IBM, adequate security to protect the       Loaned Items from theft, damage or misuse.\n\n      MSL will use reasonable care in the use of all Loaned Items. MSL will       provide an operating environment for the Loaned Items consistent with the       related user documentation.\n\n      MSL will keep the Loaned Items at the Installation Address specified in       the Attachment. MSL will not move the Loaned Items to another location       without IBM's prior written approval.\n\nSECTION 10 SERVICE AND SUPPORT\n\n      During the time the Loaned Items are in MSL's possession, MSL shall, at       its own expense:\n\n      a)    Develop and maintain the expertise to operate the Equipment             independent of IBM and ensure that the Equipment complies at all             times with all federal, state, and local governmental safety and             other requirement (including OSHA regulations). If MSL determines             that any of the Loaned Items received from IBM fails to comply with             any such requirements, MSL shall promptly notify IBM, and IBM shall\n\nEPL00L(CLT-EPL 1.1-02/93)                                            Page 3 of 7\n\n            either replace the Loaned Item or instruct MSL to modify the Loaned             Item so that it compiles, at IBM's expense.\n\n\n\n\n\n      b)    Service the Loaned Items and maintain them in good operating             condition at all times.\n\n      c)    Replace or repair all items lost, damaged or destroyed except to the             extent MSL proves to IBM that such loss, damage or destruction is             caused by circumstances beyond MSL's control. All replacement of             Loaned Items Shall become IBM property and shall be Subject to all             the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\n\n      MSL will permit IBM personnel full, free and safe access to MSL's       facilities, during normal business hours, after reasonable notice, for the       purpose of inspection and inventory as IBM deems necessary.\n\nSECTION 11 ALTERATIONS AND ATTACHMENTS\n\n      MSL may make an alteration to Loaned Equipment (e.g., a change in the       structure of the equipment) only upon IBM's prior written approval. MSL       may make an attachment to Loaned Equipment (e.g., coupling a printer to a       loaned personal computer) without notice to IBM.\n\n      MSL will remove any alteration or attachment and restore Loaned Equipment       to its unaltered condition before its return to IBM or upon IBM's notice       to MSL that the alteration or attachment creates a safety hazard or       renders maintenance of the Loaned Equipment impractical.\n\nSECTION 12 DISPOSITION OF LOANED ITEMS\n\n12.1  Return to IBM\n\n      MSL will return the Loaned Equipment to IBM at the end of the Loan Period,       except as may be provided for in this Section. MSL will return the Loaned       Equipment to IBM in the same condition as when delivered to MSL,       reasonable wear and tear excepted.\n\n      MSL will return the original and all copies of the Loaned Programs at the       end of the Loaned Period, except as may be provided in this Section.\n\n      MSL will permit IBM personnel access during IBM's normal business hours to       allow IBM to remove the Loaned Items.\n\n12.2  Acquisition and Continued Licensing\n\n      IBM will determine the availability of Loaned Equipment for MSL's       acquisition and Loaned Programs for MSL's continued licensing beyond the       applicable Loan Period. MSL must inform IBM, prior to the end of the       applicable Loan Period, of MSL's interest in the acquisition of specific       Loaned Equipment or the continued licensing of specific Loaned Programs.       IBM will then notify MSL in writing either;\n\n            1)    of the terms and conditions under which MSL may acquire such                   Loaned Equipment or continue to license such Loaned Programs,                   or\n\n            2)    that the Loaned Items are not available for acquisition or                   continued licensing.\n\n      Continued Licensing of Loaned Programs will be governed by the provisions       of the applicable IBM license agreement or another supplier's or       publisher's license agreement. IBM will identify to MSL the applicable       agreement which governs such licensing.\n\nEPL00L(CLT-EPL 1.1-02/93)                                            Page 4 of 7\n\nSECTION 13 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY\n\n      IBM PROVIDES LOANED ITEMS ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS. IBM MAKES NO WARRANTY,       EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ITEMS, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED       WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\nSECTION 14 PATENTS AND COPYRIGHTS\n\n      If the operation of a Loaned Item becomes, or IBM believes is likely to       become, the subject of a claim that it infringes a patent or copyright in       the United States or Puerto Rico, MSL will permit IBM, at its option and       expense, either to secure the right for MSL to continue using the Loaned       Item or to replace or modify it so that it becomes noninfringing. However,       if neither of the foregoing alternatives is available on terms which are       reasonable in IBM's judgment, MSL will return the Loaned Item upon IBM's       written request.\n\n      IBM will have no obligation with respect to any such claim based upon       MSL's modification of IBM equipment, programs or programming or their       combination, operation or use with any non-IBM apparatus, data or       programs.\n\n      IBM will not have any liability regarding patent or copyright infringement       for non-IBM Loaned Items.\n\n      This Section states IBM's entire obligations to MSL regarding infringement       or the like.\n\nSECTION 15 LIMITATION OF REMEDIES\n\n\n\n\n\n      IBM's entire liability and MSL's exclusive remedy for actual damages from       cause whatsoever relating to the subject matter of this Agreement will be       limited to the amount of $25,000. This limitation will apply, except as       otherwise stated in this Section, regardless of the form of action,       whether in contract or in tort, including negligence. This limitation will       not apply to claims by MSL for bodily injury or damage to real property or       tangible personal property for which IBM is legally liable.\n\n      In no event will IBM be liable for any lost profits, lost savings,       incidental damages, or other economic consequential damages, even if IBM       has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In addition, IBM will       not be liable for any damages claimed by IBM based on any third party       claim.\n\n      In no event will IBM be liable for any damages caused by MSL's failure to       perform MSL's responsibilities.\n\nSECTION 16 GENERAL\n\n      MSL may not assign this Agreement without IBM's prior written consent. Any       attempted assignment without such consent is void.\n\n      Loaned Items are to be installed only in the United States or Puerto Rico.\n\n      IBM will pay destination charges, both from and to IBM-designated       locations, for each Loaned Item shipped in accordance with IBM's then       current shipping practice. MSL will pay any rigging charges. MSL will       furnish all labor for unpacking and packing except as IBM otherwise       specifies or when performed at an IBM-designated location.\n\n      IBM may provide services described in this Agreement by using IBM-selected       independent contractors.\n\n      Neither party is responsible for failure to fulfill its obligations under       this Agreement due to causes beyond its control.\n\nEPL00L(CLT-EPL 1.1-02/93)                                            Page 5 of 7\n\n      Neither party may bring an action, regardless of form, arising out of this       Agreement more than [*] years after the cause of action arose.\n\n      In the event of termination or expiration of this Agreement, the       provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, extend beyond the       expiration or termination of this Agreement shall remain in effect beyond       such expiration or termination until fulfilled.\n\n      If there is a conflict between this Agreement and an Attachment, the terms       and conditions of the Attachment will prevail. Except as modified by an       Attachment the terms of this Agreement remain in full force and effect.

No Party shall attempt to enforce any Equity Commitment  Letter until the conditions set forth in this Section have been satisfied. Purchaser shall have no right to enforce any Equity Commitment Letter  unless and until directed to do so by the unanimous written consent of the Sponsors (other than any Defaulting Sponsor).     3.

Exercise of Rights and Remedies. No delay of or omission in the exercise of any right, power or remedy accruing to any party as a  result of any breach or default by any other party under this Agreement shall impair any such right, power or remedy, nor shall it be construed as a  waiver of or acquiescence in any such breach or default, or of any similar breach or default occurring later, nor shall any such delay, omission or  waiver of any single breach or default be deemed a waiver of any other breach or default occurring before or after such waiver.     20.

Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned by any party or by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent  of each of the other parties. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section shall be null and void.     23. No Representations or Duties. Each Sponsor specifically understands and agrees that no other Sponsor has made or will make any  representation or warranty with respect to the terms, value or any other aspect of the transactions contemplated hereby, and explicitly disclaims any warranty, express or implied, with respect to such matters.

Magliarditi                By:/s/Sanjay Bajaj Name: Dominic J.

The buyer has to be satisfied he/she received what they thought they were getting and the seller has to be sure he/she gets paid. i-Escrow holds payment from the buyer in trust until the seller sends the merchandise to the buyer. Once the buyer accepts the merchandise, i-Escrow forwards the payment to the seller by writing a check.  A typical escrow transaction: When an auction ends, your end of auction email contains links to i-Escrow. Once you have signed up with i-Escrow   you go through the following steps to complete your transaction. 1.   Start a transaction by entering the description and price of the merchandise along with email address of the other party. 2.   The other party receives an email from i-Escrow requesting an acknowledgement of the terms of the transaction. 3.   Once the transaction is acknowledged by the other party, the buyer pays i-Escrow the agreed upon price, by credit card or other means. 4.   i-Escrow informs the seller that payment has been received, requesting them to ship the merchandise directly to the buyer. 5.   The seller provides i-Escrow with the tracking number of the shipment. 6.   The buyer receives and accepts the merchandise. 7.   i-Escrow sends the check to the seller.\n\nFor more information about I-Escrow, visit their web-site at www.iescrow.com\n\nSource: 2THEMART COM INC, 10-12G, 8/26/1999"}]}, {"title": "MOELIS_CO_03_24_2014-EX-10.19-STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT", "answer_start": 3631}], "id": "MOELIS_CO_03_24_2014-EX-10.19-STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT__Document Name", "question": "The name of the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "Moelis & Company Holdings GP LLC", "answer_start": 4276}, {"text": "\"Moelis General Partner\", and together with Moelis Holdings, the \"Moelis Entities\"", "answer_start": 4415}, {"text": "Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation", "answer_start": 3749}, {"text": "SMBC Nikko Securities Inc.", "answer_start": 3920}, {"text": "SMBC, Nikko, Moelis Holdings and Moelis General Partner are each referred to herein as a \"party\" and collectively referred to as the \"parties", "answer_start": 4519}, {"text": "Moelis & Company Holdings LP", "answer_start": 4123}], "id": "MOELIS_CO_03_24_2014-EX-10.19-STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT__Parties", "question": "The two or more parties who signed the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "December 27, 2011", "answer_start": 197}], "id": "MOELIS_CO_03_24_2014-EX-10.19-STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT__Agreement Date", "question": "The date of the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "This Agreement shall be effective as of January 1, 2012 (the \"Effective Date\"), provided, however, that, ARTICLE XII and ARTICLE XIII shall not be effective until after the Closing.", "answer_start": 33701}], "id": "MOELIS_CO_03_24_2014-EX-10.19-STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT__Effective Date", "question": "The date when the contract is effective\u00a0", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "The initial term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and continue for three (3) years, subject to the prior termination rights provided below.", "answer_start": 33883}], "id": "MOELIS_CO_03_24_2014-EX-10.19-STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT__Expiration Date", "question": "On what date will the contract's initial term expire?", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "initial term.", "answer_start": 34310}, {"text": "At the end of such initial term, and any renewed term, as applicable, this Agreement shall automatically renew for an additional one (1) year term, unless a party provides written notice to the other parties at least six (6) months prior to the end of the", "answer_start": 34042}], "id": "MOELIS_CO_03_24_2014-EX-10.19-STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT__Renewal Term", "question": "What is the renewal term after the initial term expires?

There will be no other sharing of fees received from the seller between Moelis Holdings and SMB C/Nikko on any such assignments.   7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  4.3 Target Transactions.

Each of SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings agrees not to solicit or hire any employee of the other party during the term of this Agreement and for a period of 12 months thereafter; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to general solicitations to the public that are not specifically directed to employees of other party (or employment of applicants to such solicitations). Each of SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings agrees, during the term of this Agreement (except pursuant to this Agreement) and for a period of 12 months thereafter, not to solicit any Client Introduced by the other party in connection with an assignment on Covered   8\n\n\n\n\n\n  Businesses involving Japanese Companies where all principal parties involved are located within Covered Regions.

Each party shall notify the other parties if it replaces either of its designees to the Alliance Review Committee. The Alliance Review Committee will meet annually and will have the authority to recommend changes to the Strategic Alliance or this Agreement if deemed appropriate. For the avoidance of doubt, the recommendations of the Alliance Review Committee will not be binding upon any party unless and until this Agreement is amended or modified pursuant to Section 15.3.   ARTICLE VII.   TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT.   7.1 Training and Development. During the term of this Agreement, Moelis Holdings shall offer certain full-time analysts and associates of SMBC/Nikko, or employees with similar responsibilities, the opportunity to participate annually in Moelis Holdings' training program for newly hired full-time analysts and associates, to the extent that Moelis Holdings' holds such a program.

(c) SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings will from time to time during the term of this Agreement, review and discuss the secondment program and such additions and changes the parties consider appropriate to further the Strategic Alliance.   ARTICLE VIII.   ENGAGEMENTS.   8.1 Engagement Letters and other Agreements.   (a) Parties. Where the parties are executing an assignment together pursuant to this Agreement, it is anticipated that generally both parties (or one of their respective affiliates) will sign the engagement letter (and, where necessary, other relevant agreements) with the relevant Client in connection with the assignment. In certain limited circumstances mutually agreed upon by the parties, one party may sign the engagement letter with the Client and then such party would also sign an agreement with the other party or parties for such party or parties to provide services to the Client and receive compensation, indemnification and other protections after receiving the written consent of such Client.   (b) Rights and Obligations. The engagement letters will (unless otherwise agreed) include a provision to the effect that: \"The rights and obligations of SMBC, Nikko and Moelis Holdings are the several rights and obligations of SMBC, Nikko and Moelis Holdings and that each of SMBC, Nikko or Moelis Holdings shall not be liable or responsible for the actions or omissions of the others.\"   (c) Payment. The engagement letters will (unless otherwise agreed) provide that payments would be made to either SMBC/Nikko or Moelis Holdings and SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings will split the fees pursuant to this Agreement.   10\n\n\n\n\n\n  8.2 Expenses.

Each party shall have its own separate conflict identification, business selection and client vetting procedures. The parties will cooperate to identify and resolve potential conflict issues.   8.4 Compliance with Laws. In the case where one party executes an engagement letter with a Client (the \"Main-Advisor Party\") and the Main-Advisor Party appoints and retains the other party or parties as a sub-advisor (the \"Sub-Advisor Party\"), each of the Main-Advisor Party and the Sub-Advisor Party shall comply in all material respects with all applicable laws or regulations, including the UK Bribery Act 2010, the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and any other similar anti-bribery act in its execution and performance of its services for the Covered Businesses for such Client. If either of the Main-Advisor Party or Sub-Advisor Party breaches its obligations set forth in this Section 8.4, the non- breaching party shall have the right to immediately terminate its sub-advisor agreement or any other similar agreement entered into with respect to the Covered Businesses for such Client by providing a written notice to the breaching party that specifically identifies how the breaching party has breached this Section 8.4.   ARTICLE IX.   JOINT MARKETING.   9.1 Joint Marketing. The parties shall establish a joint marketing effort for the Strategic Alliance. Among other things, the parties shall agree upon a joint press release and communication strategy for announcing the Strategic Alliance and certain joint marketing materials which either party may use in marketing to Clients.   ARTICLE X.   CONFIDENTIALITY.   10.1 Confidentiality. The parties each agree to keep confidential all non-public information disclosed by another party or a Client or prospective Client or a representative thereof in connection with the Strategic Alliance (including this Agreement) (\"Confidential Information\"), (i) except to subsidiaries, affiliates or their professional advisors (and provided that the Party shall cause the recipient to assume and perform the confidentiality obligations equivalent to those imposed on such party under this Agreement and shall be responsible for breach of such obligations by such recipient) and (ii) except as required by judicial process or such party's regulatory authorities, and   11\n\n\n\n\n\n  to use such information only for purposes of the Strategic Alliance (including this Agreement); provided, however, that Confidential Information shall not include (i) information that is already in the receiving party's possession when it is received and not subject to a confidentiality agreement or other obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing party, (ii) information separately obtained by the receiving party from a third party that is not known or should not reasonably be known to the person receiving such information to be bound by a confidentiality agreement or other obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing party and (iii) information independently developed by the receiving party without any use of Confidential Information. In the event that any disclosure of Confidential Information is required by judicial process or such party's regulatory authorities, the party required to make such disclosure shall, to the extent commercially practicable and legally permissible, consult with the party that provided such Confidential Information prior to making any such disclosure. Nothing in this section shall restrict the receiving party's ability to make any legally required disclosures of Confidential Information to bank examiners or other supervisory authorities having jurisdiction over the receiving party. Each of Moelis Holdings and SMBC/Nikko shall also ask the other if it has internally cleared the receipt of non-public information regarding a Client or prospective Client before the party providing such information delivers any such information to the receiving party. Due to Japanese firewall restrictions, (i) SMBC will not disclose Confidential Information relating to its Clients to Nikko (ii) Nikko will not disclose Confidential Information relating to its Clients to SMBC and (iii) Moelis Holdings shall not disclose Confidential Information relating to a Client received from SMBC or any of its affiliates (excluding Nikko and any person that would be an affiliate of Nikko if Nikko were not an affiliate of SMBC) (an \"SMBC Affiliate\") to Nikko or its affiliates (excluding SMBC and any person that would be an affiliate of SMBC if Nikko were not an affiliate of SMBC) (a \"Nikko Affiliate\") or Confidential Information relating to a Client received from Nikko or any Nikko Affiliate to SMBC or any SMBC Affiliate, without first obtaining such Client's consent to such disclosure. This Section 10.1 shall terminate with respect to Confidential Information relating to a (prospective) Client, two years following receipt of such information, and with respect to any other Confidential Information, two years following the termination of this Agreement.   ARTICLE XI.   TERM   11.1 Term. This Agreement shall be effective as of January 1, 2012 (the \"Effective Date\"), provided, however, that, ARTICLE XII and ARTICLE XIII shall not be effective until after the Closing. The initial term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and continue for three (3) years, subject to the prior termination rights provided below. At the end of such initial term, and any renewed term, as applicable, this Agreement shall automatically renew for an additional one (1) year term, unless a party provides written notice to the other parties at least six (6) months prior to the end of the   12\n\n\n\n\n\n  initial term.

CERTAIN RIGHTS OF SMBC/NIKKO.   12.1 Advisory Board. During the term of the Strategic Alliance, SMBC/Nikko shall have the right to appoint one person to serve as a member of the Advisory Board of Moelis Holdings.   12.2 Right of First Refusal.   (a) Prior to the IPO and during the term of the Strategic Alliance, SMBC shall have the right of first refusal to purchase all (but not less than all) Additional Units that Moelis Holdings proposes to issue to an SMBC Competitor, including (x) in a proposed issuance that is excepted from Section 3.4.2 of the Moelis Holdings Agreement as an issuance to a Strategic Investor, and (y) in a proposed issuance that is subject to Section 3.4.2 of the Moelis Holdings Agreement, to the extent that the Partners do not exercise in full their right of first refusal thereunder. The above rights are in addition to the pro rata right of first refusal granted to all Partners with respect to issuances of Additional Units in Section 3.4.2 of the Moelis Holdings Agreement.   (b) In the event Moelis Holdings proposes to undertake an issuance of Additional Units to which clause (x) of Section 12.2(a) applies, it shall give SMBC written notice of its intention describing the price and terms upon which Moelis Holdings proposes to issue the same. SMBC shall have ten (10) days from the date of delivery of any such notice to agree to purchase all, but not less than all, of such Additional Units, for the price and upon the terms specified in the notice, by delivering written notice to Moelis Holdings. Following the expiration of such 10-day period, Moelis Holdings shall have one hundred and eighty- (180-) days to sell or enter into an agreement to sell the Additional Units with respect to which SMBC's right of first refusal was not exercised, at a price and upon terms no more favorable to the purchasers of such securities than specified in Moelis Holdings' notice. In the event Moelis Holdings has not sold the Additional Units or entered into an agreement to sell the Additional Units within such one hundred and eighty- (180-) day period, Moelis Holdings shall not thereafter issue or sell any Additional Units without first complying again with this Section 12.2.   (c) In the event Moelis Holdings proposes to undertake any issuance of Additional Units to which clause (y) of Section 12.2(a) applies, SMBC shall specify in its notice delivered to Moelis Holdings pursuant to Section 3.4.2(b) of the Moelis Holdings Agreement, in addition to whether or not it elects to purchase its pro rata portion of such Additional Units, whether or not it shall exercise its right of first refusal to purchase all (but not less than all) of the Additional Units that other Partners do not purchase pursuant to their right of first refusal under Section 3.4.2 of the Moelis Holdings Agreement.   (d) The right of first refusal granted hereunder may not be assigned or transferred, except that such right is assignable by SMBC to any of its respective Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries.   14\n\n\n\n\n\n  12.3 Moelis General Partner's Consent to Certain Transfers.   (a) Prior to the IPO and during the term of the Strategic Alliance, Moelis General Partner shall not consent to a sale or transfer by a Partner of its Partnership Interests to an SMBC Competitor unless the Moelis General Partner caused the Partner proposing to sell or transfer its Partnership Interests to provide SMBC with a right to purchase, on the same terms and conditions, including price, all (but not less than all) of the Partnership Interests that such Partner proposes to sell or transfer to an SMBC Competitor.   (b) In the event a Partner proposes to undertake a sale or transfer of Partnership Interests to which the foregoing right applies, and Moelis General Partner must consent to the sale or transfer, Moelis General Partner shall require that Partner to give SMBC written notice of its intention to sell or transfer Partnership Interests to an SMBC Competitor describing the price and terms upon which such Partner proposes to sell or transfer its Partnership Interests. SMBC shall have ten (10) days from the date of delivery of any such notice to agree to purchase all, but not less than all, of such Partnership Interests, for the price and upon the terms specified in the notice, by delivering written notice to such Partner and Moelis Holdings.   (c) Following the expiration of such 10-day period, the Partner proposing to sell or transfer Partnership Interests shall have one hundred and eighty- (180-) days to sell or transfer, or enter into an agreement to sell or transfer the Partnership Interests with respect to which SMBC 's right under Section 12.3(a) was not exercised, at a price and upon terms no more favorable to the purchasers of such securities than specified in the Partner's notice. In the event the Partner has not sold or transferred the Partnership Interests, or entered into an agreement to sell or transfer the Partnership Interests, within such one hundred and eighty- (180-) day period, Moelis General Partner shall not consent to the Partner's selling or transferring its Partnership Interests to an SMBC Competitor thereafter without first requiring the Partner to comply again with this Section 12.3.   (d) The rights granted under this Section 12.3 may not be assigned or transferred, except that such right is assignable by SMBC to any of its respective Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries.   (e) Nothing in this Section 12.3 shall affect the power of Moelis General Partner to withhold consent to any transfer of Partnership Interests in its sole discretion to the extent authorized under Section 8.1 of the Moelis Holdings Agreement.   12.4 Certain Transfer Matters.   (a) During the term of the Strategic Alliance, if KM sells all or a portion of KM's Partnership Interests, the SMBC Unit-Holders may sell a pro rata portion of the SMBC Units without regard to any timing or transfer restrictions imposed by this Agreement or the Moelis Holdings Agreement, except that such sale or transfer may not be to a Moelis Competitor. In the event KM proposes to undertake a sale or   15\n\n\n\n\n\n  transfer of KM's Partnership Interests to which the foregoing right applies, KM shall give written notice to SMBC and Moelis General Partner at least ten (10) days in advance of such sale or transfer, describing the percent of KM's Partnership Interest being sold or transferred. KM shall give written notice to SMBC and Moelis General Partner within five (5) days of any cancellation or postponement of such sale. When an SMBC Unit- Holder elects to sell or transfer the SMBC Units pursuant to its rights granted under this Section 12.4(a), the SMBC Unit-Holder shall provide Moelis General Partner with a notice stating its intent to sell or transfer the SMBC Units pursuant to this Section 12.4(a). Within ten (10) days of receiving such notice from an SMBC Unit-Holder, Moelis General Partner shall deliver to such SMBC Unit-Holder its consent for the proposed sale or transfer, unless the proposed sale or transfer is to a Moelis Competitor. For the avoidance of doubt, if the transaction is subject to (i) a Drag- Along Right or a Tag-Along Right, and such right was exercised, the SMBC Unit-Holders shall be deemed to have sold its pro rata portion of its Partnership Interests with respect to such transaction and shall not have any additional rights under this Section 12.4(a) or (ii) Section 13.2 of this Agreement, and an SMBC Unit-Holder exercised its right thereunder, such SMBC Unit-Holder shall be deemed to have sold its pro rata portion of its Partnership Interests with respect to such transaction and shall not have any additional rights under this Section 12.4(a). The above right shall be in addition to the Drag-Along Right and the Tag-Along Right with respect to transfers by Moelis General Partner set forth in Sections 8.4.1 and 8.4.2, respectively, of the Moelis Holdings Agreement.   (b) During the term of the Strategic Alliance, and after the first anniversary of Moelis Holdings' commencing a public registered share sale program for managing directors and other employees of Moelis Holdings or its affiliates, the SMBC Unit-Holders may sell or transfer Partnership Interests pursuant to such public registered share sale program for any given period in an amount equal to (i) the number of Partnership Interests that can be sold pursuant to the program in such period multiplied by (ii) a fraction whose numerator is the number of Partnership Interests the SMBC Unit-Holders have elected to sell in such program during such period and whose denominator is the total number of Partnership Interests the SMBC Unit-Holders have elected to sell plus the number of Partnership Interests all other persons have elected to sell in such program during such period (whether such Partnership Interests are held as outstanding common stock of a successor or parent company of Moelis Holdings or as interests in an affiliate of such public company) (for example, if 50 Partnership Interests can be sold during the period, the SMBC Unit-Holders has elected to sell 400 Partnership Interests and all persons other than the SMBC Unit-Holders have elected to sell 1,600 Partnership Interests, then the SMBC Unit-Holders may sell 10 Partnership Interests and the other persons may sell 40 Partnership Interests); provided, that, (1) the SMBC Unit-Holders shall be subject to the same conditions and terms as the other participants in the program; (2) such right under this Section 12.4(b) shall not apply to sales Moelis Holdings may permit certain of its managing directors and other employees to make under Rule 144 or otherwise; and (3) if both Section 12.4(a) and Section 12.4(b) apply to a sale or transfer of Partnership Interests, an SMBC Unit-Holder may sell the higher of the amount under Section 12.4(a) or Section 12.4(b). If such public registered share sale program as set forth in this Section 12.4(b) is established, Moelis Holding will provide the SMBC Unit-Holders with a monthly report which provides the number of Partnership Interests being   16\n\n  sold in such share sale program during the relevant month and the outstanding number of Partnership Interests that are left in the public sale registered sale program as of the end of the relevant month.   (c) After the termination of the Strategic Alliance:   (i) prior to the IPO, Moelis General Partner shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to an SMBC Unit-Holder's transferring all or a portion of the SMBC Units to any other person who is not a Moelis Competitor; and   (ii) following the IPO, the SMBC Unit-Holders may freely transfer the SMBC Units, subject to applicable securities laws.   (d) Following the third anniversary of the Closing, whether or not during the term of the Strategic Alliance, the SMBC Unit- Holders may sell up to 9,231 SMBC Units (i) prior to the IPO, with the consent of Moelis General Partner (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld), provided such sale is not to a Moelis Competitor, or (ii) following the IPO, without restriction, subject only to applicable securities laws.   (e) During the term of the Strategic Alliance and prior to the IPO, Moelis Holdings shall notify SMBC in advance of publicly announcing the sale or issuance of any interests in Moelis Holdings (other than Management Units) to a Strategic Investor, provided, that Moelis Holdings shall notify SMBC in advance only to the extent and in such manner as it is permissible under any confidentiality agreement entered into in connection with such sale or issuance.   12.5 Amendments to the Moelis Holdings Agreement. Without the prior written consent of SMBC (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), Moelis General Partner shall not enter into any side letter or agreement (other than the Vesting Agreement of any Management Partner) with any Limited Partner in respect of the issuance or holding of any class or type of interests in the Partnership that (i) modifies the limited liability of the SMBC Unit-Holders, (ii) materially and adversely affects in a disproportionate manner the interest of the SMBC Unit-Holders in Net Income, Net Loss or Available Assets, (iii) increases the Capital Contributions required to be made by the SMBC Unit-Holders, (iv) modifies the SMBC Unit-Holders' Drag-Along Rights or Tag-Along Rights under the Moelis Holdings Agreement, or (v) materially and adversely affects in a disproportionate manner the interest of the SMBC Unit-Holders in the distributions, regardless of whether such side letter or agreement is entered into by such Limited Partner in its capacity as such, and regardless of whether SMBC is entitled to participate or does participate in such issuance of or otherwise holds any such interests; provided, however, the foregoing consent of SMBC shall not be required if the side letter or agreement affects Management Units in a substantially similar manner.   17\n\n\n\n\n\n  12.6 Percentage Interest Limit. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Moelis Holdings Agreement, none of SMBC, Moelis Holdings or any of their controlled affiliates shall take any action, including with respect to the acquisition of any Partnership Interests pursuant to the exercise of any right under this Agreement or the Moelis Holdings Agreement, that would reasonably be expected to (i) cause SMBC, or any of its affiliates, to require approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under Section 4 of the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (including Regulation Y promulgated thereunder), or otherwise, to acquire or retain any interest in Moelis Holdings or (ii) cause Moelis Holdings to be deemed to be or presumed to be \"controlled\" by SMBC, or any of its affiliates, for purposes of the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (including Regulation Y promulgated thereunder). SMBC and Moelis Holdings shall cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to avoid any of the events in the preceding sentence by taking any and all actions necessary, including, without limitation, in connection with any restructuring to facilitate the IPO, which shall include, among other things, issuing a new class or series of Partnership Interests or alternative economic interests to SMBC, or its affiliates, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 12.6, nothing shall prevent SMBC, or its affiliates, from seeking a noncontrol determination from the staff of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System with respect to any action that would otherwise be prohibited by this Section 12.6, and, after receiving a noncontrol determination, taking such action, including acquiring additional Partnership Interests.   ARTICLE XIII.   REGISTRATION RIGHTS.   13.1 Registration.   (a)   (i) Following the IPO and the termination of the Strategic Alliance, SMBC shall have the right to demand that Moelis Holdings register the sale of all, but not less than all, of the Registrable Securities held by SMBC and its affiliates (together the \"SMBC Unit-Holders\") under the Securities Act (the \"Demand Notice\"), provided, however, SMBC shall not be permitted to deliver the Demand Notice within (i) 180 days of the IPO or (ii) 60 days of any public offering and sale of Partnership Interests (and/or any securities of Moelis Holdings or any successor entity into which Partnership Interests are converted, exchanged or redesignated) for cash pursuant to an effective registration statement (other than on Form S-4 or S-8 or a comparable form), and subject to the terms of any agreement entered into by Moelis Holdings, SMBC or Nikko pursuant to Section 13.7. Within 60 days after Moelis Holdings receives a written notice to register the Registrable Securities, Moelis Holdings will   18\n\n\n\n\n\n  file a Registration Statement, on an appropriate form, to register the sale of the Registrable Securities, which Registration Statement will (if specified in the SMBC Unit-Holders' notice) contemplate the ability of the SMBC Unit-Holders to effect an Underwritten Offering (the \"Demand Registration\"). The Demand Notice shall specify the intended method of distribution of the Registrable Securities. Subject to Section 13.2, Moelis Holdings may include in any registration effected pursuant to this Section 13.1 any securities for its own account or for the account of holders (other than the SMBC Unit-Holders) of Partnership Interests; provided, that, Moelis Holdings shall pay a portion of all expenses of Moelis Holdings (including those set forth in Section 13.8) in connection with any such registration, in proportion to the aggregate selling price of all securities so included in any such registration.   (ii) Moelis Holdings will use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to cause any Registration Statement to be declared effective (unless it becomes effective automatically upon filing) as promptly as practicable after the filing thereof with the SEC and (ii) to keep such Registration Statement current and effective for a period of 90 days, or such shorter time necessary for the completion of the sale of Registrable Securities registered thereon. Moelis Holdings further agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to supplement or make amendments to such Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective for the period referred to in clause (ii) above, including (A) to respond to the comments of the SEC, if any, (B) as may be required by the registration form utilized by Moelis Holdings for such Registration Statement or by the instructions to such registration form, (C) as may be required by the Securities Act, or (D) as may reasonably be requested in writing by the SMBC Unit-Holders or any underwriter and acceptable to Moelis Holdings. Moelis Holdings agrees to furnish to the SMBC Unit-Holders copies of any such supplement or amendment no later than the time it is first used or filed with the SEC.   (b) If the Demand Notice specifies that the Registrable Securities will be sold in an Underwritten Offering, the parties shall mutually agree on the lead underwriter and any additional underwriters.   (c) Any registration initiated pursuant to Section 13.1(a) shall not count as a Demand Registration (i) unless and until the Registration Statement with respect to the Registrable Securities has become effective and remained effective for a period of 90 days or, if a shorter time, until all of the Registrable Securities have been sold, or (ii) if the conditions to closing specified in the underwriting agreement, if any, entered into in connection with such registration are not satisfied or waived, other than by reason of a failure on the part of the SMBC Unit-Holders.   13.2 Piggyback Registration. If Moelis Holdings proposes to file a registration statement under the Securities Act (other than non- participating, non-convertible debt or   19\n\n\n\n\n\n  equity securities or securities to be issued pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-4 or S-8 or any comparable form) for its own account or for the account of a holder (other than the SMBC Unit-Holders) of Partnership Interests, including in connection with the IPO and where SMB C/Nikko (including an SMBC Unit-Holder) has the right to sell any or all SMBC Units under this Agreement, then Moelis Holdings shall give written notice of such proposed filing to the SMBC Unit-Holders as soon as commercially practicable but in no event less than (i) 20 days before the anticipated filing date or (ii) if Moelis Holdings determines to conduct a registration less than 20 days before the anticipated filing date, then on the date Moelis Holdings determines to proceed with such registration (a \"Piggyback Registration\"). If Moelis Holdings proposes to file the registration statement before the termination of the Strategic Alliance, the written notice to the SMBC Unit-Holders shall include the number of Partnership Interests to be sold by KM and the percentage of the total Partnership Interests held by KM represented by that number. Within 10 days after delivery of any such notice by Moelis Holdings, or such shorter period as Moelis Holdings specifies in such notice if Moelis Holdings determines to conduct a registration less than 10 days before the anticipated filing date, the SMBC Unit-Holders may request in writing that Moelis Holdings include any Registrable Securities held by the SMBC Unit-Holders in the proposed registration. The request by the SMBC Unit-Holders shall specify the number of Registrable Securities proposed to be included in the registration. Moelis Holdings will then, subject to Section 13.3, include such requested Registrable Securities in the proposed registration; provided, however, that if Moelis Holdings proposes to file the registration statement before the termination of the Strategic Alliance, the percentage of all Registrable Securities that may be included in the proposed registration may not exceed the percentage of KM's total Partnership Interests to be sold in the proposed registration, as stated in the notice by Moelis Holdings. The SMBC Unit-Holders may not withdraw any request for a Piggyback Registration involving an Underwritten Offering after the preliminary prospectuses for the proposed offering have been printed, or any \"road show\" has begun, or Moelis Holdings has made any public announcement with the consent of the SMBC Unit-Holders that assumes the participation of the SMBC Unit-Holders in the proposed offering, or in any event less than 24 hours before the pricing of such offering. The SMBC Unit-Holders shall have no right to select the underwriters in an Underwritten Offering in connection with a Piggyback Registration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 13.2, Moelis Holdings may, at any time at its sole option, choose not to proceed with the proposed registration that gives rise to the Piggyback Registration.   13.3 Reduction of Size of Underwritten Offering. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if the lead underwriter or underwriters in an Underwritten Offering pursuant to Section 13.1 or Section 13.2 advise Moelis Holdings that, in their good faith judgment, the number of Partnership Interests (including any Registrable Securities) that Moelis Holdings, the SMBC Unit-Holders and any other persons intend to include in any Registration Statement exceeds the number that can be sold in the offering in light of marketing factors or because the sale of a greater number would adversely affect the price of the Partnership Interests to be sold, then the number of Partnership Interests to be included in the Registration Statement for the account of Moelis Holdings, the SMBC Unit-Holders and any other persons will be reduced to the   20\n\n\n\n\n\n  extent necessary to reduce the total number of securities to be included in any such Registration Statement to the number recommended by the lead underwriter or underwriters, in accordance with the following priorities:   (a) in the case of a Demand Registration pursuant to Section 13.1, priority will be (i) first, all Registrable Securities included in the Registration Statement, (ii) second, any Partnership Interests proposed to be offered by Moelis Holdings for its own account (iii) third, pro rata among any other holders of Partnership Interests requested to be registered pursuant to a contractual right, and (iv) fourth, pro rata among any other holders of Partnership Interests requested to be registered;   (b) in the case of a registration statement initiated by Moelis Holdings for its own account that gives rise to a Piggyback Registration pursuant to Section 13.2, priority will be (i) first, Partnership Interests proposed to be offered by Moelis Holdings for its own account, (ii) second, pro rata among all holders of Partnership Interests requested to be registered pursuant to a contractual right and (iii) third, pro rata among any other holders of Partnership Interests requested to be registered; and   (c) in the case of a registration statement initiated by Moelis Holdings for the account of holders (other than the SMBC Unit- Holders) of Partnership Interests, pursuant to registration rights afforded to such holders by contract, that gives rise to a Piggyback Registration pursuant to Section 13.2, priority will be (i) first, pro rata among the holders of Partnership Interests for whose account the registration statement was initiated, (ii) second, Partnership Interests offered by Moelis Holdings for its own account, (iii) third, pro rata among any other holders of Partnership Interests requested to be registered pursuant to a contractual right and (iv) fourth, pro rata among any other holders of Partnership Interests requested to be registered.   13.4 Registration Procedures. Subject to the provisions of Section 13.1 or Section 13.2, in connection with the registration of the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Demand Registration or a Piggyback Registration hereunder, Moelis Holdings will:   (a) furnish to the SMBC Unit-Holders without charge, no later than the time of filing of a Registration Statement, copies of such Registration Statement, and thereafter such number of copies of such Registration Statement, each amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits thereto, including each preliminary prospectus), copies of any and all transmittal letters or other correspondence with the SEC relating to such Registration Statement and such other documents in such quantities as the SMBC Unit-Holders may reasonably request from time to time, for as long as Moelis Holdings is required to cause the Registration Statement to remain current, in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities;   (b) provide the SMBC Unit-Holders and their Representatives with the opportunity to participate in the preparation of the Registration Statement and the related Prospectus;   21\n\n\n\n\n\n  (c) use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the Partnership Interests being sold under such other securities or \"blue sky\" laws of such jurisdictions as the SMBC Unit-Holders reasonably request and do any and all other acts and things as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable the SMBC Unit-Holders to consummate the disposition of the Registrable Securities in such jurisdictions; provided, however, that Moelis Holdings shall in no event be required to (w) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified, (x) subject itself to taxation in any jurisdiction where it is not otherwise then so subject, (y) take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits other than those arising out of the offer and sale of the securities covered by the Registration Statement or (z) consent to general service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not then so subject;   (d) notify the SMBC Unit-Holders and the lead underwriter or underwriters, if any, at any time when a Prospectus relating to Registrable Securities is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of the occurrence of any event as a result of which the Registration Statement, the Prospectus included in a Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto relating to Registrable Securities contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and Moelis Holdings will use its commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the SEC a supplement or amendment to such Prospectus and Registration Statement (and comply fully with the applicable provisions of Rules 424, 430A and 430B under the Securities Act in a timely manner) so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the Registrable Securities, such Prospectus and Registration Statement will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;   (e) advise the lead underwriter or underwriters, if any, and the SMBC Unit-Holders promptly and, if requested by such persons, confirm such advice in writing, of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement under the Securities Act or of the suspension by any state securities commission of the qualification of the Registrable Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation of any proceeding for any of the preceding purposes. If at any time the SEC issues any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, or any state securities commission or other regulatory authority issues an order suspending the qualification or exemption from qualification of the Registrable Securities under state securities or \"blue sky\" laws, Moelis Holdings shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal or lifting of such order as promptly as practicable;   (f) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registrable Securities to be registered with or approved by such other governmental authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of Moelis Holdings to enable the SMBC Unit-Holders to consummate the disposition of the Registrable Securities; provided, however, that Moelis Holdings shall in no event be required to (w) qualify   22\n\n\n\n\n\n  generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified, (x) subject itself to taxation in any jurisdiction where it is not otherwise then so subject, (y) take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits other than those arising out of the offer and sale of the securities covered by the Registration Statement or (z) consent to general service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not then so subject;   (g) if requested by the SMBC Unit-Holders or the underwriter or underwriters, if any, promptly include in any Registration Statement or Prospectus, pursuant to a supplement or post-effective amendment if necessary, such information as the SMBC Unit-Holders and the underwriter or underwriters, if any, may reasonably request to have included therein, including information relating to the \"Plan of Distribution\" of the Registrable Securities, information about the number of Registrable Securities being sold to the underwriter or underwriters, the purchase price being paid therefor and any other terms of the offering of the Registrable Securities to be sold in such offering, and make all required filings of such Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment as soon as practicable after Moelis Holdings is notified of the matters to be included in such Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment;   (h) for the period beginning a reasonable time before the filing of the Registration Statement and for as long as Moelis Holdings is required to cause the Registration Statement to remain current under Section 13.1(a)(ii), and except to the extent prohibited by applicable law and subject to entering into customary confidentiality agreements, after reasonable advance notice, make available for inspection by the SMBC Unit- Holders, any underwriter participating in any disposition of the Registrable Securities, and any Representative for the SMBC Unit-Holders or such underwriter, during business hours and at the location designated by Moelis Holdings, any financial and other records and corporate documents of Moelis Holdings as will be reasonably necessary to enable them to conduct reasonable and customary due diligence with respect to Moelis Holdings and the related Registration Statement and Prospectus, provided, however, that records, documents and information obtained hereunder will be used by such inspecting person only to conduct such due diligence; and   (i) together with any other holder of Partnership Interests proposing to include securities in any Underwritten Offering, enter into a reasonable and customary written agreement with the underwriter or underwriters, if any, in such form and containing such provisions as are reasonable and customary in the securities business for such an arrangement between underwriters and companies of Moelis Holding's size and investment stature.   13.5 Conditions to Offerings. The obligations of Moelis Holdings to take the actions contemplated by Sections 13.1, 13.2 and 13.4 with respect to an offering of Registrable Securities will be subject to the following conditions:   (a) Moelis Holdings may require each SMBC Unit-Holder to furnish to Moelis Holdings such information regarding such SMBC Unit-Holder, the Registrable Securities or the distribution of such Registrable Securities as Moelis Holdings may from time to time request, in each case to the extent reasonably required by the Securities Act   23\n\n\n\n\n\n  and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or under state securities or \"blue sky\" laws; and   (b) If an offering of Registrable Securities is an Underwritten Offering, each SMBC Unit-Holder must: (A) agree to sell its Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting agreement approved by Moelis Holdings in accordance with Section 13.4(i), (B) complete and execute, as applicable, all customary questionnaires, powers of attorney, underwriting agreements, lock-up agreements consistent with Section 13.7 and other documents customarily required under the terms of such underwriting agreement and (iii) agree to make customary representations and warranties (including as to due organization and good standing, corporate power and authority, due approval, no conflicts and ownership and transfer of Registrable Securities, and as to accuracy and completeness of those statements made in the applicable Registration Statement, Prospectus or other document in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to Moelis Holdings or the underwriter or underwriters by such SMBC Unit-Holder) and covenants in such underwriting agreement.   13.6 Suspension Period.   (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Moelis Holdings shall be entitled, by providing prior written notice to the SMBC Unit-Holders, to postpone the filing or effectiveness or suspend the use of any Registration Statement pursuant to Section 13.1 for a reasonable period of time not to exceed 60 days in succession or 120 days in any 365-day period (or a longer period of time with the prior written consent of SMBC, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) (a \"Suspension Period\") if (A) Moelis Holdings determines in good faith that effecting the registration (or permitting sales under an effective registration) would reasonably be expected to adversely affect an offering of securities of Moelis Holdings, (B) Moelis Holdings is in possession of material non-public information and deems it advisable not to disclose such information in a Registration Statement, or (C) due to a pending or contemplated financing, acquisition, disposition, corporate reorganization, merger, public offering of securities or other similar transaction or other material event or circumstance involving Moelis Holdings or its securities. Moelis Holdings will notify the SMBC Unit-Holders promptly upon the termination of the Suspension Period. Upon notice by Moelis Holdings to the SMBC Unit-Holders of any determination to commence a Suspension Period, the SMBC Unit-Holders shall, except as required by applicable law, including any disclosure obligations under Section 13 of the Exchange Act, keep the fact of any such Suspension Period strictly confidential, and during any Suspension Period, promptly halt any offer, sale (including sales pursuant to Rule 144), trading or transfer of any Partnership Interests for the duration of the Suspension Period until Moelis Holdings has provided notice that the Suspension Period has been terminated.   (b) If Moelis Holdings suspends the use of a Registration Statement pursuant to Section 13.6(a), the holders of Registrable Securities shall receive an extension of the registration period under Section 13.1(a)(ii) and 13.1(c) equal to the number of days of the suspension.   24\n\n\n\n\n\n  (c) The SMBC Unit-Holders agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from Moelis Holdings of the occurrence of any event of the kind described in Section 13.4(d) or Section 13.4(e) or a condition described in Section 13.6(a), each SMBC Unit-Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement covering the sale of Registrable Securities until the SMBC Unit-Holders receive copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 13.4(d) or Section 13.6(d) or notice from Moelis Holdings of the termination of the stop order or Suspension Period.   (d) After the expiration of any Suspension Period and without any further request from a holder of Partnership Interests, Moelis Holdings shall use its commercially reasonably efforts to prepare a Registration Statement, or post-effective amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference, or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of the Registrable Securities included therein, the Prospectus will not include a material misstatement or omission or be not effective and useable for the sale of Registrable Securities.   13.7 Market Stand-Off Agreement.   (a) In connection with any Underwritten Offering that is the IPO, or any Underwritten Offering in which the SMBC Unit-Holders are selling Registrable Securities pursuant to Sections 13.1 or 13.2, each SMBC Unit-Holder agrees that, during the period of duration (up to 180 days, subject to customary extensions as may be required by the underwriter or underwriters up to a maximum of 214 days) specified by Moelis Holdings and the underwriter or underwriters of Registrable Securities, following the date of the final prospectus or other offering document distributed in connection with the Underwritten Offering, it shall not, to the extent requested by Moelis Holdings and such underwriter or underwriters, directly or indirectly, sell, offer to sell, contract to sell (including any short sale or other hedging transaction), grant any option to purchase or otherwise transfer any Registrable Securities held by it at any time during such period except for such Registrable Securities as shall be included in such registration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations described in this Section 13.7(a) shall not apply (i) to a registration relating solely to employee benefit plans on Form S-1 or Form S-8, (ii) to a registration relating solely to an acquisition or similar transaction on Form S-4 or (iii) unless all holders then holding more than 3% of the issued and outstanding Partnership Interests (and/or any securities of Moelis Holdings or any successor entity into which the Partnership Interests are converted, exchanged or redesignated) with a contractual obligation enforceable by Moelis Holdings or its affiliates to do so and all of the then-current executive officers and directors (if applicable) of Moelis Holdings enter into similar agreements.   (b) In order to enforce the foregoing covenant, Moelis Holdings may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the Registrable Securities of each SMBC Unit-Holder until the end of such period.   25\n\n\n\n\n\n  13.8 Registration Expenses. All fees and expenses incident to Moelis Holding's performance of or compliance with the obligations of this ARTICLE XIII, including all fees and expenses incurred in complying with securities or \"blue sky\" laws, printing expenses, messenger and delivery expenses of Moelis Holdings, any registration or filing fees payable under any federal or state securities or \"blue sky\" laws, the fees and expenses incurred in connection with any listing or quoting of the securities to be registered on any national securities exchange or automated quotation system, fees of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, fees and disbursements of counsel for Moelis Holdings, its independent registered certified public accounting firm and any other public accountants who are required to deliver comfort letters (including the expenses required by or incident to such performance), fees of transfer agents and registrars, costs of insurance, and the fees and expenses of other persons retained by Moelis Holdings, will be borne by Moelis Holdings; provided, however; that the SMBC Unit-Holders shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of Moelis Holdings (including, for the avoidance of doubt, all the fees set forth above in this section) in connection with the Demand Registration subject to Moelis Holdings' obligations set forth in Section 13.1(a)(i). The SMBC Unit-Holders will bear and pay any fees and expenses of SMBC or its affiliates or their Representatives, including their counsel, and any underwriting discounts, fees and commissions and any transfer taxes applicable to Registrable Securities offered for its account pursuant to any Registration Statement.   13.9 Indemnification; Contribution.   (a) In connection with any registration of Registrable Securities, Moelis Holdings will indemnify, defend and hold harmless each SMBC Unit-Holder, its affiliates, directors, officers and SMBC Unit-Holders and each person who controls SMBC Unit-Holder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act (collectively, the \"Indemnified Persons\") from and against any and all direct losses, claims, damages, liabilities, obligations, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, as a result of any notices, actions, suits, proceedings, claims, demands, assessments, judgments, awards, costs, penalties, taxes and reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys' and other professionals' fees and disbursements, but excluding any consequential damages) (collectively \"Losses\") caused by (i) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any part of any Registration Statement or any Prospectus, including any amendment or supplement thereto, used in connection with the Registrable Securities or any Issuer FWP or (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading; provided, however, that Moelis Holdings will not be required to indemnify any Indemnified Person for any Losses resulting from any such untrue statement or omission if such untrue statement or omission was made in reliance on and in conformity with information with respect to any Indemnified Person furnished to Moelis Holdings in writing by, or on behalf of, any of the SMBC Unit-Holders expressly for use therein.   (b) In connection with any Registration Statement, Prospectus or Issuer FWP, each SMBC Unit-Holder, jointly and severally, will indemnify, defend and   26\n\n  hold harmless Moelis Holdings, its directors, its officers and each person, if any, who controls Moelis Holdings (within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from Moelis Holdings to each SMBC Unit-Holder, but only with respect to information furnished to Moelis Holdings in writing by, or on behalf of, any SMBC Unit-Holder or any Indemnified Persons expressly for use in such Registration Statement, Prospectus or Issuer FWP; and provided, further, however, that in no event shall the liability for indemnity of any SMBC Unit-Holder under this Section 13.9(b) exceed the dollar amount of the proceeds (net of any underwriting discount or commission or other selling expenses) received by such SMBC Unit-Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification.   (c) In case any claim, action or proceeding (including any governmental investigation) is instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 13.9(a) or 13.9(b), such person (the \"Indemnified Party\") will promptly, but in any event within 10 Business Days, notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the \"Indemnifying Party\") in writing, and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, and to the extent the Indemnifying Party so desires, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided, that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice within the time limit provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Section 13.9(a) or 13.9(b), except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice. In any such claim, action or proceeding where the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in any such defense and to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel will be at the expense of such Indemnified Party unless the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party have been advised by counsel that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicting interests between them. It is understood that the Indemnifying Party will not, in connection with any claim, action or proceeding or related claims, actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any time for all such Indemnified Parties and that all such reasonable fees and expenses will be reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case of the retention of any such separate firm for the Indemnified Parties, such firm will be designated in writing by the Indemnified Parties. No Indemnified Party will, without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is seeking indemnity hereunder. The Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any settlement of any claim, action or proceeding effected without its written consent, but if such claim, action or proceeding is settled with such consent or if there has been a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Party agrees to indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against any Loss by reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Party will, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is seeking indemnity hereunder, unless such settlement includes (i) an   27\n\n\n\n\n\n  unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability in connection with such proceeding, (ii) no finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of any person by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates can be made as the result of such action, and (iii) the sole relief (if any) provided is monetary damages that are reimbursed in full by the Indemnifying Party.   (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 13.9 from the Indemnifying Party is unavailable to an Indemnified Party hereunder or is insufficient in respect of any Losses referred to in this Section 13.9, then the Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, will contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such Losses (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the actions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative fault referred to in clause (i) but also the relative benefit of Moelis Holdings, on the one hand, and each SMBC Unit-Holder, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided, however, that in no event shall a SMBC Unit-Holder be required by this Section 13.9(d) to contribute an aggregate amount in excess of the dollar amount of proceeds (net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other selling expenses) received by such SMBC Unit-Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities giving rise to such contribution. The relative fault of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been taken by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the Losses referred to above will be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 13.9(c), any reasonable out of pocket legal or other out of pocket fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding.   (e) The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to Section 13.9(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in Section 13.9(d). No person guilty of \"fraudulent misrepresentation\" (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 13.9(e), a SMBC Unit-Holder shall not be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by such SMBC Unit-Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities exceeds the amount of any damages which such SMBC Unit-Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.   28\n\n\n\n\n\n  (f) If indemnification is available under this Section 13.9, the Indemnifying Party will indemnify each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law provided in Sections 13.9(a) and 13.9(b) without regard to the relative fault of said Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party or any other equitable consideration provided for in Section 13.9(d) or 13.9(e). The obligations of Moelis Holdings under this Section 13.9 shall be in addition to any liability that Moelis Holdings may otherwise have to any Indemnified Person.   (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of the Indemnified Parties has relied on this Section 13.9, is an express third party beneficiary of this Section 13.9 and is entitled to enforce the obligations of the applicable Indemnified Parties under this Section 13.9 directly against such Indemnified Parties to the full extent thereof.   13.10 Rule 144. For so long as Moelis Holdings is subject to the requirements of Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Act, Moelis Holdings agrees that it will use its reasonable best efforts to (i) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 and (ii) file the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.   13.11 Transfer of Registration Rights. The rights to cause Moelis Holdings to register securities granted to the SMBC Unit-Holders under this ARTICLE XIII may be assigned by the SMBC Unit-Holders with the consent of Moelis Holdings, except that the SMBC Unit-Holders may assign such rights to their Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries without the consent of Moelis Holdings.   13.12 Termination of Registration Rights. The registration rights contained in Section 13.1 shall automatically terminate when the SMBC Unit-Holders collectively hold Registrable Securities in an amount less than (i) 1% of the issued and outstanding Partnership Interests (and/or any securities of Moelis Holdings or any successor entity into which the Partnership Interests are converted, exchanged or redesignated) and (ii) the average weekly reported volume of trading in Partnership Interests (and/or any securities of Moelis Holdings or any successor entity into which the SMBC Units are converted, exchanged or redesignated) on all national securities exchanges and/or reported through the automated quotation system of a registered securities association for the four calendar weeks preceding the date on which such determination is made.

Each of the Moelis Entities has all requisite corporate or other entity power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, other than any failure to be so licensed or qualified that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Moelis Entities and their controlled affiliates, taken as a whole.   (b) Moelis Holdings Agreement. The Moelis Holdings Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by Moelis General Partner and is a valid and legally binding agreement of Moelis General Partner, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except (i) as the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar applicable laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (ii) that the remedies of specific performance, injunction and other forms of equitable relief may not be available because they are subject to certain tests of equity jurisdiction, equitable defenses and the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought. The Moelis Holdings Agreement attached as Tab 5 of the Subscription Agreement is a true, correct and complete copy of the Moelis Holdings Agreement as currently in effect.   (c) Affiliates. Each controlled affiliate of Moelis Holdings is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation and has all requisite corporate or other entity power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, other than any failure to be in good standing or to be so licensed or qualified that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Moelis Entities and their controlled affiliates, taken as a whole. All the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other partnership, equity or ownership interests of such controlled affiliates have been duly authorized and validly\n\n\n\n\n\nissued, are fully paid and nonassessable with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof (except as provided for in the governing documents of such controlled affiliate), have been issued in compliance with all applicable securities laws, and were not issued in violation of any preemptive rights or other right to subscribe for or purchase securities. Except as set\n\n\n\n\n\n  forth in the Moelis Disclosure Schedule, Moelis Holdings owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of each of its controlled affiliates, free and clear of all liens or encumbrances.   (d) Capitalization. (1) The Moelis Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of the number, class and series of each issued and outstanding class and series of Partnership Interests as of the date of this Agreement. (2) All of the issued and outstanding Partnership Interests have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, and have been issued in compliance with all applicable securities laws, and were not issued in violation of any preemptive rights or other rights to subscribe for or purchase securities. (3) Except with respect to employees of Moelis Holdings or its controlled affiliates and except as set forth in the Moelis Holdings Agreement, none of Moelis Holdings or any of its controlled affiliates has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of, or securities or options, warrants or rights convertible or exercisable into or exchangeable for, any Partnership Interests or other equity or synthetic ownership interests of Moelis Holdings or any controlled affiliate, or any securities representing or contractual right granting the right (i) to purchase or otherwise receive any equity interest in Moelis Holdings or any controlled affiliate (including any rights plan or agreement) or (ii) to receive any periodic or other distribution on net income or net loss or upon the liquidation and winding up of Moelis Holdings or any controlled affiliate. (4) (a) Except as set forth in the Moelis Disclosure Schedule, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no, written or oral, side letter, contract, memorandum of understanding and any other agreements entered into between any of Moelis Entities on one hand and any Limited Partner of Moelis Holdings on the other hand in respect to of the issuance or holding of any class or type of interest in Moelis Holdings, regardless of whether such side letter, written contract, memorandum of understanding and any other agreements are entered into by such Limited Partner in its capacity as such, except for any vesting agreements, employment agreements, offer letters or similar agreements entered into between the Moelis Entities and employees of Moelis Holdings or its controlled affiliates; and (b) as of the date of this Agreement, no preferential voting or economic right granted to any Limited Partner of Moelis Holdings pursuant to any Representation (d) Transaction Agreements (as defined in the Moelis Disclosure Schedule) would reasonably be expected to significantly and adversely affect any voting or economic right of the SMBC Unit-Holders under the Moelis Holdings Agreement, the Subscription Agreement, the Side Letter or this Agreement (as applicable), other than as a result of dilution in accordance with the Moelis Holdings Agreement from the issuance of additional Management Units pursuant to such Representation (d) Transaction Agreements. (5) The Moelis Disclosure Schedule sets forth a schedule of SMBC's pro forma ownership of Moelis Holdings, as of the date of this Agreement, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by the Subscription Agreement and the methodology for calculating such pro forma ownership as described in such schedule.   (e) Partnership Interests. The issuance of Partnership Interests to SMBC pursuant to the Subscription Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of Moelis Holdings. When issued, delivered and sold against receipt of   A-2\n\n\n\n\n\n  the consideration therefor as provided in the Subscription Agreement, such Partnership Interests will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and without any personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof (except as provided for in the Moelis Holdings Agreement), will not be issued in violation of or subject to preemptive rights of any other unitholder of Moelis Holdings and will not result in the violation or triggering of any price-based antidilution adjustments under any agreement to which Moelis Holdings is a party. The issuance of Partnership Interests to SMBC qualifies as an issuance of \"Additional Units\" to a \"Strategic Investor\" under Section 3.4.1 of the Moelis Holdings Agreement for which existing Common Partners will not have the right of first refusal as provided therein.   (f) No Conflicts. Neither the execution and delivery by the Moelis Entities of the Strategic Alliance Agreement or the Subscription Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, nor compliance by the Moelis Entities with any of the provisions thereof, will violate any applicable law or regulation or violate, conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the termination of, or result in the loss of any benefit or creation of any right on the part of any third party under, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in a right of termination or acceleration of, or result in the creation of any lien or encumbrance upon any of the material properties or assets of any of the Moelis Entities or any of their controlled affiliates under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of (i) their respective organizational documents or (ii) any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which any of the Moelis Entities or any of their controlled affiliates is a party or by which it may be bound, or to which any of the Moelis Entities or any of their controlled affiliates or any of the properties or assets of any of the Moelis Entities or any of their controlled affiliates may be subject, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Moelis Entities and their controlled affiliates, taken as a whole.

Consideration to AJR; Registration Rights.\n\n          (a) In  consideration of the rights granted to XC pursuant to Sections 1 and 2 hereof and the provisions of this  Agreement,  XC shall issue to AJR (i) 125,000  shares  (the  \"Shares\")  of common  stock,  par value  $0.01 of XC (the \"Common  Stock\");  and (ii)  warrants to purchase  50,000 shares of Common Stock (the  \"Warrants\").  The Warrants shall have an exercise price of $1.18 per share being the closing  market price for the Common Stock on April 30, 2002 and shall be exercisable for a period of three (3) years from their date of issue.\n\n          (b) In  addition  to the  Shares  and  Warrants  to be  issued  to AJR pursuant to Section 3(a)  hereof,  XC agrees to provide to AJR five (5) to eight (8) (as  determined by XC in its  discretion)  MAV(R)  wearable  computers  (the \"Units\") to be used by AJR to promote XC's products and services as contemplated by Section 1(c)(v). AJR shall have no liability for any damage to or loss of the wearable computers issued to AJR under this Agreement, except to the extent such damage  or loss  results  from the  intentional  abuse of the  equipment  by AJR personnel.\n\n          (c) XC shall provide a link from its website to AJR's website.\n\n          (d) XC  hereby  grants to AJR  \"piggyback\"  registration  rights  with respect to the Shares and the shares of Common  Stock  underlying  the  Warrants (collectively,  the  \"Registrable  Securities\").  Pursuant  to such  \"piggyback\" registration  rights, XC shall include all of the Registrable  Securities in any registration  statement filed by XC with respect to its Common Stock (other than on a  registration  statement  on Forms  S-8 or S-4 (or any  successors  to such forms) or relating to any employee  stock option plan) with the  Securities  and Exchange Commission.  In the event a registration  statement covering all of the Registrable  Securities  has\n\n                                      -3-\n\nnot been filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission on or before July 1, 2002, XC agrees to pay to AJR $10,000. XC shall pay to AJR an additional $10,000 for each thirty-day  period  thereafter  (e.g.,  ending,  August 1, September 1, etc.) in which a  registration  statement has not been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for purposes of registering all Registrable  Securities. All such  payments  due  hereunder  shall be payable on or before the 5th of the month in which such payment  becomes due. In the event XC voluntarily  withdraws any registration  statement submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission, XC shall be deemed to have  never  submitted  such  registration  statement  for purposes of this paragraph.  Unless  otherwise agreed by XC and AJR, none of the\n\n\n\n\n\nRegistrable  Securities shall be sold as part of an underwritten public offering in connection with the registration  statement filed pursuant to this paragraph, but, instead, shall be delivered to AJR as unrestricted, freely trading Shares.\n\n          (e) All costs and expenses  associated  with the  registration  of the Registrable  Securities  shall be born by  XC.AJR  shall  provide  XC with  such information  regarding AJR as XC shall request for inclusion in the registration statement  and shall  indemnify the Company and hold it harmless with respect to any material misstatement or material omission with respect to such information\n\n          (f) All Registrable Securities that are registered pursuant to Section 3(d) hereof shall be subject to the \"lock-up\"  provided for in this Section 3(f) (the  \"Lock-Up\"),  and AJR agrees to be bound by the  Lock-Up.  Pursuant  to the Lock-Up,  AJR agrees that following the registration of Registrable  Securities, it shall not directly or  indirectly,  sell,  transfer,  pledge,  assign,  gift, hypothecate  or  otherwise  dispose of more than 25,000  shares of Common  Stock during  any  five  (5)  consecutive  trading  days on the  principal  securities exchange or securities market where XC's Common Stock is then traded.\n\n     4. Accredited Investor Representations.  In order to induce XC to issue the Shares and the  Warrants to AJR,  AJR hereby  represents  and  warrants to XC as follows:\n\n          (a) AJR is aware of what constitutes an \"accredited  investor\" as that term is defined under Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  \"Securities  Act\"), and under applicable state securities laws, and AJR represents and warrants that is an \"accredited investor\" for purposes of Regulation D and such state securities laws.\n\n          (b) AJR acknowledges that an investment in the Shares and the Warrants is a  speculative  investment  and  involves a high degree of risk,  and that XC makes no assurances  whatsoever  concerning the present or prospective  value of the  Shares  or the  Warrants.  AJR is able to bear  the  economic  risks  of an investment in the Shares and the Warrants,  and, consequently,  without limiting the generality of the foregoing, is able to hold the Shares and the Warrants for an indefinite period of time and has a sufficient net worth to sustain a loss of its entire  investment  in the Shares and the  Warrants in the event such a loss should occur.\n\n          (c) AJR has had an opportunity to review copies of XC's public filings with  the  United  States   Securities  and  Exchange   Commission  (the  \"SEC\") (collectively,  the \"Public  Documents\").  AJR has had the opportunity to obtain any additional  information  necessary to verify the accuracy of the information contained in the Public  Documents  and has been given the  opportunity  to meet with representatives of XC and to have them answer any questions and\n\n                                      -4-\n\nprovide any  additional  information  considered  relevant by AJR. In making its decision  to invest in Shares and the  Warrants,  AJR has  relied  solely on the Public Documents.\n\n          (d) AJR is acquiring the Shares and the Warrants for AJR's own account for  investment  and not with a view to or for  resale  in  connection  with any distribution  of the  Shares or the  Warrants.  AJR has not  offered or sold any portion of the Shares or the Warrants  and has no present  intention of dividing the Shares or the Warrants with others or of selling,  distributing or otherwise disposing of any portion of the Shares or the Warrants either currently or after the passage of a fixed or determinable  period of time or upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of any predetermined event or circumstance.  AJR is acquiring the Shares and the Warrants for AJR's own account for investment and not with a view to or for  resale  in  connection  with any  distribution  of the  Shares or the Warrants.  AJR has not offered or sold any portion of the Shares or the Warrants and has no present  intention of dividing the Shares or the Warrants with others or of selling,  distributing or otherwise disposing of any portion of the Shares or the Warrants either currently or after the passage of a fixed or determinable period of time or upon the  occurrence or  non-occurrence  of any  predetermined event or  circumstance.

AJR and XC each agrees that it shall keep the  Confidential  Information it receives from the other party hereto strictly  confidential and shall not disclose any of the Confidential  Information to any other person or entity,  or take or use any of the Confidential Information for its own purposes,  except as may be required in connection with the  performance of its  obligations  under this Agreement or the enforcement of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  a party may disclose the  Confidential  Information  of the other party hereto:  (i) if such Confidential  Information  becomes  generally  known or available to the public, other  than  due to a  breach  of this  Agreement  by the  party  receiving  the Confidential  Information hereunder;  (ii) in connection with the enforcement of this  Agreement;  (iii) pursuant to applicable law,  regulation or subpoena;  or (iv) if such Confidential  Information was disclosed to either AJR or XC, as the case may be,  by a source  that was not  bound,  to the  knowledge  of the party receiving the Confidential Information,  to a confidentiality obligation for the benefit of, or fiduciary  relationship  in favor of, the other party hereto.

If CARDAX, Affiliates or their respective employees, servants or agents, or CAPSUGEL, its Affiliates or their respective employees, servants or agents (in each case an \"Indemnified Party\"), receive any written claim which such Indemnified Party believes is the subject of indemnity hereunder by the other Party hereto (an \"Indemnifying Party\"), the Indemnified Party shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after forming such belief, give notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party, provided that the failure to give timely notice to the Indemnifying Party as contemplated hereby shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any liability to the Indemnified Party unless the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the defense of such claim is prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, by prompt notice to the Indemnified Party to assume the defense of such claim at its cost, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not so assume the defense of such claim or, having done so, does not diligently pursue such defense, the Indemnified Party may assume the defense, with counsel of its choice, but at the cost of the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party so assumes the defense, it shall have absolute control of the litigation; the Indemnified Party may, nevertheless, participate therein through counsel of its choice and at its cost. The Party not assuming the defense of any such claim shall render all reasonable assistance to the Party assuming such defense, and out-of-pocket costs of such assistance shall be for the account of the Indemnifying Party. No such claim shall be settled other than by the Party defending the same, and then only with the consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided that the Indemnified Party shall have no obligation to consent to any settlement of any such claim which (i) imposes on the Indemnified Party any liability or obligation which cannot be assumed or performed in full by the Indemnifying Party, (ii) does not unconditionally release the Indemnified Party, (iii) does require a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or (iv) does impose any restrictions on the conduct of business by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates.   8.4 Limitation of Damages.  IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS ARISING UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. Except in the event of (i) a Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct and/or (ii) a Party's breach of its confidentiality obligation, the total liability of one Party to the other Party (and its Affiliates) arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Products, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), statute or otherwise, shall, to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, be limited to the amount of revenues it receives under this Agreement.   8.5 Insurance.

In any event, neither party shall be liable for any special, consequential or incidental damages. 15. Additional Representations, Warranties and Covenants.

PROSECUTION, MAINTENANCE AND ENFORCEMENT 9.1 Responsibility and Cooperation. As between the Parties, Arizona, with respect to the Arizona Licensed IP, and the Buyer Entities, with respect to the Company Licensed IP, shall have the right (but not the obligation) for filing, prosecuting, and maintaining all Arizona Licensed IP and Company Licensed IP, respectively, in the licensing Party's name. For the avoidance of doubt, in case either such Party files any new Intellectual Property registration to the extent covering the Licensed IP, such new Intellectual Property registration shall automatically become Licensed IP. However, and for the further avoidance of doubt, the aforementioned shall not apply to new Intellectual Property created by a licensee Party or its Sublicensees separately and independently from the Licensed IP, for example in case of separate and independent technical enhancements or advancements. The Parties shall reasonably consult and coordinate with each other at the other Party's request with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 9.1. 9.2 No Additional Obligations. This Agreement shall not obligate either Party to disclose to the other Party, or maintain, register, prosecute, pay for, enforce, or otherwise manage any Intellectual Property except as expressly set forth herein. 9.3 Enforcement. As between the Parties, Arizona, with respect to the Arizona Licensed IP, and the Company or Buyer, with respect to the Company Licensed IP, shall have the right (but not the obligation) to elect to bring a Proceeding or enter into settlement discussions regarding, or otherwise seek to resolve, any infringement, misappropriation, or other violation, or allegations of invalidity or unenforceability, of the Licensed IP. In the event that Arizona declines to institute any Proceedings against third-party infringers or violators of any Arizona Licensed Patents, regarding activities that would fall within the Company Field if conducted by the Company, within forty-five (45) days after being notified or becoming aware of such infringing conduct, the Company or Buyer shall have the right to institute any Proceedings against such third-party infringers or violators. In the event that the Company or Buyer elects to institute such Proceedings, Arizona will reasonably cooperate with the Company or Buyer in such Proceedings, and the Company or Buyer shall reimburse Arizona for all reasonable costs and fees incurred by Arizona as a result of such cooperation. Such cooperation by Arizona will include joining such Proceeding as a party, if deemed necessary by the Company or Buyer. In the event that Arizona elects to bring a Proceeding against any alleged infringer of the Arizona Licensed Trademarks and seeks the cooperation of the Licensor of the Trademark License Agreement in such Proceeding, Arizona will take reasonable steps to assist the Company or Buyer in requesting the cooperation of the Licensor of the Trademark License Agreement, and pursuing an infringement claim against such alleged infringer. The Company or Buyer, as applicable, shall retain all benefits, recoveries, injunctions or other value derived from such Proceedings instituted by such Party. 10.

MISCELLANEOUS 13.1 Entire Agreement.

It shall be expressly understood that the Stock Purchase Agreement shall govern the transactions contemplated thereby as a whole and that this Agreement shall not be construed as an amendment or variation of the Stock Purchase Agreement but rather shall be complemented by and interpreted in light of the Stock Purchase Agreement. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is inconsistent with, conflicts with or contradicts any term of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement will prevail. 13.2 Assignment.

Accordingly, each Party hereto also agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement by such Party, Arizona, on the one hand, and the Buyer Entities, on the other hand, shall be entitled to equitable relief without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, including in the form of injunctions and orders for specific performance. Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Arizona, on the one hand, and Buyer Entities, on the other hand, hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific 12\n\nSource: ARMSTRONG FLOORING, INC., 8-K, 1/7/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nperformance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Buyer Entities or Arizona, as applicable, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the Buyer Entities or Arizona, as applicable, under this Agreement. 13.5 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. (a) This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, its rules of conflict of laws notwithstanding. Each Party hereby agrees and consents to be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, or if the Court of Chancery lacks jurisdiction over such dispute, in any state or federal court having jurisdiction over the matter situated in New Castle County, Delaware, in any Action seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Party hereby irrevocably consents to the service of any and all process in any such Action by the delivery of such process to such Party at the address and in the manner provided in Section 13.3 hereof. Each of the Parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, or if the Court of Chancery lacks jurisdiction over such dispute, in any state or federal court having jurisdiction over the matter situated in New Castle County, Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such Proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. (b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE BREACH, TERMINATION OR VALIDITY OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 13.5(b). 13\n\nSource: ARMSTRONG FLOORING, INC., 8-K, 1/7/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n13.6 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement, or any portion thereof, is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement, or the remaining portion thereof, shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any such term or other provision, or any portion thereof, is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated to the fullest extent possible. 13.7 Counterparts.

Except as set forth below, the Adviser will pay all operating expenses of each Fund specifically assumed by the Fund under the Management Agreement between the Trust and the Adviser dated June 24, 2020 (the \"Management Agreement\"), including without limitation the compensation and expenses of any employees of the Fund and of any other persons rendering any services to the Fund; clerical and shareholder service staff salaries; office space and other office expenses; fees and expenses incurred by the Fund in connection with membership in investment company organizations; legal, auditing and accounting expenses; expenses of registering shares under federal and state securities laws, including expenses incurred by the Fund in connection with the organization and initial registration of shares of the Fund; insurance expenses; fees and expenses of the custodian, transfer agent, dividend disbursing agent, shareholder service agent, plan agent, administrator (excluding fees and expenses payable to the Adviser under this Agreement and the Management Agreement), accounting and pricing services agent and underwriter of the Fund; expenses, including clerical expenses, of issue, sale, redemption or repurchase of shares of the Fund; the cost of preparing and distributing reports and notices to shareholders, the cost of printing or preparing prospectuses and statements of additional information for delivery to shareholders; the cost of printing or preparing stock certificates or any other documents, statements or reports to shareholders; expenses of shareholders' meetings and proxy solicitations; and all other operating expenses not specifically assumed by the Fund.

The Adviser may obtain reimbursement from the Fund, at such time or times as the Adviser may determine in its sole discretion, for any expenses advanced by the Adviser that the Fund is obligated to pay, and such reimbursement shall not be considered to\n\n2\n\nbe part of the Adviser's compensation pursuant to this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Record Keeping and Other Information. The Adviser shall create and maintain all necessary records in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, records required by Section 31(a) of the Act and the rules thereunder, as the same may be amended from time to time, pertaining to the various functions performed by it and not otherwise created and maintained by another party pursuant to contract with the Trust. Where applicable, such records shall be maintained by the Adviser for the periods and in the places required by Rule 31a-2 under the Act.\n\n5. Audit, Inspection and Visitation. The Adviser shall make available to the Trust during regular business hours all records and other data created and maintained pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Agreement for reasonable audit and inspection by the Trust or any regulatory agency having authority over the Trust.\n\n6. Compensation. For the performance of the Adviser's obligations under this Agreement, including payment of certain expenses of each of the Funds pursuant to paragraph 3 hereof, each Fund shall pay the Adviser, on the first business day following the end of each month, a fee at an annual rate of 0.65% of a Fund's average daily net assets up to $25 million, 0.35% of a Fund's average daily net assets from $25 million to $100 million, and 0.25% of a Fund's average daily net assets for such assets in excess of $100 million.\n\nThe average value of the daily net assets of a Fund shall be determined pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Agreement and Declaration of Trust or a resolution of the Board of Trustees, if required. If, pursuant to such provisions, the determination of net asset value of a Fund is suspended for any particular business day, then for the purposes of this paragraph, the value of the net assets of a Fund as last determined shall be deemed to be the value of the net assets as of the close of the business day, or as of such other time as the value of the Fund's net assets may lawfully be determined, on that day. If the determination of the net asset value of a Fund has been suspended for a period including such month, the Adviser's compensation payable at the end of such month shall be computed on the basis of the value of the net assets of the Fund as last determined (whether during or prior to such month).\n\n7. Limitation of Liability. The Adviser may rely on information reasonably believed by it to be accurate and reliable. Except as may otherwise be required by the Act or the rules thereunder, neither the Adviser nor its directors, officers, employees, shareholders, agents, control persons or affiliates of any thereof (collectively, the \"Adviser Employees\") shall be subject to any liability for, or any damages, expenses or losses incurred by the Trust in connection with any error of judgment, mistake of law, any act or omission in connection with or arising out of any services rendered under or payments made pursuant to this Agreement or any other matter to which this Agreement relates, except by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the part of any such persons in the performance of the duties of the Adviser under this Agreement or by reason of reckless disregard by any of such persons of the obligations and duties of the Adviser under this Agreement. Any person, even though also a director, officer, employee, shareholder or agent of the Adviser, who may be or become a trustee, officer, employee or agent of the Trust, shall be deemed, when rendering services to the Trust or\n\n3\n\nacting on any business of the Trust (other than services or business in connection with the Adviser's duties hereunder), to be rendering such services to or acting solely for the Trust and not as a director, officer, employee, shareholder or agent, or one under the control or direction of the Adviser, even though paid by it. The Adviser is responsible for any information that it provides to the Trust for inclusion in the prospectus and/or statement of additional information of the Fund. The Adviser agrees to defend and indemnify the Trust, and its trustees, officers and agent from and against any and all liability, losses, claims and damages arising from any inaccurate or incomplete statement provided by the Adviser (or its officers, employees, directors and agents) for inclusion in the Fund's prospectus or statement of additional information. The Adviser agrees to defend and indemnify the Trust, and its trustees, officers and agents from and against any and all liability, losses, claims and damages arising from your willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the Adviser's part or the part of the Adviser's officers, employees, directors and agents in the performance of the Adviser's duties under this Agreement, or by reason of reckless disregard by any of such persons of the Adviser's obligations and duties under this Agreement.\n\n8. Services for Others. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Adviser or any affiliated person of the Adviser from providing services for any other person, firm or corporation, including other investment companies; provided, however, that the Adviser expressly represents that it will undertake no activities which, in its judgment, will adversely affect the performance of its obligations to the Trust under this Agreement.\n\n9. Renewal and Termination. The term of this Services Agreement shall begin on the date of execution and shall continue in effect for a period of two years. This Services Agreement shall continue in effect from year to year thereafter, subject to termination as hereinafter provided, if such continuance is approved at least annually by vote of a majority of the Trustees who are not interested persons of the Trust or the Adviser. This Agreement may be terminated without the payment of any penalty by either party upon sixty (60) days' written notice to the other party. Upon the termination of this Agreement, the Trust shall pay the Adviser such compensation as may be payable for the period prior to the effective date of such termination. This Agreement shall automatically terminate in the event the Management Agreement is assigned or otherwise terminated.\n\n10. The Trust. The term \"PFS Funds\" means and refers to the Trustees from time to time serving under the Trust's Agreement and Declaration of Trust as the same may subsequently thereto have been, or subsequently hereto may be, amended. It is expressly agreed that the obligations of the Trust hereunder shall not be binding upon any of the Trustees, officers, employees, agents or nominees of the Trust, or any shareholders of any series of the Trust, personally, but bind only the trust property of the Trust (and only the property of the Fund).

Maimon also covenants that at any time after the termination of this Agreement, directly or indirectly, he will not use any Confidential Information or divulge or disclose any Confidential Information to any person, firm or corporation, unless such information is in the public domain through no fault of his or except when required to do so by applicable law. All written Confidential Information (including, without limitation, in any computer or other electronic format) which comes into Maimon's possession during the Service Term shall remain the property of the Company. Except as required in the performance of Maimon's duties for the Company, or unless expressly authorized in writing by the Company, Maimon shall not remove any written Confidential Information from the Company's premises, except in connection with the performance of his duties for the Company and in a manner consistent with the Company's policies regarding Confidential Information.

This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be binding upon, the parties hereto and their respective successors, permitted assigns, heirs and legal representatives. 2\n\n\n\n\n\n11. Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement contains the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be changed orally, but only by an agreement in writing signed by the party against whom any waiver, change, amendment, modification or discharge is sought. 12. Severability.
