This 10% of the total revenue generated is payable only if the EBITDA is a positive EBITDA and exceeds the 10% of the revenue. In cases of a positive EBITDA but shortage of funds compared to the 10% of the revenue, Distributor will take less than 10%. If the EBITDA is negative, no payments will be made to Distributor. Additionally, it will be the sole responsibility of Distributor to make a full disclosure of the 10% MDO to all its clients. (ii) The MDO will be payable within ninety (90) days from the date of the transaction (First Month payable by the end of ninety (90) days from the end of the month). (iii) For each Customer Kiosk contracted and implemented by Distributor, Company shall also pay a management fee of 40% of Net Income (Net Income for this purpose is defined as EBITDA less percentage paid to the client. The balance is then split 40%/60% to A3 Development Group, LLC and Smart RX Systems, Inc. respectively). Net Income is defined as total Customer revenue collections less all incurred expenses, and is the distributable cash generated by each Customer location. These payments will also follow the payment policy outlined in 4.1 above. (iv) The Payment(s) to Distributor or its Assignee, as set forth herein, shall be further set forth in each Class A Series Agreement, along with the respective ownership interest for both the Company and the Distributor (or its Assignee) for each respective Kiosk Location which shall have its own separate Series, as defined by the Texas Business Organizations Code for Series Limited Liability Companies, and as set forth in the Company's Operating Agreement.

The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have to  the Remarketing Agent or to any officer, employee or controlling person of the Remarketing Agent.\n\n(b) The Remarketing Agent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers, and employees and each of its directors, the Trust and  each Trustee and each person, if any, who controls any of the Issuers within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any loss, claim,  damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof, to which the Company, any such director, officer or employee, the Trust or any  such Trustee or any such controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage,  liability or action arises out of, or is based upon:\n\n(i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus,  any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed or is required to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities  Act, or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any Blue Sky Application; or\n\n(ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any free writing prospectus that the  Company has filed or is required to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act, or Prospectus or in any  amendment or supplement thereto, or in any Blue Sky Application, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the  statements therein (and with respect to the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus or any such free writing prospectus, in the light of the  circumstances under which such statements are made) not misleading;\n\nbut in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance  upon and in conformity with the written information furnished to the Issuers by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agent specifically for inclusion  therein (which consists of the information specified in Section 2(c)), and shall reimburse the Company and any such director, officer or employee,  the Trust or any such Trustee or such controlling person promptly upon demand for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the  Company or any such director, officer or employee, the Trust or any Trustee or any such controlling person in connection with investigating or  defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity  agreement is in addition to any liability which the Remarketing Agent may otherwise have to the Company or any such director, officer or  employee, the Trust or any such Trustee or any such controlling person.\n\n(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified  party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing  of the claim or the commencement of that action; provided however, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any  liability which it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and, provided further, that the  failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrelieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such claim or action shall be  brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate  therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel  satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of  such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses  subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided  however, the Remarketing Agent shall have the right to employ separate counsel to represent the Remarketing Agent and its respective officers,  employees and controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the  Remarketing Agent against the Company under this Section 7 if, in the reasonable judgment of counsel to the Remarketing Agent it is advisable  for the Remarketing Agent, its officers, employees and controlling persons to be jointly represented by separate counsel, due to the availability of  one or more legal defenses to them which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, and in that event the  reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Company; provided further, that the Company shall not be liable for  the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to one local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction) at any time for all  such indemnified parties. No indemnifying party shall:\n\n(i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or  consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which  indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim  or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising  out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, or\n\n(ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),  but if settled with its written consent or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to  indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.\n\n(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 shall for any reason be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party  under Section 7(a), 7(b) or 7(c) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, other than to  the extent that such indemnification is unavailable or insufficient due to a failure to provide prompt notice in accordance with Section 7(c), then  each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party  as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof:\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Issuers on the one hand and the Remarketing  Agent on the other hand from the Remarketing; or\n\n(ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Issuers on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the  other with respect to the statements or omissions or alleged statements or alleged omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or  liability (or action in respect thereof) as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.\n\nThe relative benefits received by the Issuers, on the one hand, and the Remarketing Agent, on the other, with respect to such offering shall be  deemed to be in the same proportion as the aggregate Accreted Value of the Remarketing Securities as of the end of day on the day next preceding  the Remarketing Settlement Date less the fee paid to the Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 4(a) and less the expenses paid by the Company  pursuant to Section 4(b), on the one hand, and the total fees received by the Remarketing Agent pursuant to such Section 4(a), plus the expenses  paid by the Company pursuant to Section 4(b), on the other hand, bear to such aggregate Accreted Value of the Remarketing Securities. The  relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission  to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Issuers on the one hand or the Remarketing Agent on the other hand, the intent of the  parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and  the Remarketing Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if the amount of contributions pursuant to this Section 7(d) were to be  determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to  herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to  above in this Section 7(d) shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 7(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such  indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7(d), the  Remarketing Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the total price at which Remarketing Securities distributed in the  Remarketing exceed the amount of any damages which the Remarketing Agent has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue  or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f)  of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.\n\nSection 8. [Reserved]\n\nSection 9. Dealing in the Remarketing Securities. The Remarketing Agent, when acting as a Remarketing Agent or in its individual or any other  capacity, may, to the extent permitted by law, buy, sell, hold and deal in any of the Remarketing Securities. The Remarketing Agent may to the  extent permitted by law exercise any vote or join in any action which any beneficial owner of Remarketing Securities\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmay be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Trust Agreement or the Indenture with like effect as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder.  The Remarketing Agent, in its individual capacity, either as principal or agent, may, to the extent permitted by law, also engage in or have an  interest in any financial or other transaction with the Issuers as freely as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder.\n\nSection 10. Remarketing Agent's Performance; Duty of Care.

The initial purchase price for trade units of the Products shall be set at $[***] per [***] sample tube of the Product, $[***] per [***] trade unit of the Product, $[***] per [***] trade unit of the Product, and $[***] per [***] trade unit of the Product, FCA manufacturing site (the \"Supply Unit Price\"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, after December 31, 2018 and during the term of this Agreement, Ferrer may change its Supply Unit Price on any or all the Products from time to time, but no more than once annually, based on documented actual increases to Ferrer's direct manufacturing and labor (but specifically excluding overhead) costs (or those charged by its nominee), provided that Ferrer furnishes the Company with at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of any such change. The increase shall apply to any order received by Ferrer after the communication date of the increase. In the event that the new Supply Unit Price for the Products may make the business not feasible, the Parties, in good faith and through the Joint Steering Committee, agree to meet and negotiate in good faith an alternative solution. The purchase price for the Products shall be paid in US Dollars by the Company and such payment terms shall be [***] following the date that the Products are received and accepted (as per Article 4.4 of the LSA) by the Company, by wire transfer into an account designated by Ferrer. Invoices shall be generated upon shipment of Product from Supplier. Invoices should be sent by email to the following address: invoice@cutanea.com. Failure to send invoices to the email address provided herein may cause a delay in approval and payment. In the event that the Company does not fulfill such terms, Parties agree to discuss in good faith alternative payment conditions. In case there is not an agreement between the Parties after 30 days, Ferrer will accept an irrevocable and guaranteed letter of credit payable as term of payment. Additionally, Parties agree to share exchange EUR/ USD rate fluctuations covering the payment of royalties. More concretely, within the first 30 days after every calendar year, Ferrer will calculate the average annual EUR/USD rate based on the EUR/USD rates published in the Financial Times the last business day of every month. Such EUR/USD average rate will be compared with the rate applied in every invoice during the year. If, as a result of this reconciliation, there arises a difference above or under [***]%, Parties agree to share the resulting amount on an equitable basis (50%). Ferrer will report the reconciliation to the Company for its acceptance and, after 15 business days, issue an invoice which will be debited/credited in the next 30 days by wire transfer into the accounts designated by the Parties.

EXHIBIT 10.2 FIRST AMENDMENT TO SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING AGREEMENT This First Amendment (\"Amendment\") to the Supply and Manufacturing Agreement dated April 1, 2017 between Cerus Corporation (\"Cerus\") and Porex Corporation (\"Porex\") (the \"Agreement\") is made this 22 day of June 2018. RECITALS A. Cerus and Porex have agreed to make certain changes to the raw material and process to develop Components and such changes have resulted in a change to the cost and expense structure originally contemplated by the Agreement; B. Pursuant to Section 3 of the Agreement, Cerus and Porex have mutually agreed to temporarily modify the pricing for Platelet Wafers set forth on Exhibit D and to proactively set a cost structure for non-production related work. NOW THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, the parties hereby agree to amend the Agreement as follows: 1. New Exhibits AA-1, AA-2, AA-3 and AA-4, as set forth in Schedule 1 to this Amendment, shall be attached to the Agreement (inserted between Exhibit A-5 and Exhibit B-1) and incorporated therein by reference. The parties acknowledge and agree that Exhibits AA-1, AA-2, AA-3 and AA-4 set forth the revised specifications for Platelet Wafers manufactured by Porex for Cerus (collectively, the \"Revised Wafer Specifications\"). Unless otherwise agreed in writing, Porex shall continue to manufacture and produce Platelet Wafers using the existing specifications for Platelet Wafers until Cerus gives written notice to Porex that Platelet Wafers shall be thereafter manufactured in accordance with the Revised Wafer Specifications. References in the Agreement to \"Specifications\" shall be interpreted to include the Revised Wafer Specifications, as applicable. 2. A new Exhibit D-1, as set forth in Schedule 2 to this Amendment, shall be attached to the Agreement and incorporated therein by reference. As of April 1, 2018 and continuing until Cerus determines, in its sole discretion, that the Protocol EPP-029-886 under which Porex is currently operating can be discontinued, the price for Platelet Wafers shall be the prices set forth in Exhibit D-1. Upon Cerus' determination that the Protocol EPP-029- 886 can be discontinued, Cerus shall provide written notice thereof to Porex, along with a new purchase order for Platelet Wafers (the \"New Pricing PO\"). On and after the date of such notice, the \"Pricing\" table for Platelet Wafers in Exhibit D, as of the date immediately preceding the date of this Amendment, shall be reinstated and apply to Platelet Wafers that are produced pursuant to the New Pricing PO and were also produced after the date of the written notice. References in Section 1.5.1 of the Agreement to \"Exhibit D\" shall be amended to include \"Exhibit D-1,\" as applicable. 3. The penultimate sentence in Section 1.3 shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: \"In no event shall any Purchase Order: require delivery of more than [*] units of [*] and [*] units of [*] in any [*] (the \"Porex Capacity Limitations\").\" 4. A new Section 1.5.3 shall be added to the Agreement as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5.3 Porex will invoice Cerus monthly for Services performed by Porex during the prior month. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable Statement of Work payment to Porex of undisputed fees shall be due [*] days following Cerus' receipt of the invoice submitted by Porex. Payment information, including Tax Identification Number will be included on each invoice.\n\nCerus shall have the right to accept or reject the Services, or any portion thereof, in writing within [*] days from Porex's completion of the Services. Such acceptance or rejection shall be consistent with the criteria set forth in the Statement of Work, if any. If Cerus does not reject in writing within [*] days, the Services shall be considered accepted by Cerus. Within [*] days of any notice of rejection, Porex shall present a corrective plan of action to Cerus. Upon approval by Cerus of the corrective plan, Porex, at no additional expense to Cerus, shall then make the corrections and, where applicable, Porex shall resubmit the corrected Services to Cerus. For disputed invoices or the disputed portion of an invoice, Cerus shall use reasonable efforts to provide to Porex, in writing, within [*] days, a description of the disputed amounts. Cerus and Porex shall negotiate in a timely, good faith manner to resolve billing queries. Cerus will not have responsibility to pay for identified errors, incomplete or inaccurate items (collectively the \"invoice errors\") which result in increases to previously invoiced amounts if the aforementioned invoice errors are communicated to Cerus later than [*] days from the original invoice date.\n\n5. A new Section 3a shall be added to the Agreement as follows: \"3a Non-Production Related Work. From time to time, Cerus may submit to Porex written work orders substantially in the form of Schedule 3 that specify development activities, engineering analysis, part, material and/or fixture design and development, or other services or activities that Cerus requests Porex to perform that are not activities or services that are necessary for the then-current manufacture and production of Components for Cerus under the Agreement (collectively, as defined in each work order, the \"Services\"). Each work order shall set forth the terms and conditions (including specifications (if applicable), delivery and performance schedules, and fees) pursuant to which Porex will perform the Services. Upon acceptance of a work order by Porex (in writing), such work order shall become a \"Statement of Work.\" If Porex begins to perform services under a work order that has not been formally agreed in writing, then Porex shall bear the costs of any expenses incurred prior to formal written agreement of the Statement of Work. Cerus hereby consents to Porex's use of the Cerus Dedicated Space and Equipment, as specified in a Statement of Work, solely as necessary to perform the Services under that Statement of Work. Such consent shall automatically terminate upon the completion of the applicable Statement of Work and is limited by the terms of the Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the Agreement and a Statement of Work, the Agreement shall control unless the Statement of Work expressly refers to the Parties' intent to alter the terms of the Agreement with respect to that Statement of Work and shall not be construed as an amendment to the terms of the Agreement.\" 6. A new section titled \"Pricing for Non-Production Related Work Orders from Cerus\" is added to Exhibit D as set forth in Schedule 2 attached. Such pricing, upon mutual agreement of the Parties, shall apply to any Statement of Work mutually agreed by the Parties pursuant to Section 3a. 7. No other changes are made to the Agreement, including without limitation, the original Exhibit D, and the Agreement, the Plasma Disk pricing and related information as set forth in Exhibit D remain the same. Except as amended herein, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meanings as set forth in the Agreement.

Retention of Rights. The only rights granted to the Sponsor hereunder are the right to receive the Benefits, and Racing hereby retains all  other rights with respect to the Racing Team, including but not limited to logos, symbols, names and other marks and intellectual property of the  Racing Team, and any proceeds derived by the Racing Team.

Relationship to Other Sponsors. The Sponsor acknowledges that Racing has arranged and may arrange in the future for other sponsors  for the Racing Team. Racing agrees that, during the term of this Agreement, (i) Sponsor shall have the right to approve or disapprove any  additional sponsor identified by Racing, and (ii) unless another proposed sponsor has agreed to pay a sponsorship fee that exceeds the amount  paid by Sponsor, no other sponsor shall receive any benefit of greater value (including either an equivalent or a more prominent use of another  sponsor's name, logo or other identifying information) than the Benefits provided to the Sponsor hereunder.\n\n8.

Billie and Craig Talesman, having an office located at 1800 Frank Huff Road, Seminole Reservation, Okeechobee, FL 34974, hereinafter referred to as \"SIC\".\n\nOverview\n\nThe purpose and intent of this strategic alliance is to combine the resources and talents of, TKCI and SIC, in order to take advantage of every opportunity permitted by tribal sovereignty to create revenue streams in multiple areas in conjunction with operating partners that have existing marketing and customers in place, thereby limiting the capital requirements and risk. New marketing advantages based upon competitive pricing, cross marketing and new revenue streams from expansion into other industries will grow the business beyond anything previously imagined. The structure may also be used for additional compatible acquisitions which will also fuel growth. TKCI believes that structuring operations with Tribal Sovereignty will deliver the financial advantages of operating in a tax free environment with limited liability, plus other benefits such as permit and zoning ease, supporting an ideal structure for investment capital and successful entrepreneurial ventures.\n\nTerm\n\nThe term of this Agreement is twenty-four (24) months. The Agreement may be renewed, subject to mutual written approval.\n\nNotwithstanding the completion, expiration or termination of this Agreement, the indemnities warranties and undertakings contained or referred to in this Agreement shall continue to subsist for as long as may be necessary for the purpose of giving effect to each one and every one of them.\n\nTKCI Committments\n\nTKCI shall establish a wholly-owned subsidiary (the \"Holding Company\") for the sole purpose of conducting and developing business on behalf of this alliance. The utilization of this subsidiary will provide for separate record keeping, reporting and tracking of all business related to this agreement.\n\nIn addition to capital recruitment functions, TKCI shall perform all of the functions and accept all of the responsibilities of the position of Chief Financial Officer including but not limited to management of accounts receivable and accounts payable, interfacing with Holding Company accountants on tax matters, interfacing with Holding Company accountants and lawyers on regulatory and compliance matters, and all other tasks typically and reasonably associated with the post and position of Chief Financial Officer.\n\nCommittments and Rights of SIC\n\nSIC acknowledges and agrees that the ability of TKCI to render its services is uniquely dependent upon\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2\n\n4.3\n\n4.4\n\n4.5\n\n4.6\n\n4.7\n\n5.\n\n5.1\n\n5.1.1\n\n5.1.2\n\n5.2\n\n5.5.1\n\n5.5.2\n\n5.3\n\n5.4\n\n\n\nthe cooperation and provision of information to TKCI by Chief James E.

Turnkey Capital Inc. (TKCI) will reserve ten percent (10%) of the shares of TKCI for SIC. These shares will be issued once an exclusivity agreement is reached. Once the Holding Company is raising funds and generating revenue, the parties will negotiate a monthly fee.\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n7.\n\n8. 8.1\n\n8.2\n\n9. 9.1\n\n9.2\n\n9.3\n\n\n\nConfidentiality and non-compete During the term of this Agreement and for one (1) year thereafter, TKCI will keep in confidence, not reveal, not use and not allow or assist others to use, any information marked \"Confidential\" received from or through SIC in the context of its activities hereunder, except as authorized in writing by SIC.

Except as permitted elsewhere under this Agreement, each party agrees to take Reasonable Steps (as defined below) (a) to receive and maintain the Confidential Information of the other party in confidence, (b) not to disclose such Confidential Information to any third parties and (c) to promptly notify the disclosing party upon learning of any law, rule, regulation or court order that purports to compel disclosure of any Confidential Information of the disclosing party and to reasonably cooperate with the disclosing party in the exercise of the disclosing party's right to protect the confidentiality of such Confidential Information. Neither party hereto shall use all or any part of the Confidential Information of the other party for any purpose other than to perform its obligations under this Agreement. The parties will take Reasonable Steps (as defined below) to ensure that their employees, representatives and agents comply with this provision. As used herein, \"Reasonable Steps\" means at least the same degree of care that the receiving party uses to protect its own Confidential Information, and, in no event, no less than reasonable care.\n\n      10.2. Exclusions. Nothing contained herein shall prevent a party from disclosing Confidential Information pursuant to any applicable law, rule, regulation or court order; provided, however, that such party complies with the notice provisions of Section 10.1(c)  [Confidentiality Obligations] to the extent permissible under applicable laws, rules, regulations or court orders. Such disclosure shall not alter the status of such information hereunder for all other purposes as Confidential Information.\n\n      10.3. Termination. Subject to Section 13.10  [Survival], upon termination of this Agreement, all Confidential Information shall be returned to the disclosing party or destroyed unless otherwise specified or permitted elsewhere under this Agreement. The confidentiality obligations contained in this Article 10  [CONFIDENTIALITY] shall survive termination of this Agreement for a period of three years.\n\n                                       16\n\n      10.4. Injunction. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Article 10  [CONFIDENTIALITY] are reasonable and necessary to protect the other party's interests in its Confidential Information, that any breach of the provisions of this Article 10  [CONFIDENTIALITY] may result in irreparable harm to such other party, and that the remedy at law for such breach may be inadequate. Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Article 10  [CONFIDENTIALITY] by a party hereto, the other party, in addition to any other relief available to it at law, in equity or otherwise, shall be entitled to seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief restraining the breaching party from engaging in and/or continuing any conduct that would constitute a breach of this Article 10  [CONFIDENTIALITY], without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting a bond or other security.\n\n      10.5. Publicity. Except as may be required by applicable laws, rules or regulations (including those arising under any securities laws), neither party will originate any publicity, news release or other public announcement, written or oral, whether to the public press or otherwise, concerning the relationship between the parties or the transactions described in this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event disclosure is required by applicable law, rules or regulations, then the party required to so disclose such information shall, to the extent possible, provide to the other party for its approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) a written copy of such public announcement at least five business days prior to disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party shall have the right to make a press release with respect to its entering into this Agreement; provided that such party provides to the other party a copy of the proposed press release no less than five business days prior to its proposed release and that the contents of such press release shall be subject to the other party's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.\n\n11.

Each person seeking to be reimbursed, indemnified, defended and/or held harmless under Sections 12.4  [Indemnification by PaperExchange] or 12.5  [Indemnification by VerticalNet] (each, an \"Indemnitee\") shall (a) provide the party obliged to indemnify such Indemnitee with prompt written notice of any claim, suit, demand or other action for which such Indemnitee seeks to be reimbursed, indemnified, defended or held harmless (each, a \"Claim\"), which notice shall include a reasonable identification of the alleged facts giving rise to such Claim; (b) grant such party reasonable authority and control over the defense and settlement of any such Claim; and (c) reasonably cooperate with such party and its agents in defense of any such Claim.

If ISO desires to use the services of an individual independent contractor who represents himself or herself as working for ISO using ISO's legal/business name (\"IC\"), then ISO shall enter into a written agreement with each such IC that (i) requires the IC to comply with all applicable terms of this Agreement and all applicable Rules, laws and regulations, and (ii) prohibits the making of any representation or creating any liability on behalf of SERVICERS.\n\n  (b)   ISO's currently utilizes the Other MSP's and IC's listed on Exhibit E attached hereto in its Merchant processing business. The parties agree to work together expeditiously and in good faith to transfer the registration or re-register all such entities with the appropriate Bank Card associations as required under the Rules. All Other MSP's must be appropriately registered before boarding accounts under Bank's sponsorship.\n\n2.5  SERVICERS' Obligations.\n\n  (a)   Bank will sponsor ISO, at ISO's expense, as an ISO for Visa, as an MSP for MasterCard and, to the extent applicable, as similarly required for all other Bank Card associations and, to the extent required by any Bank Card association, Bank also agrees to sponsor for registration with Visa and/or MasterCard those Other MSP's, IC's, subsidiaries and marketing representatives of ISO which are approved by SERVICERS. Unless otherwise disallowed by a Bank Card association, Bank agrees to maintain such sponsorships throughout the term of this Agreement and until the first of either to occur: (i) [***] days after the\n\n\n\n*** Omitted pursuant to a confidential treatment request.

Bank will forward to ISO all information routinely provided by each Bank Card association that is not otherwise available to ISO that are allowed to be shared with ISO under the Rules that would be helpful to ISO in fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n  (d)   Bank will maintain all cardholder information under its control and/or possession in a safe and secure manner in compliance with the Rules, and will report to Bank Card associations as required by the Rules relating to internal policies and procedures related to cardholder information security. Furthermore, Bank agrees to inform the ISO immediately regarding any breach of information security that may have an adverse effect to the ISO or to its Merchants.\n\n  (e)   Bank, as the acquiring principal member, agrees to represent ISO's interest in disputes that might arise from time to time with a Bank Card association over compliance with Rules and fines; provided, however, that ISO shall pay any fines or other charges imposed on Bank by a Bank Card association relating to the Merchant Program and any and all costs reasonably incurred by Bank in disputing the same, including reasonable associated legal fees.\n\n  (f)   FDMS has entered into an agreement with FFB, pursuant to which FFB will sponsor (or assume the sponsorship of) Merchants, FDMS and its customers, including ISO, into certain networks (\"Debit Sponsorship\"). ISO agrees to the additional terms and conditions relating specifically to the Debit Sponsorship, as set forth in Exhibit G.\n\nSECTION 3 MARKETING AND COMPLIANCE\n\n3.1  Application Materials. ISO shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that each Application completed by an Applicant is current and contains accurate and complete information. ISO's Application Materials shall comply with all applicable Rules, laws and regulations. All Application Materials and any changes to the form and content thereof must be approved in writing by SERVICERS prior to use by ISO, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed beyond [***] [***] days unless such changes\n\n\n\n*** Omitted pursuant to a confidential treatment request. The confidential portion has been filed separately with the SEC.\n\nPage 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    are voluminous. The initial approved Application Materials are attached hereto as Exhibit C.\n\n3.2  Compliance Responsibility. ISO shall be responsible for ensuring that the Application Materials, the marketing plans, the Promotional Materials and all services performed by ISO hereunder comply, and remain in compliance with, all applicable Rules, laws and regulations; provided, however, that SERVICERS will in good faith inform ISO of issues or concerns with ISO's materials or practices observed by SERVICERS that SERVICERS reasonably believe may be in violation of applicable Rules. All documents and any changes to the form and content thereof must be approved in writing by SERVICERS prior to use by ISO, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed beyond fifteen (15) days.\n\n3.3  Promotional Materials. ISO shall be responsible, at its sole expense, for the development of all Promotional Materials and shall bear the cost of the development and the printing and distribution of the Promotional Materials. The Promotional Materials shall comply with all applicable Rules, laws and regulations. All Promotional Materials and any changes to the form and content thereof must be approved in writing by SERVICERS prior to use by ISO, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed beyond fifteen (15) days. ISO and ISO's Other MSP's and IC's will not use SERVICERS' or SERVICERS' Affiliates' Marks in any advertising, promotional or display materials without SERVICERS' prior written approval, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed beyond fifteen (15) days.\n\nSECTION 4 APPLICATION AND UNDERWRITING PROCEDURES\n\n4.1  Applications. ISO shall solicit Applications from Eligible Merchants at ISO's sole expense and shall provide each Applicant with Application Materials. ISO shall collect completed and signed Application Materials and Merchant Processing Agreements from Applicants and shall forward them to SERVICERS within [***] [***] Business Days after the merchant is boarded (which may be accessed by SERVICERS online or forwarded to SERVICERS via ISO's automated application system or to a facsimile number designated by SERVICERS, provided such complies with the Rules and applicable laws, rules and regulations) or to any other place(s) as SERVICERS may designate for processing and document storage. ISO shall retain copies of all Application Materials, Merchant Processing Agreements and documents forwarded to SERVICERS. ISO shall provide SERVICERS with access to ISO's automated application system and ISO's online Merchant Account system (BAMS, or any such successor or replacement system) at no cost to SERVICERS.\n\n4.2  Underwriting. ISO shall underwrite, perform a credit review and conduct a site inspection, when applicable, for each Application as required by this Agreement, the Merchant Processing Policy and the Rules to determine whether each Applicant is an Eligible Merchant. ISO may conduct such credit review without notification to and participation by SERVICERS, except as otherwise provided below (i.e., for any\n\n\n\n*** Omitted pursuant to a confidential treatment request. The confidential portion has been filed separately with the SEC.\n\nPage 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    prospective Merchant that falls within the risk and volume parameters set forth in this Section 4.2), provided that ISO performs the credit review in accordance with the Merchant Processing Policy, the terms of this Agreement and the Rules. In accordance with and as permitted by this Agreement, a third-party service provider approved by SERVICERS may perform site inspections for ISO. In order to assist ISO in its underwriting hereunder, SERVICERS shall assist ISO with checking Merchants and prospective Merchants against the Terminated Merchant File/MATCH List or any similar list maintained by any entity. ISO shall be responsible for all credit and fraud losses associated with the Merchant Portfolio or the Program, regardless of any services or assistance that may be provided by SERVICERS. For any high risk Merchant who in good faith ISO anticipates will have annual Visa and MasterCard transaction volume equal to or greater than $[***] and any low risk Merchant who in good faith ISO anticipates will have annual Visa and MasterCard transaction volume equal to or greater than $[***], ISO shall advise SERVICERS and permit SERVICERS to conduct their own credit review prior to boarding the account. Upon receipt of a complete underwriting package from ISO, SERVICERS will respond to ISO within [***] [***] Business Days as to SERVICERS' acceptance or rejection of such Merchant. SERVICERS' participation in any credit review will not in any way relieve ISO from its responsibility for credit and fraud losses which may result from a Merchant's transaction processing. SERVICERS may at any time require that a Merchant relationship be terminated by ISO and Bank may cease the provision of services to any such Merchant pursuant to the terms of the Merchant Processing Agreement. SERVICERS shall have the right and authority to accept or reject any Application. ISO shall obtain prospective Merchants' authorization for ISO and/or SERVICERS to obtain all reports (including personal and business credit reports) and other information necessary in connection with the Application. ISO shall have the right, subject to and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merchant Processing Policy, to cause any Eligible Merchant with transaction card volume processing limits up to but not more than $[***] per month, that has been approved by ISO, to be activated immediately in SERVICES' systems. SERVICERS agree to provide ISO with a final approval decision (i.e., acceptance, rejection or required modification of the submitted Application) on submitted and complete Merchant Applications for Eligible Merchants that are not classified as \"high risk\" on the High Risk Merchant List attached hereto as Exhibit F and which seek approval for transaction card volume processing limits in excess of $[***] per month but not more than $[***] per month, within [***] [***] Business Days after SERVICERS' receipt of such completed Merchant Application and documentation.\n\n4.3  Credit Decisions. ISO shall employ the Merchant Processing Policy guidelines provided by SERVICERS in making credit evaluations. SERVICERS reserve the right, in their sole and absolute discretion, to:\n\n  (a)   Change the Merchant Processing Policy;\n\n  (b)   Reject the Application of any Applicant who SERVICERS determine does not satisfy SERVICERS' Merchant Processing Policy; and\n\n\n\n*** Omitted pursuant to a confidential treatment request. The confidential portion has been filed separately with the SEC.\n\nPage 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (c)   Terminate the Merchant Processing Agreement with respect to any Merchant at any time, according to the Merchant Processing Agreement terms.\n\nNotwithstanding anything contained herein, so long as all of the following are true with respect to a Merchant or Merchant Account, SERVICERS agree that, except as required by the Rules, SERVICERS shall neither terminate nor make any change with respect to the discount or reserve of said Merchant or Merchant Account that will have an adverse effect on the Merchant or Merchant Account without the prior written consent of ISO:\n\n  (i)   The Merchant or Merchant Account is not in a Bank Card association monitoring program;\n\n  (ii)   The Merchant or Merchant Account is not engaged in, or aiding and abetting, any illegal activity or fraud;\n\n  (iii)   The Merchant or Merchant Account is in compliance with the Merchant Processing Policy;\n\n  (iv)   The Merchant or Merchant Account is not processing transactions where products are delivered or services rendered more than one (1) year (on the average, based upon transactions of the immediately preceding three (3) months) following the date of the transaction;\n\n  (v)   No Bank Card association nor any regulatory agency has requested that the Merchant or Merchant Account be terminated;\n\n  (vi)   In its sole judgment, SERVICERS do not feel that they may be at financial risk as a result of the activity of a Merchant or Merchant Account; and\n\n  (vii)   The Merchant or Merchant Account is not causing reputational harm or risk to either of SERVICERS in their reasonable judgment.\n\nIn the event SERVICERS decide to terminate or make any such adverse change with respect to a Merchant or Merchant Account, SERVICERS shall first attempt to give ISO notice of SERVICERS' decision.\n\n4.4  Merchant Reserve Accounts. ISO shall be responsible for determining the amount of any Merchant Reserve Accounts. ISO shall also be responsible for ensuring all Merchant Reserve Accounts are adequately funded. All Merchant Reserve Accounts, along with any other monies or collateral collected from Approved Merchants, shall be deposited with Bank. [***] ISO will monitor daily Merchant account activity and if in ISO's reasonable judgment certain Approved Merchants and/or certain transactions are possibly fraudulent or otherwise not in\n\n\n\n*** Omitted pursuant to a confidential treatment request. The confidential portion has been filed separately with the SEC.\n\nPage 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    compliance with the Rules or in violation of the Merchant Processing Agreement, ISO will instruct SERVICERS to change the Merchant bank account information to cause funds otherwise due such Merchant to be diverted and deposited into the Merchant Reserve Account for such Merchant. ISO will thereafter promptly investigate each such suspicious incident and, upon request, promptly notify SERVICERS of the result of any such investigation. If in any case ISO's investigation determines that no violation occurred, ISO will promptly request SERVICERS to release any funds diverted to the Merchant Reserve Account to the Merchant's deposit account. Once monies or other collateral are deposited in a Merchant Reserve Account, SERVICERS shall control the disbursements of such funds which are to be (a) paid to ISO or SERVICERS to cover losses incurred in connection with the applicable Approved Merchant or (b) returned to the applicable Approved Merchant upon a reduction in the potential risk to ISO and SERVICERS arising from the provision of services to such Merchant within two (2) Business Days after receipt of a written request by ISO. From time to time, ISO may request SERVICERS to disburse monies held in a Merchant Reserve Account to ISO or an Approved Merchant as set forth in the preceding sentence, and SERVICERS shall consider such requests in good faith. Bank may draw against any Merchant Reserve Account to cover any Losses or credit and fraud losses incurred by SERVICERS with respect to an Approved Merchant without the consent of ISO or the applicable Approved Merchant.\n\n4.5  Maintenance of Underwriting Staff. ISO shall at all times maintain an adequate and qualified staff to perform underwriting and credit reviews of Program Merchants.\n\nSECTION 5 PROPRIETARY RIGHTS\n\n5.1  General. To the extent required by the Rules, legal title to all Merchant Applications, Merchant Processing Agreements and Merchant Accounts and records shall be in the name of Bank, subject to its obligations to effect a Program Transfer pursuant to Section 10.4 of this Agreement; provided, however, that Bank acknowledges and agrees that ISO shall own and maintain the Merchant relationship during the term of this Agreement and thereafter. ISO acknowledges and agrees that all Merchant Applications, Merchant Processing Agreements and Merchant Accounts and records may not be transferred, assigned, sold or exchanged by ISO except as set forth in this Agreement or the applicable Merchant Processing Agreement. Bank shall be exclusively responsible and entitled to receive all payments, collections, and other amounts due from Merchants, subject to its payment obligations to ISO. Each of ISO's and Bank's rights shall survive the termination of this Agreement by either party and for whatever cause.

ISO agrees that the initial amount of the Offset Account will be $[***] and, thereafter, the Offset Account will, at all times, maintain collected funds in an amount at least equal to the amount then due SERVICERS hereunder (which shall be referred to herein as the \"Minimum Balance\").\n\n  (b)   If the collected funds on deposit in the Offset Account at any point in time are less than the Minimum Balance, SERVICERS may fund the Offset Account with any monies or funds belonging or payable to ISO which are in SERVICERS' possession. SERVICERS will promptly notify ISO after making any such transfer.\n\n  (c)   ISO hereby grants SERVICERS a security interest in the Offset Account to secure all of ISO's obligations to SERVICERS under this Agreement.\n\n6.2  Settlement Procedures.\n\n  (a)   SERVICERS shall settle each Merchant Account in accordance with the terms of the applicable Merchant Processing Agreement, remitting to each Approved Merchant, by ACH or other acceptable method, all settled funds due to the Approved Merchant after first deducting from such settled funds all applicable Program Participation Fees and any other amounts owed or withheld under the applicable Merchant Processing Agreement. Merchant Account settlement is included in the fees set forth in Exhibit A and will not incur an additional fee.\n\n  (b)   On each Payment Date, SERVICERS shall credit ISO's Residual Account in an amount equal to all Net Program Participation Fees collected by SERVICERS since the immediately preceding Payment Date and which have not otherwise been paid to ISO.\n\n  (c)   In the event that the Net Program Participation Fees are insufficient to pay any amounts due to SERVICERS' under this Agreement (including compensation, funding the Offset Account, funding the Reserve Account, or paying third party processing fees), then ISO shall provide sufficient additional funds to SERVICERS upon demand.\n\n  (d)   [***]\n\n\n\n*** Omitted pursuant to a confidential treatment request. The confidential portion has been filed separately with the SEC.\n\nPage 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      [***]\n\n6.3  Payment Deferrals. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under this Agreement or applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, SERVICERS are hereby authorized by ISO, at any time and from time to time, without notice or demand to ISO or to any other person (any such notice and demand being hereby expressly waived), to setoff, recoup and to appropriate and to apply any and all monies or funds belonging or payable to ISO which are in Bank's possession against and on account of ISO's obligations to SERVICERS under this Agreement (including funding the Offset Account, the Reserve Account, the Termination Reserve Account or funding chargebacks), whether such obligations are liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured or unmatured.\n\n6.4  Expenses. Except as otherwise provided, each party shall bear its own administrative costs and overhead expenses arising out of its performance of this Agreement.\n\n6.5  Liability for Losses. Unless any Losses are caused by SERVICERS or are attributable to the negligence or willful misconduct of SERVICERS, SERVICERS shall have recourse from ISO, and ISO shall fully reimburse SERVICERS, for any Losses to SERVICERS that are caused by:\n\n  (a)   Chargebacks, purchase returns, refunds, credits, adjustments, fees or Bank Card association fines, costs and expenses related to Approved Merchants, Eligible Merchants, or any Merchant activity hereunder; and\n\n  (b)   Amounts remaining due to SERVICERS after the deduction of SERVICERS' compensation as provided herein.\n\n6.6  Bank Card Association Assessments/Fees. ISO shall pay or fund when due all Bank Card association assessments/fees, including any and all quarterly assessments/fees.\n\n6.7  Survival. The provisions of this Section 6 shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n*** Omitted pursuant to a confidential treatment request. The confidential portion has been filed separately with the SEC.\n\nPage 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.8  Assignment of Merchant Losses. SERVICERS agree that after SERVICERS have been fully reimbursed by ISO for a Merchant loss pursuant to this Agreement, and provided that the Merchant Account resulting in the Merchant loss has been terminated, that SERVICERS will, at the request of ISO, assign to ISO any and all of SERVICERS' subrogation rights under or related to the Merchant Processing Agreement (including guarantees, security or otherwise) related to the indebtedness of such Merchant under the Merchant Processing Agreement (including guarantees, security or otherwise), so that ISO may pursue collection recovery activities in connection with such Merchant loss. Any such collection recovery activities shall be conducted in the name of ISO and shall be subject to the indemnification obligations of ISO. Bank agrees to execute and deliver to ISO such assignment documents as reasonably requested and required by ISO to vest such collection loss(es) recovery right to ISO and as reasonably required in connection with such collection recovery activities.\n\nSECTION 7 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ISO\n\n    ISO represents and warrants to SERVICERS that, as of the date of this Agreement, the following are true and correct:\n\n7.1  Organization and Good Standing.

Each party also shall take the action as the other may, from time to time, reasonably request in order that the purposes of this Agreement will be fully accomplished and that all matters contemplated hereby will comply with all Rules or other applicable statutory, regulatory or other legal requirements. ISO shall promptly deliver to SERVICERS after receipt by ISO a copy of all non-routine notices or correspondence that it receives from MasterCard, Visa, or other networks or Bank Card associations, or any other third party, which in any way relates to any Merchant's or ISO's participation in MasterCard, Visa, and other networks or Bank Card associations under this Agreement.\n\n8.4  Compliance With Rules.

ISO and each Other MSP shall at all times, at ISO's and/or each Other MSP's cost and expense, maintain in effect during the term of this Agreement, a valid and effective registration as an independent service organization with Visa and a member service provider with MasterCard and shall provide any information as Visa and MasterCard may reasonably request in connection therewith or in connection with the services of ISO hereunder, and shall provide SERVICERS the information as it may reasonably request concerning compliance with all applicable Rules, laws, regulations and the requirements set forth herein in connection with this Agreement. The parties hereto will work together expeditiously and in good faith to register and maintain the registration of ISO and each Other MSP with the appropriate Bank Card associations as required under the Rules.\n\n8.6   Mark Restriction.

ISO shall make available (whether through public filings or directly) SERVICERS with annual audited financial statements prepared by an independent auditing firm within 90 days of the end of each fiscal year (and shall make available to SERVICERS quarterly financial statements upon request of SERVICERS). In addition, ISO will provide any shareholder/owner personal financial information as required by the Rules. ISO will, at any and all reasonable times, permit SERVICERS' employees, agents and/or auditors to inspect ISO's books and records at SERVICERS' expense prior request and notice and if for a particular need.\n\nSECTION 9 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\n\n9.1   Confidential Information. Confidential Information is non-public and proprietary information relating to the business of ISO or its Affiliates that SERVICERS and their Affiliates acquire during the term of this Agreement, and information relating to the business of SERVICERS and their Affiliates. It includes, but is not limited to, the following, whether used in, or to be used in, the business of ISO or SERVICERS: physical systems for the operation of the business; all present and planned strategies, business plans, and projections; all market and sales and marketing information; all\n\n\n\n*** Omitted pursuant to a confidential treatment request. The confidential portion has been filed separately with the SEC.\n\nPage 22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    financial, accounting, and credit information; and the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Neither party will disclose, furnish, sell, convey, or use for any purpose other than as contemplated under this Agreement any of the other parties' Confidential Information or materials without written authorization. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that all Merchant information is the Confidential Information of ISO and (i) may not be used by SERVICERS for any purpose other than to provide the services contemplated hereunder during the term of this Agreement and thereafter, and (ii) will not be used by SERVICERS, directly or indirectly, to solicit any Merchants in the Merchant Portfolio.\n\n9.2   Exclusions. Nothing in this Section 9 shall restrict either party with respect to Confidential Information which: (a) the receiving party can demonstrate was rightfully possessed by it before it received the information from the disclosing party; (b) was in the public domain prior to the date of this Agreement or subsequently becomes publicly available through no fault of the receiving party or any person acting on its behalf; (c) was previously received by the receiving party from a third party or is subsequently furnished rightfully to the receiving party by a third party not known to be under restrictions on use or disclosure; (d) is independently developed by such party; (e) is required to be disclosed by the Rules, law, regulation or court order, provided that the disclosing party will exercise reasonable efforts to notify the other party prior to disclosure; or (f) is required to be disclosed to comply with or to enforce the terms of this Agreement.\n\n9.3   Ownership of Work Product. Each party shall have and retain all ownership rights (including ownership of any Marks) in the work product developed for the implementation of the Program, including the Application, Merchant Processing Agreement and Promotional Materials that it creates, prepares or produces in connection with this Agreement, and all the work products shall remain the exclusive property of that party. Upon termination of the Agreement, each party shall immediately cease using any materials using the other's Marks or Intellectual Property, and shall immediately destroy all such materials.\n\n9.4   Remedy; Survival. If any party breaches this Section 9, the non-breaching party will suffer irreparable harm and the total amount of monetary damages for any injury to such party will be impossible to calculate and therefore an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, the non-breaching party may (i) seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief against the breaching party or (ii) exercise any other rights and seek any other remedies to which the non-breaching party may be entitled to at law, in equity and under this Agreement for any violation of this Section 9. The provisions of this Section 9 shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n\nSECTION 10 TERM AND TERMINATION\n\n10.1  Initial Term. The initial term of this Agreement shall be four (4) Processing Years commencing on the Effective Date of this Agreement and ending on June 30, 2010 unless\n\nPage 23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    terminated earlier as provided in this Section 10. Thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically continue in effect until either party gives the other at least six (6) months prior written notice of termination.\n\n10.2  Termination by SERVICERS. SERVICERS may terminate this Agreement prior to its expiration for cause upon prior written notice to ISO as follows:\n\n  (a)   Upon a Material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement by ISO which is not cured by ISO within sixty (60) days of receipt of written notice from SERVICERS; provided however, that if ISO is attempting in good faith to cure such breach within said sixty (60) day cure period but the nature of the breach prevents a cure within sixty (60) days, then ISO shall be allotted an additional number of days to cure, provided the total number of days of the cure period shall be no greater than one hundred twenty (120) days;\n\n  (b)   Upon a breach of any Material Rule by ISO, or repeated breach of any Rule by ISO which is not cured by ISO within sixty (60) days of receipt of written notice from SERVICERS; provided however, that if ISO is attempting in good faith to cure such breach within said sixty (60) day cure period but the nature of the breach prevents a cure within sixty (60) days, then ISO shall be allotted an additional number of days to cure, provided the total number of days of the cure period shall be no greater than one hundred twenty (120) days;\n\n  (c)   Upon any commission of any fraudulent activity by ISO, or the illegal activity of ISO's employees in the performance of their duties in connection with this Agreement;\n\n  (d)   Upon any failure by ISO to pay (or make arrangements to pay that are acceptable to SERVICERS) any amount due under this Agreement to SERVICERS which does not give rise to the right to terminate under any other provision of this Agreement within ten (10) Business Days after written notice to ISO of its failure to pay the amount;\n\n  (e)   Upon the insolvency or bankruptcy of ISO;\n\n  (f)   Upon a Material adverse change in the business or financial condition of ISO;\n\n  (g)   Upon an assignment of this Agreement by ISO without SERVICERS' prior written consent;\n\n  (h)   Upon the failure by ISO to maintain good standing as an \"independent sales organization\" with Visa or a \"member services provider\" with MasterCard;\n\n  (i)   If SERVICERS are required by a governmental or regulatory body or agency or by any Bank Card association to terminate the Services on behalf of ISO with as much prior notice as is practicable under the circumstances;\n\nPage 24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (j)   If ISO fails to fund the Offset Account or the Reserve Account as required under this Agreement within ten (10) Business Days after written notice to ISO of its failure to pay the amount;\n\n  (k)   Upon the termination of the Service Agreement for any reason with one hundred eighty (180) days prior written notice to ISO; or\n\n  (l)   Upon a Change of Control of ISO with one hundred eighty (180) days prior written notice to ISO, unless the SERVICERS had previously consented to such change in control.\n\n10.3  Termination by ISO. ISO may terminate this Agreement prior to its expiration for cause upon prior written notice to SERVICERS as follows:\n\n  (a)   Upon a Material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement by SERVICERS which is not cured by SERVICERS within sixty (60) days of receipt of written notice from ISO; provided however, that if SERVICES are attempting in good faith to cure such breach within said sixty (60) day cure period but the nature of the breach prevents a cure within sixty (60) days, then SERVICERS shall be allotted an additional number of days to cure, provided the total number of days of the cure period shall be no greater than one hundred twenty (120) days;\n\n  (b)   Upon any failure by SERVICERS to pay any amount due under this Agreement which does not give rise to the right to terminate under any other provision of this Agreement within five (5) Business Days after written notice to SERVICERS of its failure to pay the amount;\n\n  (c)   Upon the insolvency or bankruptcy of either of the SERVICERS;\n\n  (d)   Upon the termination of the Service Agreement for any reason;\n\n  (e)   Upon a Material adverse change in the business or financial condition of either of SERVICERS;\n\n  (f)   Upon an assignment of this Agreement by SERVICERS without ISO's prior written consent;\n\n  (g)   Upon the failure by SERVICERS to maintain good standing with Visa or a MasterCard;\n\n  (h)   If required by a governmental or regulatory body or agency or by any Bank Card association to terminate;\n\n  (i)   Upon cessation of Bank Card operations by SERVICERS; or\n\nPage 25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (j)   At any time upon one hundred eighty (180) days prior written notice to the SERVICERS with no penalty.\n\n10.4  Effect of Termination.\n\n  (a)   Upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, at the direction of ISO and pursuant to the plan of Deconversion, SERVICERS will transfer and assign all their interest in the Merchant Portfolio (including Merchant Processing Agreements and Merchant Accounts) and the dedicated BINs/ICAs to a Visa and MasterCard Member designated by ISO, provided first that: (a) all amounts due (or estimated to become due) in connection with each Merchant Processing Agreement and under this Agreement have been paid to SERVICERS; (b) the Termination Reserve Account has been adequately funded; (c) ISO provides full written indemnities to SERVICERS regarding actual and potential losses or other obligations arising out of operation of the Program or arising out of, or related to, this Agreement or any Merchant Processing Agreement; and (d) the Program Transfer complies with all applicable Rules, laws and regulations (the \"Program Transfer\"). [***]\n\n  (b)   Until the completion of the Deconversion of the Merchant Portfolio, the parties shall continue to operate under the terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided, however, that upon the effective date of expiration or termination of this Agreement, ISO will promptly discontinue its promotion and recommendation of the Program and will cease to board new accounts on Bank's BINs and ICAs or for sponsorship by Bank. ISO will reimburse SERVICERS for any Deconversion pursuant to the plan for Deconversion, regardless of whether such Deconversion occurs before or after the expiration or termination of this Agreement. ISO shall continue to hold all risks associated with transactions processed by SERVICERS prior to the effective date of Deconversion of each respective Merchant in the Merchant Portfolio, including all risk relating to chargebacks and fraudulent transactions. ISO shall pay SERVICERS any amounts associated with such risks immediately upon demand.\n\n10.5  Termination Reserve Account. Within ten (10) Business Days of the issuing of a notice of termination by any party, ISO shall fund a Termination Reserve Account. Except as specifically set forth otherwise in this Section 10.5, all provisions of Section 8.1 of this Agreement with regard to the Reserve Account shall also apply to the Termination Reserve Account. The amount of the Termination Reserve Account shall be the greater of (i) the most recent required amount for the Reserve Account prior to termination, or (ii) the amount calculated as follows:\n\n\n\n*** Omitted pursuant to a confidential treatment request. The confidential portion has been filed separately with the SEC.\n\nPage 26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (a)   The amount of all chargebacks during the [***] [***] months preceding termination, plus\n\n  (b)   The amount of all assessed Bank Card association fines or penalties and all fees and contingent fees which are or shall become due to SERVICERS from ISO, plus\n\n  (c)   The estimated maximum amount of any known or likely significant loss events (defined as a credit or fraud loss that is likely to exceed $[***]).\n\n    Upon termination, any balance in the Reserve Account shall be transferred to, and be applied toward, the Termination Reserve Account. The Termination Reserve Account will be held by SERVICERS until the completion of the Program Transfer or for such longer period of time as is consistent with SERVICERS' liability for Bank Card transactions in accordance with the Rules. SERVICERS will reduce the Termination Reserve Account balance to reflect any reductions in ISO's then-potential liability as the Program Transfer and Deconversion progress.

ISO shall indemnify, defend, protect, and hold SERVICERS, their Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, attorneys, and permitted assigns, harmless from and against any Losses and credit/fraud losses arising directly from:\n\n  (a)   Any failure by ISO to comply with any Material term or condition of this Agreement applicable to ISO, or the failure of any warranty or representations made by ISO in this Agreement to be true and correct;\n\n  (b)   Any claim for which ISO has otherwise agreed herein to pay or indemnify SERVICERS;\n\n  (c)   Credit or fraud losses, regardless of whether SERVICERS performed any underwriting, credit review, periodic review or fraud monitoring reviews on their own behalf;\n\n  (d)   Any negligence, misrepresentation or willful misconduct on the part of ISO or any of its employees, agents, Other MSP's or IC's related to this Agreement; and\n\n  (e)   Any claim by any third party related to this Agreement of a Merchant in the Merchant Portfolio that ISO's Intellectual Property violates or infringes any proprietary right of such third party, without any limitation of liability whatsoever.\n\n\n\n*** Omitted pursuant to a confidential treatment request.

General.\n\n  1.1.   ISO desires to deploy and service (or cause to be deployed and serviced), at merchant locations, terminals (\"POS Terminals\") that will be connected to the shared electronic funds transfer networks set forth on Schedule A to this Exhibit G, as it may be amended from time to time by FDMS in its sole discretion (the \"Debit Networks\"), to transmit point of sale transactions (\"POS Transactions\") generated by these POS Terminals through the Debit Networks' telecommunications and processing systems which effectuate the switching, processing and settlement of transactions (\"Debit Network Systems\"). (The services described in this paragraph shall be referred to in this Exhibit G as the \"POS Services.\").\n\n  1.2.   ISO may offer qualified merchants the ability to provide, or have Customer provide on such merchant's behalf, merchants' ISOs with the option to pay their bills by initiating funds transfers through Debit Network Systems without PIN entry or verification, subject to additional terms and conditions agreed to by the ISO and FDMS (\"PIN-less Debit\"). (The services described in this paragraph shall be referred to in this Exhibit G as the \"PIN-less Debit Services.\" The POS Services and PIN-less Debit Services, collectively, will be referred to in this Exhibit G as the \"Debit Services\").\n\n  1.3.   Debit Networks require that in order for ISO to provide the POS Services to merchants, merchants must be sponsored into the Debit Network by a member of such Debit Network (\"Network Member\"). Certain Networks (\"Standard Networks\") require that in order for ISO to provide the PIN-less Debit Services to merchants, merchants must be sponsored into the Debit Network by a Network Member.\n\n2.  Duties of FDMS. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, FDMS agrees to cause FFB, a Network Member, to: (a) sponsor Merchants into Debit Networks for provision of POS Services; (b) sponsor Merchants into Standard Networks for provision of PIN-less Debit Services through Standard Networks, subject to additional terms agreed upon by FDMS and ISO; provided, that FFB, in its absolute discretion, may refuse to sponsor any Merchant and may terminate its sponsorship of a Merchant or direct ISO to refuse to provide or terminate its provision of Debit Services to a Merchant.\n\n  2.1.   Neither SERVICERS nor FFB will be responsible for the acts or omissions of any Debit Network or its agents or representatives.\n\n3.  Conflict with Agreement. In the event of a conflict between this Exhibit G and the remainder of the Agreement as it relates to the subject matter hereof, the terms of this Exhibit G shall control. Otherwise, all terms and conditions of the remainder of the Agreement shall likewise apply to this Exhibit.\n\nExhibit G, Page 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchedule A\n\nDEBIT NETWORKS\n\n1.

APPOINTMENT AND ACCEPTANCE.\n\n   1.1. Appointment. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company hereby appoints the Agent, and the Agent hereby accepts appointment, as an authorized distributor agent within the Territory, (Territory as outlined in section 1.2), for the promotion, sale and collection of payment for, the Products to Customers. The Company has appointed a limited number of Agents; however, the Company retains the right to itself, and/or appoint others to, promote, sell, and collect payment for, and distribute, the Products to Customers in the Territory.\n\n   1.2. Territory. The Territory is defined as that geographical area in which said Agent is represented by a full time field sales representative, and of which assigned Distributor agrees to be responsible for mutually agreed upon quarterly and annual sales objectives as described in the \"Business Plan\".

Each Business Plan will include, among other things, sales and marketing strategies, advertising and promotion plans, financial projections (including projected sales, expenses and other customary items) and Agent performance criteria (including, but not limited to, market penetration, sales promotion execution, Product availability/accessibility and trade support).

The Business Plan relating to Contract Year ending Oct 31, 1999 will be agreed upon at least thirty (30) days after the Agent Launch Date (as defined below) or at a mutually agreed upon date and location. The Business Plan relating to all Contract Years thereafter will be agreed upon not less than sixty (60) days (or at a mutually agreed upon date and location) prior to the start of the Contract Year to which it relates. The Company and the Agent will negotiate the terms and conditions of each Business Plan in good faith, using their respective best efforts to agree upon such terms and conditions. The parties will review each then-current Business Plan quarterly and update such Business Plan from time to time as may be mutually agreed upon in writing.

Product(s) shipped to the Customer will be billed to the Agent       at the price stated on a current price list or according to the current       price program minus a ten (10) percent discount as outlined in Paragraph       1.5(d). It is the responsibility of the Agent to evaluate the credit       worthiness of the Customer. Upon transmitting an order for shipment to the       Company, the Agent accepts full responsibility for payment of the product       from the Customer.\n\n         (m) transmit all orders, taken from the Customer for Product(s), a       minimum of once daily basis, by either fax, electronic mail, or other       agreed upon means of transmission so as to afford the Company time to       process and ship said orders in an expediant manner.\n\n         (n) sell products only at the Company's current stated list or       promotional price.\n\n   1.5 Company Obligations. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Business Plan, the Company will at its sole expense:\n\n         (a) use its reasonable best efforts to fill and ship all accepted       orders for Products received from the Agent on a daily basis so as to be       shipped no later than the next business day. Orders received on Fridays or       the day before holidays will not be shipped until the next business day       unless special arrangements have been made at the customers expense. The       Company will supply a list confirming such order shipments to the Agent by       the end of the next business day. If orders exceed the available inventory       levels, the Company will use reasonable efforts to inform the Agent and       ship the remaining inventory in a manner that the Company deems as being       fair and equitable. If product becomes available during a backorder, the       Company will ship orders on a first-come, first-serve basis, but can, at       its\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n                                    -5-\n\n   own discretion, give partial shipments to large orders. In no event will       the Company be obligated to provide Products to the Agent in excess of one       hundred and twenty percent (120%) of any maximum quantity specified in the       applicable Business Plan;\n\n         (b) provide to the Agent's field sales personnel at least four (4)       hours of initial Products sales and marketing training, and Agent       telesales personnel at least one (1) hour of initial Product sales and       marketing training, and such supplemental training, if any, as the Company       may deem appropriate, in each case, at such times and locations as may be       mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Agent.\n\n         (c) supply such literature, ad reprints and other promotional aids       and furnish Agent with other information that in the opinion of the       Company may be helpful in the sale of listed Product(s).\n\n         (d) compensate the Agent through a discount of eight (8) percent off       of the current price of the Product times the total monthly units shipped       at that price to the Customer in the Agent's Territory excluding any       taxes, and/or shipping and handling charges incurred by the Company. The       Company will compensate the Agent an additional two (2) percent through a       discount off of the current price or promotional price of the Product       times the total monthly units shipped at that price to the Customer       excluding any taxes, and/or shipping and handling charges incurred by the       Company, so as to compensate the Agent's sales representatives. Therefore,       a total of ten (10) percent discount off of the current price list or       promotional price times the total monthly units shipped at that price to       the Customer will be applied as payment for services from the Agent       including, but not limited to, the promotion, sales, and collection of       payment from the Customer for Product shipped by the Company. In addition       the Company will compensate the Agent quarterly an additional two (2)       percent commission (incentive), exclusive of taxes, and /or shipping and       handling charges incurred by the Company, based upon the attainment of       mutually agreed upon quarterly goals. One (1) percent of this incentive is       additional compensation for the Agent, and one (1) percent is for       additional compensation of the Agency sales force. In the event the Agent       fails to achieve these goals during any given quarter yet is able to       achieve the overall annual goals, then the Agent will receive the       incentive commission for that quarter at the conclusion of the fiscal       year. These goals are outlined in exhibit B.\n\n         (e) will replace, any unit of Product to the Customer which has       outdated (provided the Product is not outdated more than ninety (90) days)       with equal Product.    7\n\n                                    -6-\n\n                      2.

The Company will give the Agent at least ten (10) days prior written notice of any price change.

Terms of payment by the Agent to the Company for Products shipped to the Customer will be net thirty (30) days from the date of statement unless the Agent chooses to pay the Company via electronic funds transfer in which case the terms of payment will be net forty-five (45) days. All payments will be made in United States Dollars without set-off or counterclaim, free and clear of (and without deduction for) any taxes, duties, charges, withholdings, restrictions or conditions of any nature imposed or levied by any political, taxing or other authority.\n\n   2.4. Taxes. The Customer will bear all taxes and duties which may be levied with respect to the purchase of the Products by the Agent (excluding any taxes on the Company's income therefrom), and the Company will bear all taxes and duties which shall be levied upon any of the Products if incidental to the Company's production of such Product or any component thereof. The Company will supply the Agent with such reasonable and necessary documents as may be required to carry out these provisions.\n\n   2.5. Claims. Any claim for shortage in Product delivery must be made within ten (10) business days after the Customer's receipt of shipment. See attachment \"C\", \"General Information\", for specific sales, shipping, and return policies.\n\n   2.6. Warranty. The Company hereby warrants that all Products sold to the\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomer hereunder, at the time of shipment to the Customer, (a) will be merchantable and of generally commercially salable quality; and (b) will have a then remaining shelf life of at least twelve (12) months. The Company further    8\n\n                                    -7-\n\nwarrants that the Products have been manufactured, labeled and packaged, and when in the Company's possession or under its control, have been handled, stored and shipped, in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws. The Customer's exclusive remedy for a breach of any of the foregoing warranties will be the replacement, at the delivery point thereof, freight prepaid, of any Product furnished hereunder that fails to meet the foregoing standards. In no event will the Company be liable for incidental or consequential damages. All claims by the Customer and/or Agent under this Paragraph 2.6 must be submitted in accordance with the Company's published bulletins concerning such claims, as such bulletins may be amended by the Company from time to time and furnished to the Agent.\n\n   THE COMPANY MAKES NO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR ANY OTHER WARRANTIES RELATING TO THE PRODUCTS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OTHER THAN THE WARRANTIES EXPRESSED IN THIS PARAGRAPH 2.6. ANY STATEMENTS MADE BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCTS DO NOT CONSTITUTE WARRANTIES AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON BY THE AGENT.    9\n\n                                    -8-\n\n                               3. COVENANTS.\n\n   3.1. Purchaser Guarantees, Instructions. The Agent will not furnish to any purchaser or user of the Products, or to any other third party, any guarantee or warranty with respect to the Products or any instructions for their use or maintenance, except as expressly approved in writing by the Company or as expressly stated on the Products' labeling and/or in materials provided by the Company to the Agent for such purpose.\n\n   3.2.

If, within thirty (30) days after receipt of a notice of a Third       Party Claim the Indemnifying Party fails to undertake to so defend, the       Notifying Party will have the right, but not the obligation, to defend and       to compromise or settle (exercising reasonable business judgment) the       Third Party Claim for the account and at the risk and expense of the       Indemnifying Party subject to the Indemnifying Party's prior written       approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Each       party will make available to the other, at the other's reasonable expense,       such information and assistance as    11\n\n                                   -10-\n\n   the other may reasonably request in connection with the defense of a Third       Party Claim.\n\n   3.6. Assistance with Claims.

Confidential Information and Publicity. From time to time during the term of this Agreement either party may disclose or make available to the other Confidential Information (as defined below) in connection with activities contemplated hereunder. Except as may be required by law or as may be reasonably necessary to enforce rights hereunder, each party agrees that during the term of this Agreement and thereafter (a) it will use Confidential Information belonging to the other solely for the purpose(s) of this Agreement and (b) it will not disclose Confidential Information belonging to the other to any third party (other than its employees and/or consultants reasonably requiring such Confidential Information for purposes of this Agreement who are bound by obligations of nondisclosure and limited use at least as stringent as those contained herein) without the express prior written consent of the disclosing party. Each party further agrees that except as reasonably necessary for performance hereunder or otherwise expressly required by law, it will not publicly announce or otherwise disclose any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement without the express prior written consent of the other. Except as may be otherwise expressly provided in the Business Plan, or as may be required by law or reasonably necessary to enforce rights hereunder, neither party will use the name of the other in any advertising, promotional or sales materials relating to the Products, in any press release, or in any other manner whatsoever without the express prior written consent of the other. Each party will promptly return to the other upon request any Confidential Information of the other party then in its possession or under its control. The provisions of this Paragraph 3.7 will survive the expiration or any termination of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, \"Confidential Information\" means, with respect to either party, any and all information (including, but not limited to, financial data and information concerning products, customers and business operations) in any form belonging to such party except information which at the relevant time is (a) known to the public through no act or omission in violation of this Agreement, (b) furnished to the receiving party by a third party having the lawful right to do so, (c) known to the receiving party prior to disclosure hereunder (as established by written documentation thereof) or (d) independently developed by the receiving party without reference to the Confidential Information.    12\n\n                                   -11-\n\n                         4. TERM AND TERMINATION.\n\n   4.1. Term. This Agreement will become effective as of the date first written above and will continue in effect thereafter until terminated pursuant to Paragraph 4.2 below.\n\n   4.2. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated as follows:\n\n         (a) In the event that either party fails in any material respect to       observe or perform any of its obligations under this Agreement (with       respect to the Agent, including but not limited to Agent performance       criteria set forth in each Business Plan), which failure is not remedied       within thirty (30) days (or, in the case of payments due, within five (5)       business days), after receipt of written notice from the other party       specifying such failure, this Agreement shall automatically terminate.\n\n         (b) In the event of any material change in the organization,       ownership, management or control of the business of the Agent, the Company       may, at its option, terminate this Agreement upon giving written notice of       termination to the Agent. The Agent will promptly advise the Company in       writing of any event described in this Paragraph 4.2(b).\n\n\n\n\n\n         (c) Either party may, at its option, terminate this Agreement       without cause, effective at any time after January 31, 1999, upon giving       at least ninety (90) days prior written notice of such termination to the       other party.\n\n         (d) If after exercise of good faith efforts, the parties fail to       timely agree upon a Business Plan for any Contract Year before the start       of such year (with respect to the Business Plan for Contract Year ending       October 31, 1999, at least thirty (30) days or on a mutually agreed upon       date after the Agent Launch Date), this Agreement may be terminated by       either party upon giving at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of       such termination to the other party.\n\n         (e) In the event of any publicity concerning the Agent which the       Company reasonably believes to have a material adverse affect upon the       status or reputation of the Agent and/or the Products, the Company may, at       its option, terminate this Agreement upon giving at least five (5) days       prior written notice of such termination to the Agent.\n\n         (f) In the event the Company terminates, sells or otherwise       transfers its veterinary products business in its entirety, the Company       may    13\n\n                                   -12-\n\n   terminate this Agreement upon giving at least ninety (90) days prior       written notice of such termination to the Agent.\n\n   4.3. Effect of Termination. Upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason:\n\n         (a) the Agent will immediately discontinue making any       representations regarding its status as an agent for the Company and will       immediately cease conducting any activities with respect to the promotion,       sale or distribution of the Products;\n\n         (b) all amounts owed by either party to the other will become       immediately due and payable as indicated in section 2.3;\n\n         (c) any then unfulfilled Product orders hereunder may be completed       by the Company or transferred to another Agent in the Company's       discretion. Any termination of this Agreement will be without prejudice to       the settlement of the rights created and obligations incurred hereunder       prior to the time of such termination. In no event will either party be       liable for special or consequential damages arising out of the breach or       the termination of this Agreement. The provisions of this Paragraph 4.3       and of Paragraphs 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7 will survive the termination of this       Agreement.\n\n                             5. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n   5.1. Notices. All notices and other communications between the parties given pursuant to this Agreement will be deemed to have been sufficiently given when delivered by personal service or sent by recognized overnight courier service, telecommunication or registered U.S. Mail to the recipient at the address indicated on the signature page hereof. All such communications will be deemed effective on the earlier of (a) actual receipt or (b) if sent by courier service, on the next business day following the date delivered to the courier service (the courier service's receipt being evidence of the date of such delivery), or (c) if sent by telecommunication on the next business date (subject to confirmation of receipt in complete readable form), or (d) if sent by registered U.S. Mail, five (5) business days after delivery to the U.S. Postal Service, postage prepaid.

This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.    14\n\n                                   -13-\n\nNeither party will not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the express prior written consent of the other party.\n\n   5.3. Waivers. Any waiver by either party of any rights arising from a breach of any covenants or conditions of this Agreement must be in writing and will not be construed as a continuing waiver of other breaches of the same nature or other covenants or conditions of this Agreement.\n\n   5.4. Relationship of Parties This Agreement is not intended to create, nor should it be construed as creating, a joint venture, partnership or similar relationship between the parties. The Agent will act solely as an independent agent and will have no right to bind the Company in any way or to represent that the Company is in any way responsible for any acts or omissions of the Agent.\n\n   5.5. Force Majeure. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if either the Company or the Agent is delayed in or prevented from fulfilling any of its obligations hereunder by reason of any cause beyond its reasonable control (including, but not limited to acts of God, fire, third party strike,\n\n\n\n\n\nflood, delay of transportation or inability to obtain necessary raw materials through normal commercial channels), then that party will not be liable under this Agreement for damages resulting from such delay or failure. Each party will promptly notify the other upon becoming aware of the occurrence of any such cause and will use its reasonable best efforts to minimize any resulting delay in or interference with the performance of its obligations hereunder.\n\n   5.6. Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

All remedies available to either party for breach of this Agreement are cumulative and may be exercised concurrently or separately. The exercise of one remedy will not be deemed an election of such remedy to the exclusion of other remedies.\n\n   5.9. Severability. In the event any provision of this Agreement, in whole or in part, is invalid, unenforceable or in conflict with the applicable laws or    15\n\n                                   -14-\n\nregulations of any jurisdiction, such provision will be replaced, to the extent possible, with a provision which accomplishes the original business purposes of the provision in a valid and enforceable manner, and the remainder of this Agreement will remain unaffected and in full force provided, however, that if without such invalid or unenforceable provision the fundamental mutual objectives of the parties cannot be achieved, either party may terminate this Agreement without penalty by written notice to the other.\n\n   5.10. Interest.

As between the Parties, Arizona, with respect to the Arizona Licensed IP, and the Buyer Entities, with respect to the Company Licensed IP, shall have the right (but not the obligation) for filing, prosecuting, and maintaining all Arizona Licensed IP and Company Licensed IP, respectively, in the licensing Party's name. For the avoidance of doubt, in case either such Party files any new Intellectual Property registration to the extent covering the Licensed IP, such new Intellectual Property registration shall automatically become Licensed IP. However, and for the further avoidance of doubt, the aforementioned shall not apply to new Intellectual Property created by a licensee Party or its Sublicensees separately and independently from the Licensed IP, for example in case of separate and independent technical enhancements or advancements. The Parties shall reasonably consult and coordinate with each other at the other Party's request with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 9.1. 9.2 No Additional Obligations. This Agreement shall not obligate either Party to disclose to the other Party, or maintain, register, prosecute, pay for, enforce, or otherwise manage any Intellectual Property except as expressly set forth herein. 9.3 Enforcement. As between the Parties, Arizona, with respect to the Arizona Licensed IP, and the Company or Buyer, with respect to the Company Licensed IP, shall have the right (but not the obligation) to elect to bring a Proceeding or enter into settlement discussions regarding, or otherwise seek to resolve, any infringement, misappropriation, or other violation, or allegations of invalidity or unenforceability, of the Licensed IP. In the event that Arizona declines to institute any Proceedings against third-party infringers or violators of any Arizona Licensed Patents, regarding activities that would fall within the Company Field if conducted by the Company, within forty-five (45) days after being notified or becoming aware of such infringing conduct, the Company or Buyer shall have the right to institute any Proceedings against such third-party infringers or violators. In the event that the Company or Buyer elects to institute such Proceedings, Arizona will reasonably cooperate with the Company or Buyer in such Proceedings, and the Company or Buyer shall reimburse Arizona for all reasonable costs and fees incurred by Arizona as a result of such cooperation. Such cooperation by Arizona will include joining such Proceeding as a party, if deemed necessary by the Company or Buyer. In the event that Arizona elects to bring a Proceeding against any alleged infringer of the Arizona Licensed Trademarks and seeks the cooperation of the Licensor of the Trademark License Agreement in such Proceeding, Arizona will take reasonable steps to assist the Company or Buyer in requesting the cooperation of the Licensor of the Trademark License Agreement, and pursuing an infringement claim against such alleged infringer. The Company or Buyer, as applicable, shall retain all benefits, recoveries, injunctions or other value derived from such Proceedings instituted by such Party. 10. INDEMNIFICATION 10.1 Indemnification. Each Party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party and its Affiliates and their respective employees, 9\n\n\n\n\n\ndirectors, officers, agents and successors (collectively, the \"Indemnified Parties\") from and against any and all losses (including all costs, liabilities (including present and future damages), claims and expenses) incurred or suffered by any of the Indemnified Parties, to the extent arising out of, relating to or resulting from (a) a breach by the Indemnifying Party of this Agreement; or (b) any gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnifying Party in connection with this Agreement. 11. DISCLAIMERS 11.1 Disclaimer. Each Party hereby acknowledges that, except to the extent expressly set forth in this Agreement, the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement, neither Party nor any of its Affiliates has made any representation or warranty, expressed or implied, including any representation or warranty regarding the validity, enforceability, or scope of the Licensed IP, noninfringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. 12. TERM 12.1 Term and Termination.

(b) Either Party may terminate this Agreement if the other Party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to remedy such breach within thirty (30) days' written notice thereof; provided, however, that if the material breach of this Agreement by the breaching Party is limited to the Licensed Copyrights, Licensed Know-How, the Arizona Licensed Patents, or the Licensed Trademarks, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to termination solely with respect to the affected part of the license (i.e., in such case, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement with respect to the Licensed Copyrights or the Licensed Know-How or the Arizona Licensed Patents or the Licensed Trademarks, as applicable). 12.2 Effect of Termination. (a) Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement, each licensee Party shall and shall cause all of its Sublicensees to cease all use of the Licensed IP that is subject to such termination (excluding for clarity (a) any Arizona Licensed Patents, Licensed Copyrights or Licensed Trademarks that are expired, invalid or abandoned or (b) any Licensed Know-How that no longer constitutes confidential information). 10\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Survival.

MISCELLANEOUS 13.1 Entire Agreement.

It shall be expressly understood that the Stock Purchase Agreement shall govern the transactions contemplated thereby as a whole and that this Agreement shall not be construed as an amendment or variation of the Stock Purchase Agreement but rather shall be complemented by and interpreted in light of the Stock Purchase Agreement. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is inconsistent with, conflicts with or contradicts any term of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement will prevail. 13.2 Assignment. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, including under Section 7.1, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of any Party under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party; provided, however, that (a) either Party may assign any of the foregoing in connection with the sale or other transfer of the applicable business or assets of such Party or its Affiliates to which this Agreement relates (except that neither of the Buyer Entities may assign any such rights, interests or obligations with respect to the Arizona Licensed Trademarks); (b) Arizona may assign any of the foregoing to one or more of its Affiliates and (c) the Company and Buyer may assign any of the foregoing to one or more of its Subsidiaries, controlled Affiliates, AWP, or any holding company that is a direct or indirect parent of the Company; provided that in each case (b) and (c), no assignment shall relieve the assigning Party of any of its obligations under this Agreement unless agreed to by the non-assigning Party.

Accordingly, each Party hereto also agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement by such Party, Arizona, on the one hand, and the Buyer Entities, on the other hand, shall be entitled to equitable relief without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, including in the form of injunctions and orders for specific performance. Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Arizona, on the one hand, and Buyer Entities, on the other hand, hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific 12\n\n\n\n\n\nperformance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Buyer Entities or Arizona, as applicable, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the Buyer Entities or Arizona, as applicable, under this Agreement. 13.5 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. (a) This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, its rules of conflict of laws notwithstanding. Each Party hereby agrees and consents to be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, or if the Court of Chancery lacks jurisdiction over such dispute, in any state or federal court having jurisdiction over the matter situated in New Castle County, Delaware, in any Action seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Party hereby irrevocably consents to the service of any and all process in any such Action by the delivery of such process to such Party at the address and in the manner provided in Section 13.3 hereof. Each of the Parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, or if the Court of Chancery lacks jurisdiction over such dispute, in any state or federal court having jurisdiction over the matter situated in New Castle County, Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such Proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. (b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE BREACH, TERMINATION OR VALIDITY OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 13.5(b). 13\n\n\n\n\n\n13.6 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement, or any portion thereof, is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement, or the remaining portion thereof, shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any such term or other provision, or any portion thereof, is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated to the fullest extent possible. 13.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, including by means of email in portable document format (.pdf), each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.\n\n[Remainder of page intentionally left blank] 14\n\n\n\n\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have duly executed this Agreement as of the date first written above.

You agree to execute the documents required by us, our bank and/or your bank in order to permit us to conduct electronic funds transfers to and from your account, and you shall not close your account without our prior consent. Your failure to comply with the terms of this Section 4.3 shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement. You hereby authorize us to initiate debit entries and/or credit collection entries to your bank account for the payment of Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fees, Franchise Sales Royalty Fees, National Advertising Fund Contributions, and all other sums that may become due to us or our affiliates from you. You shall make funds available for withdrawal by us by electronic transfer on such dates of each month as we shall designate throughout the term of this Agreement.

If the Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee, Franchise Sales Royalty Fee and/or National Advertising Fund Contribution we debit are less than the fees you actually owe us, once we have been able to determine the true and correct revenue amounts, we will debit your account for the balance on a day we specify. If the Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee, Franchise Sales Royalty Fee and/or National Advertising Fund Contribution we debit are greater than the fees you actually owe us, we will credit the excess against the amount we otherwise would debit from your account for the next payment due.   4.4 Interest on Overdue Amounts   Any payment not actually received by us on or before the Fifteen (15 th ) day of each month (or the next business day if the Fifteen(15 th ) of any month is not a business day) shall be deemed overdue and you shall pay to us, in addition to the overdue payment, interest on such overdue amount at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less. Interest shall accrue from the original due date until payment is received in full. Our right to such interest shall be in addition to any other remedies we may have, including, without limitation, the right of set-off to withdraw or retain, from time to time and without notice to you, any amounts due and unpaid by us to you. You shall not be entitled to set-off any payments required to be made under this Section 4 against any monetary claim you may have against us.\n\n5\n\nSource: SOUPMAN, INC., 8-K, 8/14/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  4.5 Late Fee; Insufficient Funds Fee   In the event you fail to provide us with any report we require on or before the date we require it, you agree to pay to us a late fee in the amount of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250). In addition, if, for any reason, any payment owed by you to us is denied by your bank due to insufficient funds in your account, then you shall, in addition to applicable interest as described in Section 4.4 above, pay us an insufficient funds fee in the amount of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250). If you incur three (3) late fees or insufficient funds fees within any twelve (12) month period, we will have the right to terminate this Agreement without providing you an opportunity to cure the default.   4.6 Unit Franchise Agreements and Revenue Reports   You shall submit to us copies of all Unit Franchise Agreements executed with Unit Franchisees within ten (10) days of the date of their execution, together with a copy of all checks presented to you at closing. You shall prepare and submit to us a monthly report, not later than the first (1 s t ) day of each month, of Franchise Sales Revenue generated by you during the previous calendar month.

Your failure to obtain execution of any covenant required by this Section 7 shall constitute a material default under the terms of this Agreement.   20\n\nSource: SOUPMAN, INC., 8-K, 8/14/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  8.

OBLIGATIONS UPON TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION   Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, all rights granted under this Agreement to you shall forthwith terminate and:   11.1 Cessation of Business   You shall immediately cease to operate the Franchised Business, and shall not thereafter, directly or indirectly, represent to the public or hold yourself out as a present or former master franchisee of ours.   11.2 Cessation of Use of Confidential Information and Proprietary Marks   You shall immediately and permanently cease to use, by advertising or in any other manner whatsoever, any confidential methods, procedures, and techniques associated with the System, and all Proprietary Marks and distinctive forms, slogans, signs, symbols, and devices associated with the System.   11.3 Cancellation of Assumed Name Registration   You shall take such action as may be necessary to cancel any assumed name registration or equivalent registration obtained by you which contains the Proprietary Marks; and you shall furnish us with evidence satisfactory to us of compliance with this obligation within thirty (30) days after termination or expiration of this Agreement.   11.4 Payment of Monies Due; Liquidated Damages   11.4.1 You shall promptly pay all sums owing to us and our affiliates. In the event of termination for any default of yours, such sums shall include all damages, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by us as a result of the default, which obligation shall give rise to and remain, until paid in full, a lien in our favor against any and all leasehold improvements, fixtures, furnishings and equipment, inventory, supplies and vehicles located at or used in connection with the Franchised Business, together with all accounts, payment intangibles, attachments, accessories, additions, substitutions and replacements, all cash and non-cash proceeds derived from insurance or the disposition of such assets, all your rights to use the Proprietary Marks, patents, copyrights and their registrations, trade secret information and other proprietary rights, and all rights granted, owned or licensed to you under this Agreement for the use of the Proprietary Marks, trade names, trade styles, patents, copyrights, trade secret information and other proprietary rights. We shall have full power and authority to file such documents as are necessary to obtain and perfect such lien. We shall have the right to set off any amounts which we deem are payable to us by you.   11.4.2 In addition to the foregoing, upon termination of this Agreement by us for cause as described in Section 10, you agree to pay to us within fifteen (15) days after the effective date of this Agreement's termination, in addition to the amounts owed hereunder, liquidated damages equal to the average monthly Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee and Franchise Sales Royalty Fee you paid during the twelve (12) months of operation preceding the effective date of termination multiplied by (a) twenty-four (24) (being the number of months in two (2) full years), or (b) the number of months remaining in the Agreement had it not been terminated, whichever is lower.   11.4.3 The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that it would be impracticable to determine precisely the damages we would incur from this Agreement's termination and the loss of cash flow from Royalty Fees due to, among other things, the complications of determining what costs, if any, we might have saved and how much the Royalty Fees would have grown over what would have been this Agreement's remaining term. The parties hereto consider this liquidated damages provision to be a reasonable, good faith pre-estimate of those damages.   11.4.4 The liquidated damages provision only covers our damages from the loss of cash flow from the Royalty Fees. It does not cover any other damages, including damages to our reputation with the public and landlords and damages arising from a violation of any provision of this Agreement other than the Royalty Fee sections. You and each of your principals agree that the liquidated damages provision does not give us an adequate remedy at law for any default under, or for the enforcement of, any provision of this Agreement other than the Royalty Fee sections.\n\n26\n\nSource: SOUPMAN, INC., 8-K, 8/14/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  11.5 Costs to Secure Compliance   You shall pay to us all damages, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by us prior or subsequent to the termination or expiration of the franchise herein granted in obtaining injunctive or other relief for the enforcement of any provisions of this Section 11.   11.6 Return of Manuals and Other Confidential Information   You shall immediately deliver to us the Manuals and all other records, correspondence, files, and any instructions containing confidential information relating to the operation of the Franchised Business which are in your possession, and all copies thereof, all of which are acknowledged to be our property.   11.7 Irreparable Injury to Us   You agree and acknowledge that your failure to comply with the provisions of this Section 11 will result in irreparable harm to us and to the Proprietary Marks, and you agree to pay all damages, expenses, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by us in obtaining specific performance of, or an injunction against violation of, and/or damages resulting from a violation of, the requirements of this Section 11.   11.8 Compliance with Post-Term Covenants   All of your covenants, obligations, and agreements which by their terms or by reasonable implication are to be performed, in whole or in part, after the termination or expiration of this Agreement, shall survive such termination or expiration.   12. TRANSFER OF INTEREST   12.1 Transfer by Us   We shall have the right to assign this Agreement and all of our attendant rights and privileges to any person, firm, corporation or other entity provided that, with respect to any assignment resulting in the subsequent performance by the assignee of our functions: (i) the assignee shall, at the time of such assignment, be financially responsible and economically capable of performing our obligations; and (ii) the assignee shall expressly assume and agree to perform such obligations.

Accordingly, neither you nor any immediate or remote successor to any part of your interest in this Agreement, nor any individual, partnership, corporation, or other legal entity which directly or indirectly owns any interest in you shall not sell, encumber, assign, transfer, convey, pledge, merge, or give away any direct or indirect interest in this Agreement, in you, or in all or substantially all of the assets of the Franchised Business. Any change in the control of you shall be deemed a transfer for purposes of this Agreement. Any purported assignment or transfer shall be null and void and shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement, for which we may immediately terminate without opportunity to cure pursuant to Section 10.2.3 of this Agreement.   12.3 Granting of a Security Interest by You   You shall not grant a security interest in the Franchised Business or in any of the assets of the Franchised Business without first obtaining our prior written consent. Our consent or refusal to consent may be based upon whatever factors we, in our sole discretion, deem economically and commercially reasonable in protecting our interests and security interest under this Agreement and the relationship created under this Agreement; however, if you are in good standing under this Agreement and all other agreements between us or our affiliates and you, we shall, upon your written request, execute a written subordination of our security interest to lenders and/or lessors providing financing for the Franchised Business. Under any circumstances however, we shall not consent to any such granting of a security interest unless all of the following conditions are met:   12.3.1 Such security is granted only for the purpose of securing a loan in your favor, which loan shall only be for the benefit of the Franchised Business.   12.3.2 In the event of any default by you under any documents in any way relating to the security interest or the loan to which it relates, we shall have the right at our sole option (but not the obligation) to cure any such default and/or to be substituted as obligor to the lender whose interests are secured by such security interest.   12.3.3 In the event of any such default, and if we choose to be substituted as obligor, we shall be so substituted in all respects on the same terms and conditions to which you were subject, except that any acceleration of the obligations secured, due to your default, shall be void upon cure by us.   12.3.4 Such other conditions and terms as we shall deem necessary and/or prudent to protect our interests under this Agreement.   12.4 Transfer Upon Death or Disability   Upon the death or permanent disability (mental or physical) of any person with an interest in this Agreement, in you, or in all or substantially all of the assets of the Franchised Business, the executor, administrator, or personal representative of such person shall transfer such interest to a third party approved by us within twelve (12) months after such death or disability. Such transfers, including, without limitation, transfers by devise or inheritance, shall be subject to the same conditions as any inter vivos transfer, except that the transfer fee shall be waived.

We may, in our sole judgment, take such actions as we deem necessary and appropriate to investigate, defend, or settle any event or take other remedial or corrective actions with respect thereto as may be, in our sole judgment, necessary for the protection of the Indemnitees or the System. You shall defend us and each of our affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, agents, and employees named in any lawsuit based on such loss or expenses and shall pay all costs and reasonable attorneys' fees associated with such defense. If we wish to retain our own counsel to defend any such action, you shall reimburse us for all reasonable costs and legal fees incurred by us for such defense. Said reimbursement shall be made to us in a timely manner upon demand as such fees are incurred by us and billed to you.\n\n31\n\nSource: SOUPMAN, INC., 8-K, 8/14/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  15.

You acknowledge that you are entering into this Agreement, and any ancillary agreements executed contemporaneously herewith, as a result of your own independent investigation of the business franchised hereby and not as a result of any representation made by us or persons associated with us, or other franchisees, which are contrary to the terms herein set forth or which are contrary to the terms of any Franchise Disclosure Document or other similar document required or permitted to be given to you pursuant to applicable law. Except for those permitted under this Agreement to be made unilaterally by us, no amendment, change, or variation from this Agreement shall be binding on either party unless mutually agreed to by the parties and executed by their authorized officers or agents in writing.
