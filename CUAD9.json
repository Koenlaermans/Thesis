ExxonMobil and FCE wish to further the research and development efforts to evaluate and develop new and/or improved MCFCs to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from industrial and power sources (\"Scope\"). Therefore, in consideration of the foregoing premises and mutual covenants contained herein, ExxonMobil and FCE (each a \"Party\" and collectively the \"Parties\") agree as follows:\n\nARTICLE 1 - DEFINITIONS\n\n1.01 Definitions. The terms appearing in this Agreement in initial capital letters, not otherwise defined in the preamble or body of this Agreement, are defined in Appendix A.\n\nARTICLE 2 - PROGRAM\n\n2.01 Program / Projects. The collaborative research and development effort will comprise one or more mutually agreed upon projects within the Scope during the Term of this Agreement (each a \"Project\" and, collectively, the \"Projects\" or the \"Program\"). The details of each Project will be described in a written, mutually agreed upon document (\"Project Description\") - a template for which is set forth in Appendix B. Each Project Description will specify the scope and content of the Project, the work to be undertaken by each Party and potential third parties, the deliverables, the timing, any payments to be made not otherwise set forth in this Agreement, and any other related objectives and expectations. When completed and signed by duly authorized representatives of both Parties, each Project Description will become part of this Agreement and will be governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Neither Party makes any representations as to the number, frequency, or monetary value of the Projects, except as otherwise set forth herein or in any Project Description.\n\n2.02 Subcontracting.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, ExxonMobil hereby grants approval for FCE solely to conduct Authorized Work using Generation 1 Technology with Authorized Third Parties for Carbon Capture Applications and any Work using Generation 2 Technology solely for Power Applications and Hydrogen Applications.\n\nPage 1 of 31\n\nSource: FUELCELL ENERGY INC, 8-K, 11/6/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 3 - PROGRAM GOVERNANCE\n\n3.01 Steering Committee. Promptly after the Effective Date, the Parties will establish a committee that will oversee technical support and provide overall supervision and administrative guidance for the Program (\"Steering Committee\" or \"SC\"), further detailed as follows -\n\n(a) Composition. Each Party will appoint in writing one or more of its employees as SC members. Each Party will have the right to change its SC members at any time by giving written notice of such change to the other Party.\n\n(b) Meetings. Meetings of the SC will be in person or by phone at a location and time agreed to in advance by the SC members.\n\n(c) Other Attendees. In addition to the attendance of SC members, with prior written notice to the other Party's SC members, each Party may also bring to any SC meeting such technical and other advisors as it may deem appropriate, provided that such advisors are employees of a Party or its Affiliates and are under written confidentiality and use restrictions at least as strict as those imposed herein. Otherwise, a Party's additional invitees may attend a SC meeting only with the other Party's advance written approval.\n\n(d) Responsibilities. The responsibilities of the SC will include, but are not limited to:\n\ni. Project Endorsement and Monitoring. The SC will review and approve each Project Description and amendment thereto prior to execution by the Parties. (However, no Project Description or amendment thereto will be effective unless and until it is executed by duly authorized representatives of both Parties.) The SC will periodically monitor the ongoing status of all Projects, and make adjustments to priorities within and between the Projects.\n\nii. Dispute Resolution. Assist the Parties in resolving any disputes.\n\n(e) Votes. Each Party only gets one vote on the SC regardless of the number of SC members it appoints. Except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, all decisions by the SC will be by unanimous agreement. In the absence of unanimity, ExxonMobil's SC representatives will have final decision making authority with respect to only the following decisions required by the SC: whether and where to seek patent protection and whether to maintain patent assets, subject to the provisions of Paragraph 6.04 (Solicitation of Program Patents Discretionary).\n\n(f) Minutes. All decisions by the SC will be documented in agreed upon minutes distributed to SC members after the meeting.\n\n(g) No Amendment Rights. The SC may recommend but has no authority to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\n\n(h) Costs. ExxonMobil will bear its own costs associated with participating in the SC. FCE's costs and expenses associated with its participation in the SC are included in each Project's budget as Direct Costs.\n\n3.02 Technical Managers. Each Party will appoint one manager for each Project (\"Technical Manager\"). The Technical Managers will be responsible for the coordination of all technical activities arising under such Project, and will serve as their Party's technical liaison with the SC for the Project. Each Party will promptly notify the other Party in writing upon changing the appointments. The Technical Managers for each Project will be the primary technical contacts between the Parties for that Project. The Technical Managers for each Project will jointly:\n\n\u2022 direct the work performed under a Project in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Project Description;\n\nPage 2 of 31\n\nSource: FUELCELL ENERGY INC, 8-K, 11/6/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 report to the SC on the progress of technical activities conducted under the Project;\n\n\u2022 monitor and coordinate all intellectual property activities relative to each Project; and\n\n\u2022 make recommendations to the SC on proposed publications containing Program Information.\n\nUnless otherwise mutually agreed, the Technical Managers for a Project will meet in person at least once each calendar quarter during a Project at such locations as the Technical Managers agree. The Technical Managers will communicate regularly by telephone or similar means between such meetings.\n\nARTICLE 4 - DISCLOSURE, CONFIDENTIALITY AND RESTRICTED USE\n\n4.01 Program Information Disclosure, Confidentiality and Use Restriction. FCE will promptly disclose to ExxonMobil, in written or other tangible form, any and all Program Information including any Program Inventions. Except as otherwise permitted under this Agreement, FCE agrees to hold Program Information in confidence, and not to disclose or make it available to any third party without the express prior written consent of ExxonMobil, for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending twenty (20) years thereafter. Without the express prior written consent of ExxonMobil, FCE agrees to use and practice Program Information only for the Program or as authorized in Article 7 (License to Program Results).\n\n4.02 Background Information Disclosure, Confidentiality and Use Restriction. Each Party will make available its Background Information to the other Party that it believes will be useful in carrying out work under the Program. Except as otherwise permitted under this Agreement, each Party agrees to hold the Background Information it receives from the other Party in confidence, and to not disclose or make available the other Party's Background Information to any third party without the express prior written consent of the other Party, for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending twenty (20) years thereafter. Without the express prior written consent of the other Party, each Party agrees to use and practice the other Party's Background Information only for the Program or as authorized in Article 8 (License to Background Information and Patents).\n\n4.03 Non-Analysis of Background Samples. Except as otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing, each Party agrees not to determine or have determined the composition or physical structure of any Background Sample received from the other Party, which includes unused, used and spent Background Samples or portions thereof, whether by analyzing, having analyzed, inspection, reverse engineering or otherwise.\n\n4.04 Information Handling Obligations. Each Party will endeavor to mark Confidential Information as follows:\n\n(a) Confidential Information first disclosed in tangible form or electronically will be marked by the Disclosing Party as \"confidential\" or \"proprietary\" or with words of similar import when provided, indicating whether the information is \"Program Information\" or \"Background Information\";\n\n(b) Confidential Information first disclosed orally or by visual display will be identified by the Disclosing Party as \"confidential\" or \"proprietary\" or with words of similar import at first disclosure and subsequently confirmed as confidential in a summary provided in an e-mail or other written communication delivered to the other Party within thirty (30) days after first disclosure, that references the date of the confidential disclosure indicating whether the information is \"Program Information\" or \"Background Information\"; and\n\n(c) If a Sample is sent to the other Party, the Sample will be marked by the Disclosing Party as \"confidential\" or \"proprietary\" or with words of similar import at the time of disclosure indicating whether the Sample is \"Program Information\" or \"Background Information\".\n\nPage 3 of 31\n\nSource: FUELCELL ENERGY INC, 8-K, 11/6/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nThe failure to appropriately mark information/materials as \"confidential\" or \"proprietary\" upon initial disclosure to the Receiving Party will not be considered a waiver of confidentiality. Information/materials marked as \"proprietary\" or \"confidential\" when first disclosed, without further identification of the category of confidential information, will be presumptively considered and treated as Program Information until the Disclosing Party notifies the Receiving Party otherwise in writing.\n\n4.05 Exceptions. For the purposes of this Agreement, the obligations of confidentiality and restricted use herein shall not apply to any information or materials to the extent the Receiving Party can establish by documentary evidence that one or more of the following exceptions apply:\n\na. the information or material was already in the Receiving Party's or its Affiliate's lawful possession (free of any confidentiality and use restrictions) and was not previously acquired directly or indirectly from the other Party under a current obligation of confidentiality;\n\nb. the information or material was already in the public domain or subsequently entered the public domain after disclosure through no fault of the Receiving Party;\n\nc. the information or material was or is hereafter furnished to the Receiving Party, or its Affiliate, on a non- confidential basis by a third party legally entitled to provide the information or material without restriction;\n\nd. the information or material was independently developed by employees or agents of the Receiving Party or its Affiliate who did not have access to relevant information provided by the Disclosing Party; and/or\n\ne. the information or material was released from the confidentiality obligations of this Agreement by the Disclosing Party's written authorization.\n\nThe later occurrence of any one of the aforementioned exceptions will not excuse any failure to adequately protect Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement prior to the existence of the exception. More specific Confidential Information will not be deemed to be within the foregoing exceptions merely because it is embraced by more general information that is publicly available or in the possession of Receiving Party pursuant to one of the exceptions. Also a combination of features will not be deemed within the foregoing exceptions merely because individual features are publicly available or in Receiving Party's possession pursuant to one of the exceptions.\n\n4.06 Disclosure to Affiliates, Contractors, and Sub-licensees. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a Receiving Party may disclose a Disclosing Party's Confidential Information to its Affiliates, and said Receiving Party may disclose the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information to their respective contractors providing services in furtherance of a Project as well as to permitted sub-licensees hereunder, provided such Affiliates, contractors, and sub-licensees have agreed to be bound by confidentiality and limited use obligations no less protective of Disclosing Party's Confidential Information than the terms contained herein. The Receiving Party will be liable to the Disclosing Party for any unauthorized disclosure or misuse of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information by such Affiliates, contractors, and sub-licensees.\n\n4.07 Compelled Disclosure. In the event that a Receiving Party (or its Affiliate) is required by law, court order or rule, or government authority to disclose the Confidential Information that Receiving Party is obligated to hold in confidence pursuant to Paragraph 4.01 (Program Information Disclosure, Confidentiality and Use Restriction) and/or Paragraph 4.02 (Background Information Disclosure, Confidentiality and Use Restriction), then the Receiving Party will promptly notify the Disclosing Party prior to disclosure in order to enable the Disclosing Party to seek a protective order at the Disclosing Party's sole expense. In any event, the Receiving Party who is required to disclose such information will request confidential treatment of the information and only disclose the minimum amount of information reasonably necessary to comply with such law, court order or rule, or government authority.\n\nPage 4 of 31\n\nSource: FUELCELL ENERGY INC, 8-K, 11/6/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n4.08 Disclosures in Patent Applications. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, ExxonMobil may disclose the minimum amount of FCE's Confidential Background Information reasonably necessary to support a Program Patent subject to the review process in Paragraph 6.02 (Solicitation of Program Patents).\n\n4.09 Return/Destruction. At the Disclosing Party's written request, the Receiving Party agrees to return to Disclosing Party or, at Disclosing Party's option, dispose of or destroy, Disclosing Party's Confidential Background Information and any of Disclosing Party's unused Background Samples. However, notwithstanding anything else in this Paragraph, the Receiving Party may retain such documents and materials to the extent such documents and materials are identified as necessary for beneficial use of a further Project or a license granted herein and the Receiving Party has notified the Disclosing Party in writing of the need for such documents and materials. Any dispute over whether such documents and materials are necessary shall be escalated to senior management for resolution. Furthermore, notwithstanding anything else in this Paragraph 4.09, the Receiving Party may retain one (1) copy of such documents and materials in its secure files for the sole purpose of administering its obligations under this Agreement and the Receiving Party will not be required to purge or cause others to purge electronic archival media automatically generated by backup computer systems if said media will be destroyed pursuant to a systematic records retention process and not otherwise utilized.\n\n4.10 Third Party Information. Neither Party will knowingly disclose to the other Party any proprietary or confidential information belonging to a Non-Affiliated Third Party without the Receiving Party's prior written consent.\n\nARTICLE 5 - PUBLICITY AND PUBLICATIONS\n\n5.01 Publicity. During the Term, and except for disclosures pursuant to Paragraphs 4.06 (Disclosure to Affiliates, Contractors and Sub-licensees), 4.07 (Compelled Disclosure), 4.08 (Disclosure in Patent Applications), or as otherwise permitted in this Agreement, the Parties agree that they will not disclose to any Non-Affiliated Third Party that they have entered into this Agreement, nor make any publications or publicity releases concerning the nature of this Agreement, without first acquiring the written consent of the other Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may make such disclosure as it may determine to be required by applicable law (such as filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission), provided that in such case the Disclosing Party will provide advance notice of such disclosure to the other Party and, where legally permitted, an opportunity to redact its sensitive proprietary information from such disclosure.\n\nFurther, during the Term, each Party agrees that it will not use the name, service mark or trademark of the other Party, or any Affiliate of the other Party, or provide any indication from which the identity of the other Party or its Affiliate may reasonably be inferred in any publicity release or other announcement, without first obtaining the written approval of the other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party hereby grants approval for the other Party to use its name, service mark or trademark in promotional materials that have a generally accepted description of the Scope, which such generally accepted description shall be mutually agreed to in writing beforehand. An exception to this Paragraph will include U.S. patent prosecution that refers to this Agreement as a \"joint research agreement\" under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(c).\n\nFurther, each Party agrees to include appropriate attribution of the other Party in any publicity release, advertising, print, media or other announcement concerning the use of MCFCs for carbon capture, the Program or the Program Results.\n\nPage 5 of 31\n\nSource: FUELCELL ENERGY INC, 8-K, 11/6/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n5.02 Publications. The Parties recognize that Program Information may be suitable for publication either jointly or individually. Unless the other Party specifically requests in writing not to be credited, appropriate recognition of the support or encouragement of the other Party will be included in such publications. The Parties agree to cooperate with each other on the preparation of any such publications. If any proposed publication contains the non-publishing Party's Background Information, such information (including reference thereto) will be deleted at the non-publishing Party's request. No publication that violates Article 4 (Disclosure, Confidentiality and Restricted Use) or Paragraph 5.01 (Publicity) will be permitted without the prior written consent of the other Party which may be obtained from a duly authorized member of each Party.\n\nARTICLE 6 - OWNERSHIP / PROCUREMENT OF PROGRAM RESULTS\n\n6.01 Ownership of Program Results. ExxonMobil will solely own Program Information, Program Patents, and copyrightable works resulting from the Program (collectively, \"Program Results\"), irrespective of whether the Program Results are conceived, created, developed or acquired by employees or other representatives of FCE, ExxonMobil, or both. FCE will assign, and hereby assigns, to ExxonMobil ownership of Program Results.\n\n6.02 Solicitation of Program Patents. ExxonMobil will have the sole responsibility and the exclusive right to prepare, file, prosecute, and maintain Program Patents pursuant to Paragraph 6.01 (Ownership of Program Results). Such right will include the right to determine if, where, and when patent applications are filed, and the scope of such patent applications. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ExxonMobil shall provide FCE notice of its intent to file any patent application containing FCE's Confidential Background Information and an opportunity for FCE to review any such patent application for FCE's Confidential Background Information. If FCE does not respond within thirty (30) days from ExxonMobil seeking such consent, then ExxonMobil may proceed with such filing. The cost of preparing, filing, prosecuting, and maintaining any such patent applications that ExxonMobil decides to pursue and maintain, as well as the cost of maintaining any patents resulting therefrom, will be paid in full by ExxonMobil. For Program Patents, if one or more employees or other representatives of FCE are determined to be inventors, then FCE will:\n\n(i) cause its employees, contractors, and consultants to render reasonable and timely assistance to ExxonMobil and its attorneys or agents;\n\n(ii) assign, and will cause its and its Affiliates' employees, contractors, and consultants to assign, its right, title, and interest in and to such Program Patent to ExxonMobil for filing; and\n\n(iii) cause its and its Affiliate employees, contractors, and consultants, to execute any documents as may be required to effect such assignments, or file, prosecute, and maintain any patent applications or patents that are based on, derived from, or protect such Program Patent.\n\nExxonMobil will hold formal legal title to all such patent applications, and resulting patents.\n\n6.03 Cooperation in Soliciting Program Patents. The Parties agree to cooperate in the preparation, filing, prosecution, and securing of patent applications and patents, all without charge to such other Party. When ExxonMobil's patent counsel sends to FCE documents for review that contains FCE Confidential Background Information, the Parties will follow the review process pursuant to Paragraph 6.02 (Solicitation of Program Patents). Upon FCE's written request, ExxonMobil will provide a courtesy copy of any Program Patent that does not contain any FCE Confidential Background Information prior to filing such document. All Program Patent filings, and the status thereof, will be reported to the Steering Committee.\n\nPage 6 of 31\n\nSource: FUELCELL ENERGY INC, 8-K, 11/6/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n6.04 Solicitation of Program Patents Discretionary. ExxonMobil has the unencumbered right to file or not to file, prosecute, defend, maintain, abandon, or enforce any Program Invention or Program Patent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event ExxonMobil decides not to prosecute, defend, enforce, maintain or decides to abandon any Program Patent, then ExxonMobil will provide notice thereof to FCE, and FCE will then have the right, but not the obligation, to prosecute or maintain the Program Patent and sole responsibility for the continuing costs, taxes, legal fees, maintenance fees and other fees associated with that Program Patent. The ownership of such Program Patent will remain with ExxonMobil.\n\nThe abandonment of a pending patent application in favor of a continuation patent application, continuation-in-part patent application, or divisional patent application, or in favor of another application of a related subject (e.g. to overcome a double patenting rejection) and ExxonMobil's decision not to file any Program Patent, will not be deemed to be an election not to continue to prosecute, issue, or maintain any Program Patent under Paragraph 6.04. In addition, (a) the failure to appeal a patent office or any administrative tribunal or judicial decision adverse to any patent or patent application, or (b) in the case of a co-pending non-provisional application in the U.S., (i) failure to enter an international patent application into the national phase, or (ii) to ratify a patent in any country, will not be deemed to be an election not to continue to prosecute, issue, or maintain any Program Patent under Paragraph 6.04.\n\n6.06 Joint Research Agreement. The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement is a \"joint research agreement\" as defined in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7100(h). The specification of any patent application filed pursuant to this Agreement may contain (or may be amended to contain) language required to invoke 35 U.S.C. \u00a7102(b)(2)(C) and \u00a7102(c) as applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Paragraph 5.01 (Publicity), ExxonMobil will have the right to invoke these statutory provisions when exercising its rights to file patent applications under this Agreement, without the prior written consent of FCE, subject to the provisions of Paragraph 6.02 (Solicitation of Program Patents). Where ExxonMobil intends to invoke these statutory provisions, FCE, upon request, will cooperate and coordinate its activities with ExxonMobil with respect to any submissions, filings or other activities in support thereof.\n\n6.07 Inventor Awards. A Party will not be responsible for any inventor awards or compensation that may be owed to the other Party's employee(s) or to any employees of the other Party's Affiliates, agents, consultants, or contractors, who are inventors of any Program Invention.\n\n6.08 Disposal of Prior JDA Project Patents. During the Term of this Agreement and for two (2) years thereafter, in the event that either Party decides to sell or convey its interest in or otherwise dispose of any Prior JDA Project Patent to any Non-Affiliated Third Party, such Party will inform the other Party, who will then have the right of first refusal to purchase or otherwise acquire the sole interest at same or better terms. Any sale of a Prior JDA Project Patent to a Non-Affiliated Third Party is subject to the licenses granted and other obligations set forth in this Agreement.\n\nARTICLE 7 - LICENSE TO PROGRAM RESULTS\n\n7.01 Grants to FCE of Program Results.\n\n(a) FCE's R&D Rights.

By the fifteenth (15th) day of the last month of the Term of the Agreement, ExxonMobil will have been invoiced for the actual charges incurred in all of the prior months of the Term of the Agreement, but the most recently issued invoice will not be due. Therefore, at such time ExxonMobil will not have yet paid for the last two (2) months of the Term of the Agreement. When FCE issues the invoice during the last month of the Term of the Agreement (\"8th Inning Invoice\"), FCE will apply some or all of the Initial Payment, as applicable, as credit against the amount due.\n\nii. Within fifteen (15) days after the end of the Term of the Agreement, FCE will issue an invoice (\"9th Inning Invoice\") for the actual charges incurred during the last month of the Term of the Agreement, subject to Paragraph 10.01(a). FCE will apply any balance of the Initial Payment remaining after the 8th Inning Invoice as a credit towards the amount due on the 9th Inning Invoice. If after applying such credit, a balance of the Initial Payment still remains, FCE will refund the balance to ExxonMobil within thirty (30) days, unless otherwise mutually agreed (such as the Parties mutually agreeing to enter into a new Project and apply the balance as a credit towards amounts payable by ExxonMobil thereunder).\n\ne) Maximum Charges. The invoices sent by FCE under the foregoing procedure for each year of the Agreement may not in the aggregate be more than half the Total Research Cost, without prior written consent of ExxonMobil or amendment to the Project Description. All such payments will be made after ExxonMobil's receipt of invoice in accordance with the invoicing procedures specified Paragraph 10.04 (Invoices).\n\n10.02 Up-Front Exclusivity and Technology Access Payment.

As further consideration for technical progress in the Program, ExxonMobil shall pay the following sums upon achievement of the following Program milestones (\"Milestone Payments\"):\n\n(a) ExxonMobil will pay FCE a first Milestone Payment of five million United States dollars ($5,000,000 USD) upon FCE achieving Milestone 1 to ExxonMobil's satisfaction; and\n\n(b) ExxonMobil will pay FCE a second and final Milestone Payment of five million United States dollars ($5,000,000 USD), upon FCE achieving Milestone 2 to ExxonMobil's satisfaction.\n\nAll such Milestone Payments will be made after ExxonMobil's receipt of invoice in accordance with the invoicing procedures specified Paragraph 10.04 (Invoices). The obligation to pay any such installment ends upon termination of this Agreement by either Party for any reason prior to FCE achieving the respective milestone.\n\nPage 12 of 31\n\nSource: FUELCELL ENERGY INC, 8-K, 11/6/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n10.04 Invoices.

Each invoice will identify this Agreement's identification number LAW-2019-3608, the number of the particular Project Description to which it pertains, and details of FTE Costs (including unique employee identifiers of the FTEs) and Direct Costs. FCE will not include charges relating to more than one Project Description in any given invoice. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, ExxonMobil agrees to pay FCE the amount of each invoice under this Agreement within thirty (30) days following ExxonMobil's receipt. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if ExxonMobil has a good faith dispute regarding any amounts invoiced by FCE, ExxonMobil may withhold payment for the disputed amount, provided that ExxonMobil pays the undisputed amount and notifies FCE in writing of the specific amount and nature of the dispute promptly upon receipt of FCE's invoice in which case the Parties shall attempt to resolve the dispute in good faith. The Parties shall endeavor to resolve such dispute within fifteen (15) days of notice of the dispute, and ExxonMobil shall remit payment to FCE within fifteen (15) days of resolution of such dispute.\n\nAll such payments by ExxonMobil to FCE will be made by wire transfer in United States Dollars.

If the Executive's employment commences or terminates part way through a holiday year, the Executive's entitlement during that holiday year shall be calculated on a pro rata basis rounded up to the nearest whole day. 12.3 The Executive shall have no entitlement to any payment in lieu of accrued but untaken holiday except on Termination. The amount of such payment in lieu shall be 1/260  of the Executive's salary for each untaken day of entitlement. 12.4 If on Termination the Executive has taken in excess of their accrued holiday entitlement, the Company shall be entitled to recover from the Executive by way of deduction from any payments due to the Executive or otherwise, one day's pay for each excess day calculated at 1/260  of the Executive's salary. 12.5 If either party has served notice to terminate the employment, the Company may require the Executive to take any accrued but unused holiday entitlement during the notice period. Any accrued but unused holiday entitlement shall be deemed to be taken during any period of Garden Leave.\n\n6\n\nth\n\nth\n\n\n\n\n\n13. Sickness 13.1 The Company may in its absolute discretion pay the Executive an amount equal to the Executive's normal basic pay (\"Company Sick Pay\") for the first 3 months of sickness absence in any rolling 12-month period, subject to such conditions as the Company may specify.

Any period of absence of up to five days may be self-certified and any period of absence of more than five days must be supported by doctor's certificate. 13.3 The Executive consents to undergo a medical examination by a doctor nominated by the Company at the Company's request and expense. The Executive agrees that any report produced in connection with any such examination may be disclosed to the Company and the Company may discuss the contents of any such report with the relevant doctor. 13.4 The rights of the Company to terminate the Executive's employment under the terms of this Agreement apply even when such termination would or might cause the Executive to forfeit any entitlement to sick pay, permanent health insurance or other benefits. 14. Outside Activities and Interests 14.1 The Executive shall not during the employment except as a representative of the Company or with the Company's prior written consent (whether directly or indirectly, paid or unpaid) be employed, engaged, concerned or interested in any other actual or prospective business, organisation, occupation or profession. 14.2 Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Executive from holding an investment by way of shares or other securities to in any entity listed or dealt on a recognised stock exchange (a \"Permitted Investment\") provided always that during the term of the employment the Permitted Investment shall not constitute more than 3% of the issued share capital of the entity concerned . 15.

Intellectual Property 16.1 The Executive shall disclose to the Company details of all Inventions and of all works embodying Intellectual Property Rights made solely or jointly with others at any time during the term of the employment which relate to, or are capable of being used in, the business of any Group Company whether or not in the course of their ordinary duties and whether or not made in working time (together, the \"Company IP\"). The Executive acknowledges that all Intellectual Property Rights subsisting (or which may in the future subsist) in such Company IP shall automatically, on creation, vest in the Company absolutely. To the extent that the Company IP does not vest automatically in the Company the Executive hereby assigns all right, title and interest in the Company IP to the Company with full title guarantee by way of a present assignment of all future rights and shall otherwise hold them on trust for the Company. The Executive agrees promptly to execute all documents and to do all acts as may, in the opinion of the Company, be necessary or desirable to give the Company full benefit of this clause. 16.2 The Executive irrevocably waives all \"moral rights\" under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all similar rights in other jurisdictions) which the Executive has or will have in any Company IP. 16.3 By way of security for the Executive's obligations under this Agreement, the Executive irrevocably appoints the Company to be the Executive's attorney to execute any instrument or to do anything and generally to use the Executive's name for the purpose of giving the Company or i ts nominee the benefit  of this clause. The Executive acknowledges in favour of a third party that a certificate in writing signed by the Company that any instrument or act falls within the authority conferred by this clause shall be conclusive evidence that such is the case. 16.4 The Executive agrees that the Executive's work for the Company will be the Executive's own original work and the Executive will not violate the intellectual property rights of third parties. The Company does not want and does not need any confidential information relating to any former employer of the Executive and the Executive agrees to not to copy, use or disclose such information. 17. Payment in Lieu of Notice 17.1 The Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, terminate the Executive's employment under this Agreement at any time and with immediate effect by notifying the Executive that the Company is exercising its right under this clause 17 and that it will make a payment in l ieu of  not ice (\"PILON\") to the Executive. The Executive's employment will terminate immediately and any PILON due to the Executive in accordance with the\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\nprovisions of this clause 17 will be paid within 28 days. The PILON will be equal to the basic salary (as at the Termination Date) which the Executive would have been entitled to receive under this Agreement during the notice period referred to at clause 2 (or, if notice has already been given, during the remainder of the notice period) less deductions required by law. 17.2 The Executive shall have no right to receive a PILON unless the Company has exercised its discretion in clause 17.1. 17.3 Notwithstanding clause 17.1, the Executive shall not be entitled to any PILON if the Company would otherwise have been entitled to terminate the Executive's employment under this Agreement without notice in accordance with clause 18. In that case the Company shall also be entitled to recover from the Executive any PILON already made. 18. Termination Without Notice 18.1 The Company may terminate the Executive's employment under this Agreement with immediate effect without notice and with no liability to make any further payment to the Executive (other than in respect of amounts accrued at the Termination Date) if in the reasonable opinion of the Company the Executive: 18.1.1 is guilty of gross misconduct; or 18.1.2 commits any serious or repeated breach or non-observance of any of the provisions of this Agreement or refuses to comply with any reasonable and lawful directions of the Company; or 18.1.3 commits any serious or repeated breach of the Company's policies or procedures; or 18.1.4 is grossly negligent or grossly incompetent in the performance of their duties; 18.1.5 is declared bankrupt or makes any arrangement with or for the benefit of their creditors or has a county court administration order made under the County Court Act 1984; or 18.1.6 is convicted of any criminal offence (other than an offence under any road traffic legislation in the United Kingdom or elsewhere for which a fine or non-custodial penalty is imposed); or 18.1.7 is no longer eligible to work in the United Kingdom; or 18.1.8 is guilty of any fraud or dishonesty or acts in any manner which brings or is likely to bring the Executive or any Group Company into disrepute or is materially adverse to the interests of any Group Company; or 18.1.9 makes any statement or other form of communication that disparages or undermines the goodwill or reputation of any Group Company. 18.2 The rights of the Company under clause 18.1 are without prejudice to any other rights that it might have at law to terminate the Executive's employment or to accept any breach of\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\nthis Agreement by the Executive as having brought the Agreement to an end. Any delay by the Company in exercising it rights to terminate shall not constitute a waiver thereof. 18.3 The Company may suspend the Executive from any or all of the Executive's duties during any period in which the Company is investigating any disciplinary matter involving the Executive or while any disciplinary procedure or regulatory investigation is outstanding. Any such suspension shall not constitute disciplinary action. During any period of suspension, the Company may impose the same conditions that apply to Garden Leave. 19. Garden Leave 19.1 Following service of notice to terminate the employment by either party, or if the Executive purports to terminate the employment in breach of contract, the Company may by written notice place the Executive on Garden Leave for the whole or part of the remainder of the employment. 19.2 During any period of Garden Leave: 19.2.1 the Company shall be under no obligation to provide any work to the Executive and may revoke any powers the Executive holds on behalf of any Group Company; 19.2.2 the Executive shall continue to receive their basic salary but shall not be entitled to receive any bonus or other incentives in respect of the period of Garden Leave; 19.2.3 the Company may require the Executive to carry out alternative duties or to only perform such specific duties as are expressly assigned to the Executive, at such location (including the home of the Executive) as the Company may reasonably decide; 19.2.4 the Company may appoint another person to carry out the Executive's normal duties; 19.2.5 the Executive shall remain an employee of the Company and bound by the terms of this Agreement; 19.2.6 the Executive shall be contactable during each working day (except during any periods taken as holiday in the usual way); 19.2.7 the Company may exclude the Executive from any premises of any Group Company, require the Executive to return any Group Company property and remove the Executive's access from some or all of its information systems; and 19.2.8 the Company may require the Executive not to contact or deal with (or attempt to contact or deal with) any officer, employee, consultant, client or other business contact of any Group Company as it may reasonably determine. 20. Obligations Upon Termination 20.1 On Termination or, if earlier, at the start of a period of Garden Leave following the service of notice or purported Termination by the Executive, the Executive shall:\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n20.1.1 immediately deliver to the Company all documents, books, materials, records, correspondence, papers, Copies, Confidential Information and other business information (on whatever media and wherever located) relating to the business or affairs of any Group Company or its business contacts, any keys and any other property of any Group Company, which is in the Executive's possession or control; 20.1.2 irretrievably delete any information relating to the business of any Group Company stored on any magnetic or optical disk or memory (including on any personal computer, personal device, personal email account or web account), and all matter derived from such sources which is in their possession or under their control outside the premises of the Company; 20.1.3 provide such handover of their duties as the Company shall consider appropriate; and 20.1.4 provide a signed statement confirming full compliance with the obligations under clauses 20.1.1 and 20.1.2 together with such reasonable evidence of compliance as the Company may request. 21. Post Termination Restrictions During the term of employment and for one (1) year thereafter, the Executive will not directly or indirectly, either themselves or through others, encourage or solicit any employee of the Company to leave the Company for any reason. This obligation shall not affect any responsibility the Executive has as an employee of the Company with respect to the bona fide hiring and firing of Company personnel. 22. Statutory Particulars 22.1 The Executive is subject to the Company's disciplinary and grievance procedures, copies of which are available upon request (although the Company reserves the right to deviate from these procedures in light of the Executive's seniority). These procedures do not form part of the Executive's contract of employment. 22.2 If the Executive wishes to raise a grievance or appeal a disciplinary decision the matter should be raised in writing with Rick Winningham. 22.3 There is no collective agreement which affects the Executive's employment or this Agreement. 23.

Upon Termination, the Executive's rights (if any) in respect of each Incentive shall be solely determined by the articles of association, rules or other documents governing each Incentive which are in force on the Termination Date and the Executive hereby irrevocably waives all claims or rights of action in respect of the loss of any rights or benefits under or in respect of any Incentive granted or not yet granted to the Executive (including any loss relating to the lapse of, or their ineligibility to exercise, any share options, the value of any shares, the operation of any compulsory transfer provisions or the operation of any vesting criteria)\n\n24.4 A notice given to a party under this Agreement shall be in writing in the English language and signed by or on behalf of the party giving it.

The Parties        acknowledge that their contract of carriage with their customers provides        that liability for loss, damage or delay, including liability for        consequential loss, is limited to Four Dollars and Forty One Cents        ($4.41) per kilogram or Two Dollars ($2.00) per pound unless a higher        value has been declared for insurance purposes.\n\n7.0    SET-OFF\n\n7.1    A Party shall pay to the other the full amount of any paid claim, loss        or damage for which it is liable within forty five (45) days following           presentation of supporting documentation.

Loss or damage sustained by the        indemnifying Party shall also include loss as a result of loss of use.\n\n8                                      - 8 -\n\n8.2    Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the        indemnifying party's liability to the other hereunder shall not        exceed the insurance coverage set out in Section 9.0.\n\n9.0    INSURANCE\n\n9.1    Each Party shall purchase and maintain, at its own expense, the        following insurance coverages:\n\n    (a)     cargo liability insurance, subject to a combined single limit of                not less than One Hundred Thousand dollars ($100,000.00)                inclusive per occurrence.

Such Services shall be provided by such        subcontractor/subcontractors on the same terms and conditions herein set        out and will be continued to be provided during the period of any such        strike or labour disruption, unless this Agreement is otherwise        terminated pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. It is        understood and agreed that, if such Party provides the Services by        subcontracting to another operator/operators, then it shall be deemed        not to be in default pursuant to paragraph 17.1(c).

or\n\n     (h)     if it otherwise neglects or fails to perform or observe any of                 its obligations under this Agreement and fails to cure the                 breach or default within thirty (30) days of written notice to                 the other Party.\n\n17.2    Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and in addition to any         rights or remedies available to it under this Agreement or at law or in         equity, the Party not in default may exercise any or all of the         following remedies:\n\n     (a)     terminate this Agreement, upon giving one hundred and twenty                 (120) days written notice, otherwise upon written notice with                 respect to 17.1 (g) and (h);\n\n     (b)     recover from the defaulting Party any and all monies then due                 and to become due; and\n\n     (c)     take possession, immediately, without demand or notice, without                 any court order or other process of law, any and all of its                 property (including bags and containers) and Freight received by                 the defaulting Party under this Agreement.\n\n17.3    Termination of this Agreement shall be without prejudice to any other         rights of the Party not in default, including the right to claim         damages, and to the rights of the Parties that have accrued prior to         termination.\n\n17.4    In the event the Defaulting Party fails to pay any amount due pursuant         to paragraph 17.2, then the other Party shall have the right to deduct         same from any amount due or to become due to the defaulting Party.    13                                      - 13 -\n\n18.0    PERFORMANCE PENALTIES\n\n18.1    In the event a Party has, in any twelve (12) month period, more than         three (3) Monthly Performance Failures, then the defaulting Party shall         pay a penalty to the Party not in default, which the Parties acknowledge         is a pre-estimation of damages suffered by the non-defaulting Party due         to the current month's Monthly Performance Failure (\"Default Month\").\n\n     For each Default Month, the Party in default shall pay a penalty equal         to five (5) times the Party not in default's corporate average yield         during the Default Month for each shipment below the performance\n\n\n\n\n\n     commitment.\n\n     For example, if the defaulting Party, in a Default Month, provided         services at an eighty five percent (85%) level and the average yield for         the Default Month of the Party not in default is ten dollars ($10.00)         and the total number of shipments handled by the defaulting Party         pursuant to this Agreement is one hundred (100), then the penalty would         be equal to 5 x[(Performance Commitment - Actual Performance Level) x #         of shipments] x average yield or 5 x [(90-85) x 100] x 10 = $250.00.                                       100 19.0    TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE\n\n19.1    Either Party may terminate this Agreement, without cause, by giving two         (2) years written notice.\n\n19.2    In the event of a change in control of a Party, the other Party shall         have the right, upon written prior notice, to terminate this          Agreement.\n\n20.0    NOTICE\n\n20.1    Any notice or other communication with respect to this Agreement shall         be in writing and shall be effectively given if delivered, or sent         (postage or other charges prepaid) by letter, facsimile or electronic         means addressed:\n\n     (a)     in the case of Purolator to:                                  Purolator Courier Ltd.                 5995 Avebury Road, Suite 500                 Mississauga, Ontario                 L5R 3T8                 Attention:\n\n     (b)     in the case of Dynamex:\n\n             Dynamex Inc.                 2630 Skymark Avenue                 Suite 610                 Mississauga, Ontario                 L4W 5A4    14                                      - 14 -\n\n     or to any other address of which the Party in question advises to the         other Party in writing.

Time of Payment\n\n(a) Each payment for a particular calendar month shall be due no later than the (20th) day of the subsequent calendar month.\n\n(b) The Licensee shall calculate the license fee payable to the Licensor for each month based on the Monthly Notional Volume  bands for that pay period and shall pay the Licensor accordingly. In no event shall the amount payable by the Licensor be  less than the amount recorded by the Licensee as being traded with the Licensed Technology multiplied by the applicable  Fees set forth above.\n\nIV. Record Keeping and Reports\n\n(a) As a condition of Licensee receiving the grant of a license herein, Licensee agrees to maintain reasonable records relating to  all trades conducted through the Licensed Technology and all other uses of the Licensed Technology by the Licensee  under this Agreement. Licensee shall prepare and submit summary quarterly reports to Licensor no later than 20 days  following the last business day of each calendar quarter, which reports must specify a complete record of usage of the  Licensed Technology by the Licensee and shall accompany the payments made to Licensor.\n\n(b) Licensee agrees to allow an independent Certified Public Accountant or other Audit Professional, (selected by mutual  agreement) to audit and analyze appropriate accounting records to ensure compliance with all terms of this Agreement. Any  such audit shall be permitted by Licensee within 30 days of Licensee's receipt of a written request of Licensor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Supplemental Payments will be paid by the Licensee to the Licensor within (10) days of receipt of said payments by the Licensee from third parties\n\n   (a) Simultaneously with the execution hereof, the Licensor shall issue to the Licensee 350,000 shares of its common stock as a bonus.\n\n(b) Rebate Shares. During the period commencing on the Acceptance Date through the thirty six (36th) month anniversary of this  Agreement, the Licensor shall remit to Licensee a series of rebates based upon the amount of Notional Volumes traded on the EPath FX  Trading Platform by Licensee. The computation of the rebates received by Licensee shall be expressed as a fixed percentage (15%) of  Billable Platform Fees paid by Licensee to Licensor. The rebates shall be payable in shares of Licensor's Common Stock; priced at $.25  cents per share. The amount of rebates earned by Licensee shall be calculated for each tranche of 30 Billion of Notional Volume traded in  the EPath FX Platform by Licensee. The amount of shares earned by Licensee shall terminate at the earlier of, the expiration of the term of  this Agreement or the receipt of Six (6,000,000) Million shares of Licensor's common stock by Licensee.    By way of illustration, if the Licensee trades 30 Billion of Notional Volume on the Platform, with a Billable Platform Fee of $279,000. The  rebate to Licensee will be calculated as follows:  Rebate = 15% of $279,000 = $41,850;  Shares of Licensor representing $41,850/$.25 = 167,400 shares of Licensor.\n\nV. Enhancements: Supplemental Payments\n\nI. During the term of the non-exclusive license agreement, Licensor shall receive from Licensee one third (33%) of the gross  amounts earned by the Licensee from third parties applicable to the following areas of the Licensed Technology usage (if any),  (\"Supplemental Payments\"):\n\n(a) Clearing fees\n\n(b) Banking Rebates (\"give-up fees\")\n\n(c) Processing of half pips\n\n(d) Swap rates (swap interest rate differential)\n\n(e) Currency spreads\n\nII. Shares\n\n\n\n\n\n  ARTICLE VI  SUB LICENSE AGREEMENT        Licensee agrees it shall not exchange, lease, sublease, distribute, assign, sell or otherwise transfer in any manner any right and/or interest  incident to the License Technology to any third party under any circumstances, without the prior written consent of the Licensor.

Sutro shall use reasonable efforts to promptly notify SutroVax in writing in the event that Sutro is unable or anticipates that it will be unable to supply compliant Product in accordance with the requirements of this Supply Agreement, including the Quality Agreement and all Required Standards, and each Work Order. Sutro shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to overcome any inability or anticipated inability to so supply compliant Product to SutroVax.\n\n2.9.2 Delivery Delays. Subject to Section 2.4.1 (including applicable lead times agreed upon in accordance with Section 2.4.1) Sutro shall make deliveries of Product(s) in accordance with Section 2.6, no more than [***] days before or [***] after the delivery dates specified by SutroVax in the relevant purchase order (provided that such delivery date is in accordance with the applicable Work Order or such purchase order was otherwise accepted by Sutro) (the \"Delivery Time Period\"). For any failure to supply compliant Product(s) in the later of the Delivery Time Period and the period ending [***] after the delivery date specified under the Work Order, without limiting SutroVax's other remedies, subject to this Section 2.9.2 and Section 9.3 (Limitation of Liability), Sutro shall be liable for any non-cancelable Third Party penalties, costs and expenses incurred by SutroVax as a result of Sutro's failure to supply Product(s) as aforesaid, subject to receipt by Sutro of appropriate documentary evidence of such penalties, costs and expenses to the extent such evidence of such amounts may be provided by SutroVax without breaching SutroVax's or its Affiliates' duties of confidentiality to such Third Party (and provided that SutroVax shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) minimize or eliminate such penalties, costs and expenses and (ii) where provision of such evidence to Sutro would result in a breach of such duties of confidentiality, to obtain the consent of the applicable Third Party to the provision of such evidence to Sutro). In the event that Sutro makes a Manufacturing Change and is not able to Manufacture and supply Product in conformance with the Required Standards within [***] days of the delivery date identified on the applicable purchase order, Sutro shall Manufacture such Product without such Manufacturing Change. The rights of SutroVax set forth in this paragraph are in addition to any other rights set forth in this Supply Agreement.\n\n2.10 Allocation. Without limiting any other rights or remedies available to SutroVax, if the demand for a Product in aggregate exceeds available supply or Sutro otherwise concludes that it may be unable to supply a Product in accordance with the requirements of this Supply Agreement in the quantities and within the time periods specified in each Work Order and the corresponding purchase orders that have been accepted by Sutro, Sutro shall immediately notify SutroVax of such shortfall (or anticipated shortfall), and shall use Commercially Reasonable\n\n\n\n\n\nEfforts to procure Components and capacity adequate to meet accepted purchase orders and supply compliant Product in accordance with the requirements of this Supply Agreement. Sutro shall allocate its available Components and manufacturing capacity to provide SutroVax with quantities of such Product at least equal to the greater of (a) [***] of the amount of Product (or products equivalent to Product) that Sutro allocates for itself and its Affiliates (but in no event less than [***] liters of Extract per month and the minimum allocation volume set out in Schedule 1 of each Custom Reagent per month), provided that SutroVax demonstrates actual need for the applicable quantities of Extract, and (b) the [***]. Without limiting the foregoing, if there is a shortage of supply of Product, Sutro shall provide Product to SutroVax for any quantities of Product ordered by SutroVax in accordance with the applicable Work Order or purchase order in priority to any subsequent Third Party purchase orders, but not in priority to any Third Party purchase orders or other binding commitment placed before placement of the applicable SutroVax Work Order or purchase order.\n\n2.11 Short Dated Product. Sutro agrees to ship all Product(s) so that they are delivered to SutroVax and will remain compliant with the Specifications for at least [***] months from the date of delivery in accordance with this Supply Agreement.\n\n2.12 Subcontracting by Sutro. Sutro shall (a) ensure that any subcontractor or delegatee of Sutro's obligations under this Supply Agreement has and maintains all appropriate qualifications; (b) enter into a quality agreement with each such subcontractor and delegatee which terms are similar to the terms of the Quality Agreement between SutroVax and Sutro; and (c) be responsible for each subcontractor's and delegatee's performance hereunder (including performance or non-performance by such subcontractor or delegatee that would constitute a breach of this Supply Agreement or such quality agreement if conducted by Sutro) as if Sutro were itself performing such activities. Sutro shall not subcontract the Manufacture of Product to a Third Party without SutroVax's prior consent other than to an Alternate Supplier as expressly set forth in Section 2.15.\n\n2.13 CMOs. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Supply Agreement, SutroVax shall have the rights to purchase Available Extracts and Extracts from CMOs (as defined in the License Agreement) to the extent provided in section 3.1 of the License Agreement.\n\n2.14 Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement. If requested by SutroVax in writing (which request shall not be made prior to [***]), the Parties shall negotiate in good faith reasonable terms and conditions of an agreement for the supply by Sutro of the Products for the production of Vaccine Compositions for use in phase 3 clinical studies and for commercial purposes (\"Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement\"). The price for the Products Manufactured by Sutro under the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement shall not exceed [***] of the Fully Burdened Manufacturing Cost thereof. If the Parties have not entered into the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement within [***] after SutroVax's request to negotiate the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement, upon either Party's request by written notice to the other Party the terms and conditions of the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement shall be determined by binding arbitration in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 11.4. Upon the selection of one draft Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement by the arbitrator pursuant to Section 11.4, unless SutroVax elects not to enter into such Phase 3/Commercial Supply\n\n\n\n\n\nAgreement by written notice thereof to Sutro within [***] days after such selection, the Parties shall execute the definitive Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement selected by the arbitrator (but excluding, for clarity, any provision granting to SutroVax or its Affiliates or Sublicensees any right to obtain or use any Sutro Core Know-How); and if SutroVax elects to not enter into the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement selected by the arbitrator by providing notice thereof within such [***] day period, then neither Party shall be obligated to enter into the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement.\n\n2.15 Qualification of Alternate Supplier.\n\n2.15.1 Transfer Addendum.\n\n(a) Transfer Addendum. Upon SutroVax' written request, the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith an addendum to this Supply Agreement setting forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which Sutro will conduct a Process Transfer to a Third Party contract manufacturer (\"CMO\") and/or engage such CMO to establish Capacity to Manufacture Extract (as Process Transfer and Capacity are defined below), in each case for the Manufacture and supply of such Extract for SutroVax' (or its Affiliate's or SutroVax CMO's) use to manufacture Vaccine Compositions, consistent with the remainder of this Section 2.15 (such addendum, a \"Transfer Addendum\"). As requested by SutroVax, this procedure may also be used in the event that SutroVax wishes Sutro to conduct a Process Transfer to a Third Party CMO in order to establish Capacity to Manufacture Custom Reagents. In connection with such request, SutroVax shall provide to Sutro a description of the desired Process Transfer and/or Capacity, including timing and other requirements thereof. Such Transfer Addendum shall:\n\n(i) include a plan and budget for the conduct of the Process Transfer and/or establishment of such Capacity, which shall include amounts charged by the CMO (as defined further below, the \"Alternate Supplier\") to receive and conduct such Process Transfer and/or establish such Capacity, as well as reasonable FTE costs for Sutro personnel performing and managing technology transfer activities in accordance with the Transfer Addendum\u00b7\n\n(ii) require SutroVax to fund the costs incurred by Sutro to conduct Process Transfer and/or establish such Capacity in accordance with such budget;\n\n(iii) provide for initiation and completion of the Process Transfer and establishment of Capacity as requested by SutroVax, to the extent possible;\n\n(iv) to the extent requested by SutroVax, be designed to enable the Alternate Supplier to Manufacture Extract of suitable quality for use in Phase 3 clinical trials and commercialization of a Vaccine Composition at a capacity to support SutroVax' projected commercial requirements for Extract (or other capacity identified by SutroVax in connection with the negotiation of the Transfer Addendum), as requested by SutroVax;\n\n(v) require the Parties to fully cooperate to verify that the Extract supplied by the Alternate Supplier meets the Specifications, to validate the Manufacturing process implemented at the Alternate Supplier and to qualify the Alternate Supplier, in each case to supply Extract for SutroVax' use in Phase 3 clinical trials and commercialization of a Vaccine Composition (collectively, with respect to Capacity established, \"Validating\" such Capacity);\n\n\n\n\n\n(vi) include mechanisms for keeping SutroVax fully informed, at scheduled intervals not to exceed once per quarter, of the progress of the Process Transfer and establishing such Capacity, as applicable, including with respect to the anticipated date for qualifying the Alternate Supplier and any changes to such anticipated date;\n\n(vii) provide a right for SutroVax to modify the timing of or terminate the Process Transfer, Capacity or specified aspects thereof on reasonable notice, subject to SutroVax' agreement to bear any resulting termination or cancellation fees charged by the Alternative Supplier; and\n\n(viii) include a mechanism for Sutro to cooperate with SutroVax and keep SutroVax reasonably informed with respect to Sutro's negotiation of an agreement with a potential Alternate Supplier for a Process Transfer and/or establishment of Capacity, including with respect to pricing for Extract from the Alternate Supplier to Sutro and any commitments to purchase quantities of Extract from the Alternate Supplier that SutroVax would be obligated to assume (e.g., in connection with establishing Capacity), if any, and require Sutro to obtain SutroVax' approval (not to be withheld unreasonably) of the terms of such agreement prior to entering into such agreement to the extent that the terms apply to SutroVax (it being understood that Sutro may redact any terms that are not relevant to SutroVax).\n\n(b) Scope. As used above, \"Process Transfer\" means a technology transfer of Sutro's know-how and information as is necessary or useful for the Third Party CMO to Manufacture in its own facilities Extract that meets SutroVax' requirements, including any such information and know-how as would be needed for such CMO to scale up such Manufacture to the requested commercial volumes. To establish \"Capacity\" means that the CMO would take such actions as are necessary (including validation and if necessary adapting or reserving existing facilities, establishing new facilities and/or procuring necessary equipment) to Manufacture Extract meeting SutroVax' requirements for Phase 3 and commercial supply in such quantities as SutroVax designates. It is understood that SutroVax may request that the Process Transfer and establishment of Capacity be undertaken in separate steps, for example by undertaking an initial Process Transfer to demonstrate the CMO's ability to Manufacture Extract, and then later establishing Capacity for Phase 3 and commercial supply, as requested by SutroVax in accordance with Section 2.15.1(a) (i.e., in separate requests).\n\n(c) Selection of Alternate Supplier. The \"Alternate Supplier\" will be selected by Sutro, provided that Sutro must select an \"Alternate Supplier\" that is substantially similar to those CMOs identified on Schedule 2.15.1 hereto and provided further that SutroVax shall have the right to veto such selection based only on a genuine and material conflict of interest between SutroVax and the Alternate Supplier. Additional CMOs may be added to Schedule 2.15.1 by Sutro with SutroVax's approval (not to be withheld unreasonably).\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Alternate Supplier as Subcontractor. It is understood that the Alternate Supplier established under the Transfer Addendum shall operate as a subcontractor of Sutro under this Supply Agreement and the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement, and as such SutroVax will order from Sutro thereunder any Extract to be Manufactured by such Alternate Supplier. Subject to the foregoing, the Transfer Addendum and the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement will include reasonable and customary rights for SutroVax to conduct audits/inspections, site visits, quarterly meetings, each such audit/inspection, site visit and quarterly meeting to be coordinated by Sutro and to occur in the presence of a representative for Sutro and SutroVax, in connection with the Alternate Supplier's manufacture of Extract for supply to SutroVax. For clarity, SutroVax shall not conduct any business discussions for the supply of Extract with the Alternate Supplier in a manner that induces the Alternate Supplier to breach its agreement with Sutro. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Sutro undergoes a Change of Control or Sutro permits any third party to acquire Extract directly from an Alternate Supplier established under the Transfer Addendum, then SutroVax shall thereafter have the right to establish a supply agreement with and obtain supply of Extract directly from such Alternate Supplier.\n\n(e) Quotations. Upon SutroVax's request (which request, for clarity, may be before a request to negotiate a Transfer Addendum), Sutro shall seek quotations from one or more Third Party CMO(s) for such a Process Transfer and/or establishment of such Capacity, in each case as requested by SutroVax, and the Parties shall reasonably cooperate to establish requests for quotations for such purposes.\n\n(f) Arbitration. If the Parties have not agreed upon a Transfer Addendum within [***] after SutroVax' request, upon SutroVax' request by written notice to Sutro, the terms and conditions of the Transfer Addendum shall be determined by binding arbitration in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 11.4. For clarity, however, it is understood that a Transfer Addendum shall not include any provision granting to SutroVax or its Affiliates or Sublicens.ee s any right to obtain or use any Sutro Core Know-How.\n\n2.15.2 Source of Supply. It is understood that after the Alternate Supplier is qualified, SutroVax shall have the right under this Supply Agreement and the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement to specify whether Extract ordered from Sutro pursuant to this Agreement or the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement will be Manufactured at Sutro's Facility or at the Alternate Supplier's facilities (and to the extent Extract from the Alternate Supplier is ordered under this Supply Agreement or the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement, the facility of the Alternate Supplier shall be deemed a Facility for purposes of this Supply Agreement and the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent the FDA and EMA have confirmed that Extract manufactured at Sutro's Facility and the Alternate Supplier's Facility are interchangeable and can be supplied from either such Facility without any additional regulatory requirements or regulatory delay with respect to the applicable Vaccine Composition, and such Extract otherwise meets SutroVax' requirements, then with SutroVax' consent (not to be withheld unreasonably) Sutro may supply Extract from either Sutro's Facility or the Alternate Supplier's Facility.\n\n2.15.3 Price. To the extent Sutro or its Affiliate Manufactures Extract supplied to SutroVax, the Price (per unit volume or unit weight) under this Supply Agreement and the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement for such Extract shall not exceed [***] of the Fully Burdened Manufacturing Costs of such Extract; and to the extent the Extract to be supplied to SutroVax is Manufactured by a Third Party (including the Alternate Supplier), the Price to be\n\n\n\n\n\ncharged to SutroVax under this Supply Agreement and the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement for such Extract shall equal the amount Sutro paid such Third Party for such Extract (\"OOP Cost\") plus an amount reasonably calculated to cover Sutro's FTE costs to procure and manage the relationship with such Third Party, such amount not to exceed [***] of the OOP Cost for such Extract. To the extent that Sutro or its Affiliate receives any portion of the amounts paid to such Third Party to Manufacture Extract (e.g., as a profit share or otherwise), the Price to be charged SutroVax shall be the lesser of i) [***], or ii) [***]; in either case, [***]. For clarity, Section 3.4 of the License Agreement shall apply with respect to the Alternate Supplier.\n\n2.15.4 Sutro/Third Party use of Alternate Supplier. Once the Alternate Supplier is qualified pursuant to this Section 2.15, SutroVax shall have the first right (as between SutroVax and Sutro or Third Parties supplied or authorized by Sutro) to obtain Extract Manufactured by the Alternate Supplier up to the Capacity established pursuant to the Transfer Addendum for a period ending the later of [***] or [***], and provided SutroVax commits to [***] or [***].\n\n2.16 Other Extracts. From time-to-time, subject to an agreed-upon Work Order, SutroVax may place purchase orders for quantities of research grade extract derived from strains of E. Coli other than that set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto (each an \"Other Extract\"). Sutro shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to accept such purchase orders (and shall accept such purchase orders placed consistent with an agreed-upon Work Order) and manufacture and supply to SutroVax such Other Extracts. For the purpose of calculating the Price for Other Extracts in accordance with this Section, the Price will be the cost of materials and Sutro's labor at an FTE rate of [***] per year for Sutro laboratory scientists. Upon Sutro's acceptance of a purchase order for Other Extract, such Other Extract in such purchase order shall be deemed Extract for purposes of Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4.1 (solely with respect to the last two sentences thereof), 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9.1 , 3.1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9.\n\n2.17 Manufacture of Custom Reagents. For clarity, SutroVax may Manufacture Custom Reagents itself or obtain supply thereof through a Third Party independent of this Supply Agreement and nothing in this Supply Agreement is intended to restrict SutroVax from doing so. Upon SutroVax's request, and subject to the remainder of the terms of this Section 2.17, Sutro shall (a) transfer to SutroVax or a contract manufacturer designated by SutroVax (which contract manufacturer is reasonably acceptable to Sutro, the approval of which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditions or delayed by Sutro) as soon as reasonably practicable the process to Manufacture each Custom Reagent and the items of Sutro Know-How reasonably necessary for SutroVax or its designee to Manufacture each Custom Reagent, including cell lines, standard operating procedures, protocols, batch records, analytical method standard operating procedures and analytical method transfer protocols and (b) make Sutro Personnel reasonably available to SutroVax or its designee for scientific and technical explanations and on-site support that may reasonably be requested by SutroVax or its designee to Manufacture the Custom Reagents; provided however, that SutroVax shall fully reimburse Sutro for all documented time spent by Sutro's personnel to perform such transfer (on an FTE basis, each such FTE charged at an annual rate of [***]) and out-of-pocket costs incurred by Sutro in connection with all of the activities under the preceding sub-clauses (a) and (b), in accordance with a budget reasonably approved in advance by SutroVax. Upon such SutroVax request, Sutro and SutroVax shall, within [***] days, agree on a scope of work for such transfer, including\n\n\n\n\n\nscale, timeline, estimated budget, and required materials; both parties shall use reasonable efforts to complete the transfer as soon as reasonably practical.

Sutro and SutroVax shall use reasonable efforts to resolve such disagreement as promptly as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout limiting the foregoing, Sutro and SutroVax shall discuss in good faith mutually acceptable testing procedures pursuant to which both Sutro and SutroVax will re-test a sample of the disputed Product to determine whether such Product meets the Required Standards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Sutro and SutroVax are unable to resolve such disagreement within [***] days of the date of the applicable rejection notice, either Party may submit a sample of the allegedly non-conforming Product for testing and a determination as to whether or not such Product conforms to the Required Standards to an independent testing organization, or to a consultant of recognized repute within the United States pharmaceutical industry, in either case mutually agreed upon by the Parties (such organization or consultant, the \"Laboratory\"), the appointment of which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed by either Party. The determination of the Laboratory with respect to all or part of any shipment of Product shall be final and binding upon the Parties. The fees and expenses of the Laboratory making such determination shall be borne by Sutro, in the event that the Laboratory determines that the Product was non-conforming and by SutroVax, in the event that the Laboratory determines that the Product did conform to the Required Standards.\n\n4.4 Return and Replacement of Non-Conforming Goods. Product that is either rejected by SutroVax as not meeting the Required Standards, or that is determined by the Laboratory not to meet such Required Standards, shall, [***], be returned by SutroVax to Sutro, or destroyed pursuant to Applicable Law, at Sutro's reasonable expense. Sutro shall replace any non-conforming Product(s) within the shortest possible time. SutroVax shall have no responsibility to Sutro for the amounts invoiced for non-conforming Product(s), and shall be credited for any amounts paid, but shall pay Sutro the applicable Price for the replacement Product(s) under the terms of Section 3.1.\n\nARTICLE 5 INSPECTION\n\n5.1 Right to Audit.

The terms and provisions of this Supply Agreement (which shall be the Discloser's Information of both Parties) and all other information and data, including all notes, books, papers, diagrams, documents, reports, e-mail, memoranda, visual observations, oral communications and all other data or information in whatever form, that one Party or any of its Affiliates or representatives supplies or otherwise makes available to the other Party or its Affiliates or representatives pursuant to this Supply Agreement shall be deemed Discloser's Information pursuant to Article 10 of the License Agreement.\n\nARTICLE 9 INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE\n\n9.1 Indemnification.\n\n9.1.1 Indemnification by Sutro. Sutro hereby agrees, at its sole cost and expense, to defend, hold harmless and indemnify, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, (collectively, \"Indemnify\") SutroVax and its Affiliates and their respective agents, directors, officers and employees of such Persons and the respective successors and assigns of any of the foregoing (the \"SutroVax Indemnitees\") from and against any and all liabilities, damages, penalties, fines, costs and expenses (including, reasonable attorneys' fees and other expenses of litigation) (collectively, \"Liabilities\") resulting from suits, claims, actions and demands, in each case brought by a Third Party (each, a \"Third-Party Claim\") against any SutroVax Indemnitee and arising from or occurring as a result of: [***]. Sutro's obligation to Indemnify the SutroVax Indemnitees pursuant to this Section 9.1.1 shall not apply to the extent that any such Liabilities are the result of a material breach by SutroVax of its obligations, representations, warranties or covenants under this Supply Agreement or the License Agreement or any SutroVax Indemnitee' s negligence or willful misconduct.\n\n9.1.2 Indemnification by SutroVax. SutroVax hereby agrees to Indemnify Sutro and its agents, directors, officers and employees and the respective successors and assigns of any of the foregoing (the \"Sutro lndemnitees\") from and against any and all Liabilities resulting from Third-Party Claims against any Sutro Indemnitee arising from or occurring as a result of: [***]. SutroVax's obligation to Indemnify the Sutro Indemnitees pursuant to this Section 9.1.2 shall not apply to the extent that any such Liabilities are the result of a material breach by Sutro of its obligations, representations, warranties or covenants under this Supply Agreement or the License Agreement or any Sutro Indemnitee's negligence or willful misconduct.\n\n\n\n\n\n9.1.3 Procedure. To be eligible to be Indemnified hereunder, the indemnified Person shall provide the indemnifying Party with prompt written notice of the Third-Party Claim giving rise to the indemnification obligation pursuant to this Section 9.1 and the right to control the defense (with the reasonable cooperation of the indemnified Person) or settlement any such claim; provided, however, that the indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement that admits fault, wrongdoing or damages without the indemnified Person's written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The indemnified Person shall have the right to join, but not to control, at its own expense and with counsel of its choice, the defense of any claim or suit that has been assumed by the indemnifying Party.\n\n9.2 Insurance. Each Party shall procure and maintain insurance, including clinical trials and product liability insurance, adequate to cover its obligations hereunder and consistent with normal business practices of prudent companies similarly situated at all times during which any Product or Vaccine Compositions is being clinically tested in human subjects or commercially distributed or sold by such Party. It is understood that such insurance shall not be construed to create a limit of either Party's liability or indemnification obligations under this Article 9, or that the maintenance of such insurance shall not be construed to relieve either Party of its other obligations under this Supply Agreement. Each Party shall provide the other with written evidence of such insurance upon request. Each Party shall provide the other with written notice at least [***] days prior to the cancellation, non renewal or material change in such insurance.\n\n9.3 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. EXCEPT (I) WITH RESPECT TO ANY BREACH OF ARTICLE 8 (CONFIDENTIALITY), (II) FOR THIRD PARTY PENALTIES, COSTS AND EXPENSES AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 2.9, OR (III) FOR [***], TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, (A) NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, WHETHER LIABILITY IS ASSERTED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER THEORY OR FORM OF ACTION, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF; AND (B) EACH PARTY'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY UNDER THIS SUPPLY AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED [***]. SUTRO'S LIABITY TO SUTROVAX FOR THIRD PARTY PENALTIES, COSTS AND EXPENSES UNDER SECTION 2.9 SHALL NOT EXCEED [***].\n\nARTICLE 10 TERM AND TERMINATION\n\n10.1 Term. The term of this Supply Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date first set forth above and shall remain in effect until the later of (a) July 31, 2021 or (b) the date that the Parties enter into the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement and Sutro is supplying to SutroVax each Product under the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement (the \"Term\"), unless it is terminated earlier in accordance with Section 10.2.\n\n10.2 Termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Supply Agreement, this Supply Agreement may be terminated:\n\n10.2.1 in its entirety or with respect to one or more Products, on a Product-by-Product basis, by mutual written consent of Sutro and SutroVax;\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.2 in its entirety by a Party if the other Party materially breaches any of the material terms, conditions or agreements contained in this Supply Agreement to be kept, observed or performed by the other Party, by giving the Party who committed the breach [***] days' prior written notice, unless the notified Party shall have cured the breach within such [***]-day period; and\n\n10.2.3 in its entirety or with respect to one or more Products, on a Product-by-Product basis, by SutroVax upon [***] days' prior written notice to Sutro for any reason.\n\n10.3 Effects of Termination. Upon the expiration of the Term or termination of this Supply Agreement, in its entirety or with respect to one or more Products, this Supply Agreement shall, except as otherwise provided in this Section 10.3 or Section 10.5, be of no further force or effect; provided, however, that (a) in the event this Supply Agreement is terminated by SutroVax pursuant to Section 10.2.3 and there are outstanding Work Orders or other purchase orders accepted by Sutro that would not be fulfilled as a result of such termination, SutroVax shall reimburse Sutro for all supplies and materials purchased by Sutro and time incurred by Sutro personnel (to the extent incurred solely for manufacture of Product for SutroVax) for the manufacture, or preparation for the manufacture, of Products for any Work Orders placed by SutroVax and any other purchase orders accepted by Sutro prior to such expiration or termination, in each case to the extent Sutro cannot otherwise reasonably mitigate such the costs and expenses of such supplies, materials and time (e.g., by use of resulting supplies, materials and work-in-progress Product for other purposes); provided that to the extent SutroVax pays for any supplies or materials, upon SutroVax's request Sutro shall promptly transfer and deliver such supplies and materials to SutroVax; and (b) if this Supply Agreement is terminated with respect to one or more Products, but not all Products, then this Supply Agreement shall continue in full force and effect with respect to the applicable Product(s) for which it is not terminated.\n\n10.4 Nonexclusive Remedy. Exercise of any right of termination afforded to either Party under this Supply Agreement (i) shall not prejudice any other legal rights or remedies either Party have against the other in respect of any breach of the terms and conditions of this Supply Agreement, and (ii) shall be without any obligation or liability arising from such termination other than such obligations expressly arising from termination of this Supply Agreement.\n\n10.5 Survival. Expiration of the Term or termination of this Supply Agreement (for any reason) shall not affect any accrued rights or liabilities of either Party. Article 4 (Product Testing), Article 5 (Inspection), Article 8 (Confidentiality), Article 9 (Indemnification and Insurance), Article 11 (Disputes), Article 12 (Miscellaneous), and Sections 2.2 (Transfer of Product), 2.14 (Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement), 2.15 (Qualification of Alternate Supplier), 2.17 (Manufacture of Custom Reagents), 3.3 (Recordkeeping), 3.4 (Taxes), 6.2 (Right of Reference; Drug Master Files), 6.3 (Recalls), 6.4 (Retention of Samples), 6.5 Regulatory Authority Inspections and Correspondence), 7.3 (Product Warranties), 7.4 (Disclaimer), 10.3 (Effects of Termination), 10.4 (Nonexclusive Remedy), and 10.5 (Survival) shall survive any expiration of the Term or termination of this Supply Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 11 DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n11.1 Principal Contacts. Each Party will appoint an individual employed by it to serve as its \"Principal Contact\" for purposes of this Supply Agreement. Either Party may from time to time replace its Principal Contact with a different employee, but unless required due to events beyond its control, neither Party will replace its Principal Contact without at least [***] days prior notice to the other Party. The two Principal Contacts shall communicate with each other regularly during the Term as the Parties may agree or as the Principal Contacts shall mutually determine to be useful.\n\n11.2 Escalation. The Parties intend that, to the maximum extent practicable, they shall reach decisions hereunder cooperatively through discussions among the Principal Contacts and by mutual consent of the Parties. In situations in which that does not occur, disputes or differences arising out of or in connection with this Supply Agreement shall initially be referred for review by the Parties' respective Senior Managements (as defined below). Such Senior Managements shall discuss the proposed dispute or difference, and shall meet with respect thereto if either of them believes a meeting or meetings are likely to be useful. If the Senior Managements do not resolve the dispute or difference within [***] days (or such lesser or longer period as they may agree is a useful period for their discussions), then either Party may pursue its other available remedies, consistent with this Supply Agreement. As used herein, Sutro's \"Senior Management\" means its then-current CEO, and SutroVax's \"Senior Management\" means its then-current CEO. For clarity, there shall be no obligation for any Disputed Matter arising out of Section 2.14 or 2.15 to be referred to the Senior Management to review prior to such matters being resolved by arbitration pursuant to Sections 11.3 and 11.4.\n\n11.3 Arbitration. If the Senior Managements are not able to resolve such dispute referred to them under Section 11.2 within such [***] day period, then such dispute shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration as follows: The Parties shall select a mutually agreeable arbitrator who has significant relevant experience in the subject matter of the disputed issue and no affiliation or pre-existing relationship with either Party. If the Parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within [***] days after the end of the [***] day period referred in Section 11.2 (or with respect to a Disputed Matter described in Section 11.4, after referral by a Party of such Disputed Matter to arbitration), either Party may request the Judicial and Mediation Services (\"JAMS\") in San Francisco, CA to appoint an arbitrator on behalf of the Parties in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of JAMS, and the proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with JAMS rules. The arbitrator may decide any issue as to whether, or as to the extent to which, any dispute is subject to the arbitration and other dispute resolution provisions in this Supply Agreement. The arbitrator must base the award on the provisions of this Supply Agreement and must render the award in a writing which must include an explanation of the reasons for such award. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's fees and expenses shall be shared equally by the Parties, unless the arbitrator in the award assesses such fees and expenses against one of the Parties or allocates such fees and expenses other than equally between the Parties. Each Party shall bear and pay its own expenses incurred in connection with any dispute resolution under this Section 11.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party shall have the right, without waiving any right or remedy available to such Party under this Supply Agreement or otherwise, to seek and obtain from any court of competent jurisdiction any interim or provisional relief that is necessary or desirable to protect the rights or property of such Party, pending the selection of the arbitrator hereunder or pending the arbitrator's decision of the dispute subject to arbitration.\n\n\n\n\n\n11.4 Baseball Arbitration. In the event (a) the Parties do not enter into a Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement as described in Section 2.14 or (b) the Parties do not enter into a Transfer Addendum as described in Section 2.15 (\"Disputed Matter\"), then upon either Party's request with respect to the Disputed Matter in clause (a) or SutroVax's request with respect to the Disputed Matter in clause (b), such Disputed Matter shall be resolved by binding arbitration conducted pursuant to Section 11.3, except that the procedures for the conduct of such arbitration shall be as follows:\n\n11.4.1 Each Party shall provide the arbitrator and the other Party with a written report setting forth its position with respect to the substance of such Disputed Matter and a full draft Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement or Transfer Addendum, as applicable, and may submit a revised report, position and draft Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement or Transfer Addendum, as applicable, to the arbitrator within [***] days of receiving the other Party's report and draft Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement or Transfer Addendum, as applicable. If so requested by the arbitrator, each Party shall make oral and/or other written submissions to the arbitrator in accordance with procedures to be established by the arbitrator; provided that other Party shall have the right to be present during any oral submissions. The arbitrator shall select one of the Party's draft Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement or Transfer Addendum, as applicable, as his or her decision, based on what is most reasonable and equitable to each of the Parties under the circumstances and reflective of reasonable and customary terms in the biopharmaceutical industry for agreements of this type and most closely reflects the Parties' intent as expressed in this Supply Agreement and the License Agreement, and shall not have the authority to render any substantive decision other than to so select the draft Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement or Transfer Addendum, as applicable, of Sutro or SutroVax (as initially submitted, or as revised in accordance with the foregoing, as applicable). For clarity, it is understood that the Parties intend the arbitration under this Section 11.4 to be a \"baseball arbitration\" type proceeding; and the arbitrator may fashion such detailed procedures as the arbitrator considers appropriate to implement this intent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event shall the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement or Transfer Addendum contain any provision granting to SutroVax or its Affiliates or Sublicensees any right to obtain or use any Sutro Core Know-How.\n\n11.4.2 In any arbitration under this Section 11.4, the arbitrator and the Parties shall use their best efforts to resolve such Disputed Matter within [***] days after the selection of the arbitrator, or as soon thereafter as is practicable.\n\nARTICLE 12 MISCELLANEOUS\n\n12.1 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each Party shall bear its own costs, fees and expenses incurred by such Party in connection with this Supply Agreement.\n\n12.2 Licenses and Permits. Each Party shall, at its sole cost and expense, maintain in full force and affect all necessary licenses, permits, and other authorizations required by Applicable Law in order to carry out its duties and obligations hereunder.\n\n\n\n\n\n12.3 Force Majeure. No Party shall be liable for a failure or delay in performing any of its obligations under this Supply Agreement if, but only to the extent that such failure or delay is due to causes beyond the reasonable control of the affected Party, including: (a) acts of God; (b) fire, explosion, or unusually severe weather; (c) war, invasion, riot, terrorism, or other civil unrest; (d) governmental laws, orders, restrictions, actions, embargo or blockages; (e) national or regional emergency; (f) strikes or industrial disputes at a national level which directly impact the affected Party's performance under this Supply Agreement; or (g) other similar cause outside of the reasonable control of such Party (\"Force Majeure\"); provided that the Party affected shall promptly notify the other of the Force Majeure condition and shall use reasonable efforts to eliminate, cure or overcome any such causes and resume performance of its obligations as soon as possible. If the performance of any obligation of a Party under this Supply Agreement is delayed owing to such a Force Majeure for any continuous period of more than [***] days, the other Party shall have the right to terminate this Supply Agreement.\n\n12.4 Neither Party may assign or transfer this Supply Agreement, including by merger, operation of law, or otherwise, without the other Party's prior written consent (which shall not be withheld unreasonably) except each Party may assign this Supply Agreement without the other Party's consent in the case of assignment or transfer to a Third Party that succeeds to all or substantially all of the assigning Party's business and assets relating to the subject matter of this Supply Agreement, whether by sale, merger, operation of law or otherwise. Any attempted assignment by a Party in violation of this Section without the written consent of the other Party will be null and void. Except as above limited, this Supply Agreement is binding upon and will inure to the benefit of each of the Parties, its successors and assigns. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that a Party is acquired, the acquiring Party shall agree in writing to abide by the terms of this Supply Agreement. Sutro agrees that if it assigns the License Agreement to any successor as allowed under section 15.1 of the License Agreement, it will also assign to such successor this Supply Agreement in accordance with this Section 12.4.\n\n12.5 This Supply Agreement incorporates the Exhibits referenced herein. This Supply Agreement, together with the License Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties hereto with respect to its subject matter. To the extent of any conflict between this Agreement and the License Agreement, the License Agreement shall govern and control.\n\n12.6 All notices, requests or other communication provided for or permitted hereunder shall be given in writing and shall be hand delivered or sent by confirmed facsimile, reputable courier or by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to the address set forth below, or to such other address of which either Party may inform the other in writing. Notices will be deemed delivered on the earliest of transmission by facsimile, actual receipt or [***] days after mailing as described herein.\n\nIf to Sutro: Sutro Biopharma, Inc. 310 Utah Ave., Suite 150 South San Francisco, CA 94080 Attention: Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n\nIf to SutroVax: SutroVax, Inc. 353 Hatch Dr. Foster City, CA 94404 Attention: Chief Executive Officer\n\n12.7 This Supply Agreement may be amended, modified or waived only in a writing signed by the Party or Parties to be bound thereby.\n\n12.8 If any provision of this Supply Agreement shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law and the Parties' fundamental intentions hereunder, and the remaining provisions shall not be affected or impaired.\n\n12.9 Nothing herein contained shall constitute this a joint venture agreement and nothing herein shall constitute any Party as a partner, principal or agent of any other, this being an agreement between independent contracting entities. Except as expressly set forth herein, no Party shall have the authority to bind any other in any respect whatsoever to Third Parties. Except as provided herein, nothing contained in this Supply Agreement shall be construed as conferring any right on any Party to use any name, trade name, trademark or other designation of any other Party hereto, unless the express, written permission of such other Party has been obtained.\n\n12.10 This Supply Agreement has been submitted to the scrutiny of, and has been negotiated by, both Parties and their counsel, and shall be given a fair and reasonable interpretation in accordance with its terms, without consideration or weight being given to any such term's having been drafted by any Party or its counsel.\n\n12.11 This Supply Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, without regard to any conflict of laws rules to the contrary.\n\n12.12 Each Party acknowledges that the other Party may likely suffer irreparable harm from such Party's breach or threatened breach of this Agreement and the other Party, in such cases, would therefore be entitled, without waiving any other right or remedy available to, to injunctive relief (including specific performance) without the requirement to post a bond, provided the waiver by such Party of the other Party's requirement to post a bond shall expire on the Change of Control of the other Party, and each party agrees that the arbitrator selected under Section 11.3 shall have the power to grant such injunctive relief (or order specific performance). The Parties shall comply with any such injunctive relief (including specific performance) ordered by the arbitrator and agree that such order may, to the extent not precluded by applicable law, be enforceable as a final award in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n12.13 This Supply Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Facsimile and other electronically scanned signatures shall have the same effect as their originals.\n\n[The remainder of this page is left intentionally blank]\n\n\n\n\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Supply Agreement to be executed by their respective duly authorized officers as of the Effective Date, each copy of which will for all purposes be deemed to be an original.

This limitation is separate and independent of any other remedy limitations and shall not fail if any such other limitation fails. The foregoing shall not be deemed to modify or limit any rights or remedies to the extent arising under the SDA, any other Ancillary Agreement or any Excluded Agreement.\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE VIII\n\nGOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n8.1 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any conflict or choice-of-law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. 8.2 Alternative Dispute Resolution. Any dispute, controversy or claim between or among the Parties (whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise) arising out of or resulting from this Agreement, including the meaning of its provisions or the performance of any such provisions by a Party, its breach, termination, invalidity or otherwise (each, a \"Dispute\") will be resolved in accordance with the procedures specified in this Article VIII, which will be the sole and exclusive procedure for the resolution of any such Dispute. 8.2.1 Negotiations. The Parties will attempt in good faith to resolve any Dispute promptly by negotiations among executives of the Parties who have authority to settle the Dispute. The disputing Party will give the other Party or Parties, as applicable, written notice of the Dispute. Within twenty (20) days after receipt of said notice, the receiving Party or Parties will submit to the other a written response. The notice and response will include: (a) a statement of each Party's position and a summary of the evidence and arguments supporting that position, and (b) the name and title of the executive who will represent that Party. The executives will meet at a mutually acceptable time and place within thirty (30) days of the date of the disputing Party's notice and thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary to exchange relevant information and to attempt to resolve the Dispute. 8.2.2 Arbitration. If a Dispute has not been resolved within sixty (60) days of the date of the disputing Party's notice, any Party desiring a non-negotiated resolution shall refer the Dispute to binding arbitration pursuant to the then-current commercial arbitration rules and supplementary procedures of commercial arbitration of the American Arbitration Association (the \"AAA Rules\"). The arbitral tribunal shall be composed of a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the AAA Rules in any matter in which an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief is not requested and the value of the relief any Party seeks (whether by claim or counterclaim) does not exceed three million United States dollars (US $3,000,000).

Except with the prior written consent of the other Party or Parties in the Dispute, as applicable, none of the Parties will disclose the existence or content of the Dispute, or the results of any\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\ndispute resolution process, to third parties other than (a) as may be required by law or legal process after having provided the other Party or Parties with notice thereof and the opportunity to seek a protective order over such information, or (b) to outside counsel and tax, financial, and accounting professionals in connection with the Dispute. 8.4 Equitable Relief. The Parties acknowledge and agree that monetary damages (even if available) may not be an adequate remedy in the event that a Party does not perform the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with their specified terms or otherwise breaches any provisions of this Agreement. Accordingly, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any Party will be entitled to seek from the arbitrator or arbitration tribunal, and the arbitrator or arbitration tribunal will be empowered to grant, an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief (whether preliminary, permanent, temporary, conservatory or otherwise, and including temporary restraining orders) to prevent such breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which such Party is entitled at law or in equity. The Party alleging the breach shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such award, but the Parties reserve all rights to otherwise contest the propriety of any award of injunctive relief. In addition, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any Party will be entitled to seek in a court of competent jurisdiction an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement pending an arbitration under Section 8.2.2.

The waiver by any Party to this Agreement of a breach of any term or provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach. No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Subject to Section 3.3, the rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n9.5 Notice.

Such royalty payment shall be payable to Pfizer within thirty (30) days of the end of each Calendar Quarter. Royalty payments shall be determined by multiplying the Laboratory Services Revenue and the applicable royalty rate from the chart below. Cumulative Incremental Laboratory Services Revenue during the Term Applicable Royalty Rate If < $200 million 0% If > $200 million and < $400 million 1% If > $400 million and < $600 million 2% If > $600 million 3% 49\n\nSource: EXACT SCIENCES CORP, 8-K, 8/22/2018\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if the cumulative Incremental Laboratory Services Revenue achieved during the Term is $500 million, the applicable royalty rate is 2%.

Thereafter, the Parties will use good faith efforts to agree to the Advertising services that will be provided by Pfizer during the Tail Period in accordance with Section 3.2(d) and Exhibit 8.8(b).

WHEREAS, Buyer, Gulf Houghton and other shareholders of the Company are parties to a Share Purchase Agreement dated as of April 4, 2017, under which Buyer is acquiring the Shares (the \"Purchase Agreement\").

WHEREAS, Sellers, together with the Company, have been substantially involved in and with the Company's operations and management and possess trade secrets and other confidential information relating to the Company Business and the Company's clients, customers, vendors, suppliers and operations. WHEREAS, it is integral to Buyer's acquisition of the Company Business and a condition precedent to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement that the Sellers enter into this Agreement with Buyer to provide for the protection of the Combined Business's customer and vendor relationships, trade secrets, confidential information and other business operations. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Gulf Houghton shall receive cash consideration and shares of Buyer's capital stock in exchange for the Shares owned by Gulf Houghton and as inducement for Gulf Houghton and the other Sellers to enter into this Agreement. NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and in the Purchase Agreement, the parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 1. Confidentiality; Non-competition; Non-solicitation. (a) From and after the date hereof, each Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, hold, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its or their respective Representatives to hold, in confidence any and all information, whether written or oral, concerning Buyer, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, except to the extent that such Seller can show that such information: (i) is generally available to and known by the public through no fault of any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives or (ii) is lawfully acquired by such Seller, any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives from and after the date hereof from sources that are not prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation. If any Seller or any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives are compelled to disclose any information by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Law, such Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing and shall disclose only that portion of such information that such Seller is advised by its counsel is legally required to be disclosed, provided that such Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such information.\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending two years after the Closing Date (the \"Non- Compete Period\"), it shall not, other than solely through its direct or indirect ownership of Buyer's capital stock or any other interests in Buyer, directly, or indirectly, including through or on behalf of a subsidiary, anywhere in the world, excluding India: (i) own, manage, operate or control any business which competes with any Combined Business or (ii) be or become a shareholder, partner, member or owner of any Person who is engaged in any Combined Business; provided, however that nothing in this Agreement shall: (i) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from owning, as a passive investor, not more than five (5%) percent collectively and in the aggregate of any class of outstanding publicly traded securities of any Person so engaged; (ii) prohibit or restrict any Seller, directly or indirectly, from engaging in such Seller's business as conducted on the Effective Date and reasonable extensions thereof, which may include routine, day-to-day transactions with any entity, and (iii) apply to or restrict any business of which a Seller acquires control after the Effective Date provided that the acquired business did not receive more than $25,000,000 of its aggregate net sales (as measured during the 12 full calendar months prior to such acquisition) from product lines included within the definition of Company Business. Each Seller agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its duration, geographical area and scope. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"control\" (including the terms \"controlled by\" and \"under common control with\") means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. (c) Gulf Oil and Gulf India each agree during the Non-Compete Period not to acquire, directly or indirectly, control of any businesses involved in, or otherwise competing with, the business of the Combined Business from any entity on Schedule 1 hereto. (d) Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending three years after the Closing Date (the \"Non-Solicit Period\"), each Seller shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) induce, solicit, recruit or attempt to persuade any employee of the Combined Business to terminate his or her employment with the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) solicit the employment of any of the employees of the Combined Business. Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by means of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nemployees of the Combined Business; provided, however, that this clause (2) shall not permit any Seller to hire any such employees during the Non-Solicit Period. (e) It is the intention of the parties that the covenants contained in this Section 1 shall be enforced to the greatest extent (but to no greater extent) in time, area and degree of participation as is permitted by the Law of that jurisdiction whose Law is applicable to any acts allegedly in breach of such covenants. To this end, the parties agree that the covenants contained in this Section 1 shall be construed to extend in time and territory and with respect to degree of participation only so far as they may be enforced in such jurisdiction, and that the covenants contained in this Section 1 are to that end hereby declared divisible and severable. It being the purpose of this Section 1 to govern competition by the Sellers and their respective subsidiaries, the non-competition covenants contained in this Section 1 shall be governed by and construed according to the Law of all the jurisdictions in which competition in breach of this Agreement is alleged to have occurred or to be threatened that best gives them effect. 2.

Injunctive Relief; Attorneys Fees. Each Seller agrees that in the event of a breach of this Agreement, the damage to Buyer will be inestimable and that therefore any remedy at Law or in monetary damages shall be inadequate. Accordingly, the parties agree that Buyer shall, in addition to monetary damages incurred by reason of any such breach or potential breach, without the necessity of posting any bond or similar instrument (and Sellers hereby irrevocably waive any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument) be entitled to seek injunctive relief (including specific performance) against the Sellers for breach of this Agreement. If any action or proceeding shall be commenced to enforce this Agreement or any right arising in connection with this Agreement, the prevailing party in such action or proceeding shall be entitled to recover from the other party the reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and expenses incurred by such prevailing party in connection with such action or proceeding. 6.

Any such waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\nspecific matter described in such writing and shall in no way impair the rights of the party granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other time. Neither the waiver by a party of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of this Agreement, nor the failure by any party, on one or more occasions, to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any right or privilege hereunder, shall be construed as a waiver of any other breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder.

Each HOF Entity agrees, on a several but not joint basis, to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Constellation, and its shareholders, partners, officers, directors, employees, successors, assigns, representatives, servants and agents (collectively, the \"Constellation Indemnified Persons\") from and against, and the HOF Entities waive any claim for contribution or indemnity against any Constellation Indemnified Person with respect to, any and all Indemnified Losses resulting from or arising out of (i) the use or display by Constellation of HOF Entity Marks as permitted by this Agreement or (ii) any breach by such HOF Entity of its representations, warranties and/or obligations under this Agreement. (c) Notice of Claim. In the event that an HOF Entity seeks indemnification on behalf of an HOF Entity Indemnified Person, or Constellation seeks indemnification on behalf of a Constellation Indemnified Person, such Party seeking indemnification (the \"Indemnified Party\") shall give reasonably prompt notice to the indemnifying Party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") specifying the facts constituting the basis for such claim and the amount, to the extent known, of the claim asserted; provided, however, that the right of a person or entity to be indemnified hereunder shall not be adversely affected by a failure to give such notice unless, and then only to the extent that, any Indemnifying Party is actually irrevocably and materially prejudiced thereby. Subject to the terms hereof, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of any valid claim not more than ten (10) days after the Indemnified Party provides notice to the Indemnifying Party of such amount.\n\n11\n\nSource: GPAQ ACQUISITION HOLDINGS, INC., S-4/A, 1/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Right to Contest Claims of Third Persons. If an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder because of a claim asserted by any claimant (other than a Constellation Indemnified Person or HOF Entity Indemnified Person) (a \"Third Person\"), the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt notice thereof after such assertion is actually known to the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the right of a person or entity to be indemnified hereunder in respect of claims made by a Third Person shall not be adversely affected by a failure to give such notice unless, and then only to the extent that, an Indemnifying Party is actually irrevocably and materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, and using counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, to investigate, contest or settle the claim alleged by such Third Person (a \"Third Person Claim\"), provided that the Indemnifying Party has unconditionally acknowledged to the Indemnified Party in writing its obligation to indemnify the persons and entities to be indemnified hereunder with respect to such Third Person Claim and to discharge (and does in fact so discharge) any cost or expense arising out of such investigation, contest or settlement. The Indemnified Party may thereafter participate in (but not control) the defense of any such Third Person Claim with its own counsel at its own expense, unless separate representation is necessary to avoid a conflict of interest, in which case such representation shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. Unless and until the Indemnifying Party so acknowledges its obligation to indemnify, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its option, to assume and control defense of the matter and to look to the Indemnifying Party for the full amount of the reasonable costs of defense. The failure of the Indemnifying Party to respond in writing to the aforesaid notice of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Person Claim within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof shall be deemed an irrevocable election not to defend the same. If the Indemnifying Party does not so acknowledge its obligation to indemnify and assume the defense of any such Third Person Claim, (i) the Indemnified Party may defend against such claim using counsel of its choice, in such manner as it may reasonably deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, settling such claim, after giving notice of the same to the Indemnifying Party, on such terms as the Indemnified Party may reasonably deem appropriate, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party may participate in (but not control) the defense of such action, with its own counsel at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party thereafter seeks to question the manner in which the Indemnified Party defended such Third Person Claim or the amount or nature of any such settlement, the Indemnifying Party shall have the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that conduct of the Indemnified Party in the defense and/or settlement of such Third Person Claim constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Parties shall make available to each other all relevant information in their possession relating to any such Third Person Claim and shall cooperate in the defense thereof.

If the Village is damaged by fire, earthquake, act of God, the elements or other casualty or is condemned by an authority exercising the powers of eminent domain or the Village is transferred in lieu of the exercise of such power so as to render the Village unusable for its intended purpose at any time during the Term, then the HOF Entities shall have the option, but not the obligation, to repair the damage or loss. The HOF Entities shall notify Constellation as to whether the HOF Entities shall effect such repair and restoration within thirty (30) days after the casualty. If the HOF Entities notify Constellation that the HOF Entities are electing to effect such repairs and restoration, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect; provided, however, that the Term shall be extended by such number of days as equals the length of the period from the date of the event until such repairs and restoration are complete. If the HOF Entities notify Constellation that the HOF Entities are electing not to effect such repairs and restoration, then this Agreement and all rights granted hereunder shall terminate as of the date of such fire or other casualty. (b) Other. Except as otherwise set forth herein, neither Party shall be liable or responsible for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder, which failure is caused or brought about in any manner beyond the control of such Party, including, but not limited to, the breakdown or failure of apparatus, equipment, or machinery employed in its supply of said services, any temporary stoppage for the repair, improvement or enlargement thereof, or any other act or condition beyond its reasonable control, other than such Party's inability to perform payment obligations.\n\n14\n\nSource: GPAQ ACQUISITION HOLDINGS, INC., S-4/A, 1/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Tolling. In the event that, after the construction and development of the Village has been substantially completed, the Village is not usable for a period of at least thirty (30) days as a result of the events described under this Section 6.7 and unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Term shall be extended for that period of time (after substantial completion) which the Village was not usable and the start and end dates of each period shall be adjusted to reflect the number of days (after substantial completion) in which the Village was not usable for all purposes of this Agreement, including without limitation the expiration date of the Term. 6.8 Not a Lease or License of the Village. This Agreement will not constitute a lease or license of any part of the Village. It will represent solely a contractual obligation of the HOF Entities to provide to Constellation certain other benefits hereunder. 6.9 Insurance. Constellation shall, at its own expense, secure and maintain in full force and effect throughout the Term (a) insurance coverage for defamation, trademark and service mark infringement, unfair competition, copyright infringement, and infringement of a person's right of publicity and right of privacy from a carrier with an A.M.

In the event that either Party or any of its representatives becomes legally compelled to disclose any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement, such Party shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, provide the other Party with prompt written notice before such disclosure, sufficient to enable such other Party either to seek a protective order, at its expense, or another appropriate remedy preventing or prohibiting such disclosure or to waive compliance with the provisions of this Section, or both. 6.11 Press Releases. The HOF Entities and Constellation shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or scheduling any press conference or conference call with media members or other third parties with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The HOF Entities and Constellation shall mutually agree on the content of any such press release prior to its publication. 6.12 No Defamation or Disparagement.

The headings used in this Agreement are solely for convenience and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of the provisions set forth herein. 6.15 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, and on separate counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 6.16 Waiver. No action, other than a notice by a Party to another Party specifically stating that such notice has the effect of waiver, shall constitute a waiver of any particular breach or default of such other Party. No such waiver notice from a Party shall waive any other Party's failure to fully comply with any other term, condition, or provision of this Agreement, irrespective of any knowledge any HOF Entity or Constellation officer, manager, employee, or agent may have of any breach or default of, or noncompliance with, such other term, condition, or provision. No waiver of full performance by a Party shall be construed, or operate, as a waiver of any subsequent default of any of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Agreement. The payment or acceptance of fees or charges for any period after a default shall not be deemed a waiver of any right or acceptance of defective performance. 6.17 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be contrary to law and unenforceable by any court of law, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. 6.18 Third Party Beneficiaries.

Availability Credits If in any month during the term of Managed Hosting Services the Monthly Availability Percentage for a Qualifying Server is less than the SLA Target Percentage for that Qualifying Server, Customer shall be eligible to receive an Availability Credit, subject to Section 8.3(b), 8.4, 8.5, 8.6 and 8.7. If in any month during the term of Managed Hosting Services the Monthly Availability Percentage for Basic Monitoring or Advanced Monitoring Services is less than the SLA Target Percentage for Basic Monitoring or Advanced Monitoring Services, Customer shall be eligible to receive an Availability Credit, subject to Section 8.3(b), 8.4, 8.5, 8.6 and 8.7. Customer agrees to contact the IBM Help Desk to report problems and open trouble tickets that reflect the start time of the Outage event. Settlement of Credits Availability Credits will be aggregated on a quarterly basis and settled by the last day of the first month following the end of the quarter in which such Availability Credits were earned. (For example, the aggregate Availability Credits earned in the first quarter 2007 will be applied against Monthly Recurring Charge for Services the Customer incurs in the April 2007 invoice.) Any Availability Credits owed from IBM to Customer upon the expiration or termination of the Services will be paid within one (1) month following the effective date of expiration or termination. If the Monthly Recurring Charge for a subject month has not been incurred, or for any other reason has been credited or waived, Customer shall not be eligible for an Availability Credit for that month. Customer shall receive no more than five percent (5%) of Customer's Monthly Recurring Charge for Managed Hosting Services as an Availability Credit in a given month. Commencement of Service Level Agreement IBM will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to meet the SLA Target Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer shall not be eligible for an Availability Credit until the first full calendar month following the Hosting Service Ready Date. Exclusivity of Remedies Customer agrees that its sole remedy for IBM's failure to meet an SLA Target Percentage is the Availability Credit as provided in this Attachment.

Any limitations on the quantities to be received from each Point of Receipt and/or delivered to each Point of Delivery shall be as specified on Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto.   1.2 EQUIVALENT QUANTITY - shall be as defined in Article I of the General Terms and Conditions of Transporter's FERC Gas Tariff.   ARTICLE II - TRANSPORTATION   Transportation Service - Transporter agrees to accept and receive daily on a firm basis, at the Point(s) of Receipt from Shipper or for Shipper's account such quantity of gas as Shipper makes available up to the Transportation Quantity, and to deliver to or for the account of Shipper to the Point(s) of Delivery an Equivalent Quantity of gas.

The arbitration will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1 et seq. Arbitration awards will be final and binding upon the Parties, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The place of the arbitration will be Chicago, Illinois. All aspects of the arbitration and any award will be confidential (subject to the exceptions set forth in Section 19.3).\n\n(c) The arbitrators will have the authority to grant any equitable and legal remedies that would be available in any judicial proceeding instituted to resolve a dispute; provided, however, that the arbitrators will have no power or authority to award damages that would be inconsistent with Section 23 of this Agreement.\n\n(d) In any arbitration under this Section 28.9, the arbitrators will set a limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing each Party to such dispute an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrators, to discover relevant information from the other Party about the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrators will rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and will have the authority to impose sanctions for discovery abuses, including attorneys' fees and costs, to the same extent as a competent court of law or equity, should the arbitrators determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification.\n\n(e) Each Party will pay its own costs and expenses (including counsel fees) of any arbitration; provided, however, that the Parties will equally share the fees and expenses of the arbitrators; provided, further, that in the event any action, suit, arbitration, or other proceeding is instituted or commenced by either Party against the other Party arising hereunder, the prevailing Party will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and costs of arbitration from the non-prevailing Party (it being agreed that the arbitrators and/or judge may eliminate or reduce such recovery on the grounds that it is unreasonable or disproportionate to the harm suffered). 32\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 28.9 to the contrary, either Party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other interim or conservatory relief, as necessary.

EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF. THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL- ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS.\n\n28.11 Equitable Relief. Each Party acknowledges that a breach by a Party of this Agreement may cause the non-breaching Party immediate and irreparable harm, for which an award of damages may not be adequate compensation and agrees that notwithstanding Section 28.9(b), in the event of such breach or threatened breach, the non-breaching Party will be entitled to seek equitable relief, including in the form of orders for preliminary or permanent injunction, specific performance, and any other relief that may be available from any court of competent jurisdiction or the arbitration panel, provided that following the formation of the arbitration panel pursuant to Section 28.9(b), such relief will only be sought from the arbitration panel. The Parties hereby waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such relief. Such remedies will not be deemed to be exclusive but will be in addition to all other remedies available under this Agreement, at law or in equity, subject to any express exclusions or limitations in this Agreement to the contrary.\n\n28.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.

If the weighted average sale price cannot be determined for the Product or other product(s) containing the single licensed compound or component(s), the calculation of Net Sales for Combination Products will be agreed by the Parties based on the relative value contributed by each component (each Party's agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\n1.44 \"Party\" means Array or Ono, individually; and \"Parties\" means Array and Ono, collectively.\n\n1.45 \"Patent(s)\" means any patents and patent applications, together with all additions, divisions, continuations, continuations-in-part, substitutions, reissues, re-examinations, registrations, patent term extensions, supplemental protection certificates, and renewals of any of the foregoing.\n\n1.46 \"Ono Know-How\" means all scientific, medical, technical, marketing, regulatory, market access and other information (including clinical data and other related information generated in compliance with CDISC standards) relating to Binimetinib, Encorafenib and/or a Product (including the Data), that (a) exists as of the Effective Date or is developed, acquired or otherwise comes within the Control of Ono during the term of this Agreement and (b) in each case is actually used by Ono in the Development, Manufacturing or Commercialization of a Product, and is needed by or reasonably useful to Array in order for Array to exercise its rights (including the conduct of activities directed towards Developing the Product for Commercialization outside the Ono Territory and/or the Commercialization of the Product outside the Ono Territory) or perform its obligations under this Agreement.

In the event that the Commercializing Party does not agree to reimburse or does not promptly reimburse the Sublicensing Party for such amounts upon request (such amounts as determined by the JDRC in accordance with this Agreement, to the extent so provided above), then such Third Party Technology shall thereafter be deemed excluded from the licenses or other subject matter licensed hereunder.\n\n(b) Right to Offset.

Ono shall carry out all such activities in accordance with the then-current Development Plan and the provisions of this Agreement.\n\n4.4 Joint Clinical Studies.\n\n(a)  Joint Clinical Study Proposals. From time to time during the term of this Agreement, either Party may submit to the JDRC a proposal for one or more joint Clinical Studies that would support the filing of Marketing Approval Applications for the Product with Regulatory Authorities in both the Ono Territory and the Array Territory (a \"Joint Clinical Study Proposal\"). Each such Joint Clinical Study Proposal shall include a draft synopsis, proposed timelines for the conduct of such studies, as well a proposed budget for such studies. The JDRC shall review and discuss each such Joint Clinical Study Proposal and shall approve or reject such Joint Clinical Study Proposal in its discretion.\n\n(i) If the JDRC approves a Joint Clinical Study Proposal, such Joint Clinical Study Proposal shall thereafter be deemed to be an \"Approved Clinical Study\" and the JDRC will create a Working Group to prepare a full development plan (\"Joint Development Plan\") covering the Approved Clinical Study based on the Joint Clinical Study Proposal. Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, if such Approved Clinical Study(ies) are Global Registration Studies, then the cost of such Approved Clinical Study(ies) (including out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Parties together with FTE-costs associated with the Parties' personnel managing such Approved Clinical Study) shall be allocated eighty eight percent (88%) to Array and twelve percent (12%) to Ono.\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\n(ii) In the event that the JDRC does not approve the Joint Clinical Study Proposal (or a substantially similar proposal) within sixty (60) days after such Joint Clinical Study Proposal has been submitted to the JDRC, the each Party shall be free to carry out at its own expense the relevant Clinical Study(ies) described in such Joint Clinical Study Proposal independently, subject to the terms of Sections 2.1 and 4.4(c).\n\n(b) Joint Development Plans. Pursuant to Section 4.4(a), the Working Group designated by JDRC shall in good faith discuss and prepare the Joint Development Plan covering Approved Clinical Study(ies) for review by JDRC.\n\n(i) Once Joint Development Plan prepared by the Working Group is approved at JDRC, the Parties shall initiate the Approved Clinical Study(ies) in accordance with the Joint Development Plan.\n\n(ii) In the event that the JDRC is unable to agree upon a Joint Development Plan for such Approved Clinical Study within sixty (60) days after the applicable Joint Study Proposal has been approved by the JDRC, each Party shall be free to carry out such Approved Clinical Study(ies) at its own expense independently upon notice to the other Party, and subject to the terms of Sections 2.1 and 4.4(c).\n\n(iii) The JDRC shall review the Joint Development Plan on an ongoing basis from time-to-time as needed. The JDRC may make adjustments to the then-current Joint Development Plan from time-to-time as it deems appropriate.\n\n(c)  Consequences of Rejection of Joint Clinical Study Proposals or Joint Development Plan.\n\n(i) In case of the rejection of a Joint Clinical Proposal by the JDRC pursuant to Section 4.4(a)(ii) or the inability of the Parties to agree upon a Joint Development Plan for an Approved Clinical Study as described in Section 4.4(b)(ii), each Party may, upon notice to the other Party, conduct the relevant Clinical Study described in the Joint Clinical Study Proposal (hereinafter the \"Declined Clinical Study\") at its own expense, subject to Section 2.1 above; provided, however, that:\n\n(A) any Declined Clinical Study conducted by Ono (or its Affiliates or Sublicensees) shall be conducted solely within the Ono Territory;\n\n(B) each Party, should it elect to conduct any Declined Clinical Study on its own shall keep the JDRC and the other Party informed as to the design of any such Declined Clinical Study(ies) to be conducted by or under its authority;\n\n(C) any Declined Clinical Study conducted by Array or PFM shall be permitted to include clinical sites within the Ono Territory to the extent consistent with the requirements of Section 4.5;\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\n(D) if the Party that is not conducting a Declined Clinical Study (the \"Non-Performing Party\") determines reasonably and in good faith that the Declined Clinical Study is reasonably likely to adversely affect the Development or Commercialization of the Products in the Field, then the Party performing such Declined Clinical Study (the \"Performing Party\") shall not undertake such Declined Clinical Study unless and until the JDRC determines that such Declined Clinical Study should be permitted; and\n\n(E) The Performing Party shall provide formal written reports of the results of the Declined Clinical Study and the costs of such Declined Clinical to the Non-Performing Party when such written reports are available, and the JDRC during meetings of the JDRC, upon request of the other Party but not more than twice a year during the period in which any study within the Declined Clinical Study is being performed. For clarity, Section 18.11 shall apply with respect to Declined Clinical Studies undertaken by either Party in accordance with this Section 4.4(c).\n\n(ii) Costs of Declined Clinical Studies and Use of related Data. The Performing Party shall bear all costs associated with Declined Clinical Studies it undertakes. If Ono (or an Ono Affiliate or Sublicensee) submits to a Regulatory Authority in Ono Territory Data generated by Array (including its Affiliates) or a Third Party Partner pursuant to a Declined Clinical Study (either directly or by reference under Section 4.8 below) for purposes of obtaining new or expanded Marketing Approval for the Product for the same Indication that was the subject of study in such Declined Clinical Study, Ono shall reimburse Array an amount equal to [ * ] of the costs incurred by Array (including by its Affiliates) and/or such Third Party Partner for the Declined Clinical Study. If Array (including its Affiliates) and/or PFM submits to a Regulatory Authority in the Array Territory Data generated by Ono pursuant to a Declined Clinical Study (either directly or by reference under Section 4.8 below) for purposes of obtaining new or expanded Marketing Approval for the Product for the same Indication that was the subject of study in such Declined Clinical Study, Array shall reimburse Ono an amount equal to [ * ] of the costs incurred by Ono (including by its Affiliates) for the Declined Clinical Study. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Ono is the Non-Performing Party and the PMDA (or MHLW), based on the fact that the Declined Clinical Study utilized clinical sites in Japan, compels Ono to file for a new or expanded Marketing Approval for the Product based on the Data generated by Array pursuant to a Declined Clinical Study, then the foregoing obligation to reimburse Array [ * ] of the costs of the Declined Clinical Study shall be waived.\n\n(d) Except for Investigator Sponsored Clinical Studies included in the Existing Clinical Studies, neither Party shall authorize or support an Investigator Sponsored Clinical Study or any Post-Approval Marketing Clinical Study in the other Party's territory without obtaining prior written consent.\n\n(e) Development Efforts; Manner of Performance; Reports.\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\n(i) Development Efforts.

If Laws or regulations require withholding by Ono of any taxes imposed upon Array on account of any royalties or other payments paid under this Agreement, such taxes shall be deducted by Ono as required by Law from such payment and shall be paid by Ono to the proper taxing authorities. Ono shall use Diligent Efforts to secure official receipts of payment of any withholding tax and shall send them to Array as evidence of such payment. Array shall provide to Ono any taxation documents (Form 3 and Form 17), and the Residency Certificate of Array issued by the US Internal Revenue Service (which Residency Certificate is effective for three (3) years after its issuance to a public company) that may be reasonably necessary in order for Ono not to withhold tax or to withhold tax at a reduced rate under an applicable bilateral income tax treaty. Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties shall exercise their reasonable efforts to ensure that any withholding taxes imposed are reduced as far as possible under the provisions of any applicable tax treaty, and shall cooperate in filing any forms required for such reduction. Each Party shall cooperate with the other and furnish the other Party with appropriate documents to secure application of the most favorable rate of withholding tax under applicable Law (or exemption from such withholding tax payments, as applicable).\n\n(b) Sales Taxes. Any sales taxes (including any consumption tax or value added tax), use tax, transfer taxes, duties or similar governmental charges required to be paid in connection with the transfer to a Party of a Product (including for clarity, Drug Substance or Drug Product) produced by or on behalf of the supplying Party pursuant to this Agreement shall be the sole responsibility of the receiving Party.

Ono shall keep, and require its Affiliates and Sublicensees to keep, complete, true and accurate books of accounts and records for the purpose of determining the amounts payable to Array pursuant to this Agreement. Such books and records shall be kept for at least three (3) years following the end of the calendar quarter to which they pertain. Such records will be open for inspection during such three (3) year period by an independent certified public accounting firm of nationally (the US or Japan) recognized standing (the \"Auditor\"), chosen by Array and reasonably acceptable to Ono for the purpose of verifying the amounts payable by Ono hereunder. Such inspections may be made no more than once each Calendar Year, at reasonable times and on reasonable prior written notice. Such records for any particular calendar quarter shall be subject to no more than one inspection. The Auditor shall be obligated to execute a reasonable confidentiality agreement prior to commencing any such inspection. Inspections conducted under this Section 7.4 shall be at the expense of Array, unless a variation or error producing an underpayment in amounts payable exceeding [ * ] of the amount paid for a period covered by the inspection is established, in which case all reasonable costs relating to the inspection for such period and any unpaid amounts that are discovered shall be paid by Ono, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the rate set forth in Section 7.1 above. The Parties will endeavor in such inspection to minimize disruption of Ono's normal business activities to the extent reasonably practicable. For clarity, while Ono does not engage in the bundling of products as of the Effective Date, in the event that Ono elects in the future to provide a discount for the purchase of a bundle of products that includes a Product, or if its Affiliates or Sublicensees sell Product as part of said discounted bundle, such discount shall be allocated to Product, for purposes of this Agreement, based on the ratio, calculated on a quarterly basis, of Product sales to sales of all of Ono's products sold in the Ono Territory. It is understood that the foregoing audit rights shall include the right to have the Auditor verify Ono's compliance (and the compliance of its Affiliates and Sublicensees) with the above requirements.\n\nARTICLE VIII   CERTAIN COVENANTS\n\n8.1 Diligence Obligations.\n\n(a)  General Diligence Obligations.

For clarity, the forgoing supply obligations not apply to materials that are generally commercially available.\n\n9.3 Clinical Supply. The Parties shall establish as soon as practicable following the Effective Date procedures for the supply of Materials to Ono for use in performing Ono's Development activities under Development Plan and any Joint Development Plans that may subsequently be agreed to by the Parties, and the Parties shall enter into a clinical supply agreement and quality agreement within three (3) months of the Effective Date pursuant to which:\n\n(a) Array shall procure Materials on behalf of and as reasonably requested in writing by Ono, which Materials will be supplied to Ono at transfer price equal to: (i) Array's manufacturing cost to the extent that Array or its Affiliate(s) Manufacture such Materials itself, or (ii) the purchase price paid by Array for such Materials to the extent that Array elects to have such Materials Manufactured by a Subcontractor. The clinical supply agreement shall contain forecasting and ordering procedures (including lead times), product specifications, delivery terms and other customary terms, which terms shall in all cases be consistent with Array's contractual arrangements with its Subcontractors;\n\n(b) Array may place orders for Materials with its Subcontractors on Ono's behalf, or, subject to Ono and the Subcontractors entering into an agreement or other arrangement therefor, Array shall arrange with such Subcontractors for Ono to place such orders, for shipment to Ono and for Ono to pay for such Materials directly to the particular supplier. Array shall not require Ono to place orders directly with a Subcontractor if such Subcontractor is unwilling to fulfill such orders on terms as favorable to Ono as the terms such Subcontractors have extended to Array.\n\n(c)  Array shall use Diligent Efforts to secure for Ono the inspection rights from Array's Subcontractors for Materials. In the event Array is unable to secure such inspection rights from any of its Subcontractors, Array agrees to secure such rights for itself and, if requested by Ono, Array\n\n49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nshall exercise such rights, at Ono's expense, on behalf of Ono and fully report the results thereof to Ono.\n\n9.4 Commercial Supply.\n\n(a)  Ono shall have the right (but not the obligation) to Manufacture and/or package, or engage a Subcontractor to Manufacture, Ono's requirements of particular Materials (e.g., Ono's requirements of Drug Substance or Ono's requirements of Drug Product of a particular Product) related to any Product for the Ono Territory. Promptly following Ono's request, Array shall transfer, or cause to be transferred, to Ono or such Subcontractor all Array's Know-How that is necessary, useful or actually used for such Manufacture, packaging and/ or testing and release of Materials (and the cost of such transfer of Array Know-How shall be borne by Ono), and shall make personnel of Array reasonably available to assist Ono and/or its contractor in implementing the Array Know-How necessary to Manufacture and/or control and release such Materials. Upon completion of the technology transfer enabling Ono to Manufacture the Materials for the Ono Territory under the Marketing Approval, Array's supply obligations under Sections 9.2 and 9.3(b) with respect to such Materials shall terminate and Ono shall assume all supply-related liability with respect to such Materials which it Manufactures or sources from Subcontractor.\n\n(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Ono shall have the right to obtain from Array Ono's commercial requirements of Materials for the Ono Territory. Upon Ono's request, the Parties shall enter into a commercial supply agreement (a \"Supply Agreement\") and commercial quality agreement (a \"Quality Agreement\") on commercially reasonable terms documenting the arrangement pursuant to which:\n\n(i) Array shall supply Ono's reasonable requirements for Materials for the Ono Territory, which Supply Agreement shall contain forecasting and ordering procedures (including lead times), product specifications, delivery terms and other appropriate provisions mutually acceptable, and any customary terms, which terms shall in all cases be consistent with Array's contractual arrangements with its Subcontractors, and taking into account the regulatory requirements imposed on Ono as the holder of the Marketing Approval.\n\n(ii) Array has made arrangements with Novartis to transfer and validate at no cost to Ono all technology reasonably necessary for the manufacturing and analytical testing of the Materials by [ * ] so that commercial quantities of Materials and can be supplied to Ono and released for the Ono Territory;\n\n(iii) Materials supplied by Array to Ono for commercial sale of the Products shall be charged to Ono in an amount equal to (A) [ * ] of Array's manufacturing cost to the extent that Array or its\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nAffiliate(s) Manufacture such Materials itself, or (ii) [ * ] of the purchase price paid by Array for such Materials to the extent that Array elects to have such Materials Manufactured by a Subcontractor.\n\n9.5 Limitation; Manufacturing by Ono.

Array agrees to keep Ono generally informed as to the\n\n56\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\ncourse of such patent filing, prosecution, maintenance or other proceedings with respect to Array Patents. Array shall provide Ono with copies of each draft patent application with respect to Array Patents (in English, unless Japanese translation is available) to be filed as well as copies of each office action received from the relevant patent offices in each country of the Ono Territory, in each case with enough lead time where reasonably practicable, to enable Ono to review and comment on such application or action; provided that Array shall have no obligation to delay any action or response pending receipt of such comments or suggestions. Additionally, Array will provide Ono with copies of the patent applications and responses to office actions it ultimately files with the patent offices in the Ono Territory (in the original language, unless English translation is available). If Array determines not to file within any jurisdiction requested by Ono, not to continue the prosecution of, or not to continue to maintain or defend, any Array Patent in any country in the Ono Territory, or if Array otherwise determines to abandon any such Array Patent, Array shall promptly notify Ono of such determination sufficiently in advance to enable Ono to undertake or continue the prosecution, maintenance or defense of such Array Patent without a loss of rights, and Ono shall have the right to undertake or continue such prosecution, maintenance or defense at its sole cost and expense. Ono shall hold all information disclosed to it under this Section 11.2 as confidential.\n\n(b)  Prosecution of Joint Patents. Prior to preparation and filing of any Joint Patent, the Parties shall consult with one another and mutually agree upon a lead Party to file, prosecute and maintain such Joint Patent under the names of both Array and Ono. The Joint Patents shall be prepared and prosecuted by a mutually acceptable patent law firm and allocation of costs for preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance shall be agreed by the Parties prior to preparation and filing of such Joint Patent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may elect not to support the filing, prosecution and maintenance of all or part of any Joint Patent in any country in the world.\n\n(c) Patent Term Extensions. Array shall have the right, in consultation with Ono with respect to Array Patents, and Ono shall have the right, with respect to any Patents owned or Controlled by Ono, its Affiliates or Sublicensees related to the Product, to file all applications and take actions necessary to obtain patent term extensions, or similar additional or supplemental protection, with respect to the Product under statutes in any other country within the Ono Territory, which extensions shall be owned by the Party that owns or Controls the underlying Patent. If such Party declines to pursue such patent term extensions, then the other Party shall have the right on behalf of such Party to file all such applications and take all such actions necessary to obtain such patent term extensions (or similar additional or supplemental protection) with respect to the Product. In each case, the Parties shall fully cooperate to obtain such extensions and additional protection.\n\n57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\n11.3 Enforcement.\n\n(a)  Enforcement Actions.\n\n(i) In the event that Array or Ono becomes aware of actual or threatened infringement or misappropriation of any Array Patent or Array Know-How in any country within the Ono Territory by the Manufacture or sale or use of an unauthorized version of a Product (\"Infringing Product\"), then such Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing and the Parties shall consult with each other with respect to the strategy in response to such Infringing Product. Array shall have the first right, but not the obligation, to initiate proceedings or take other appropriate action in Ono Territory, at its own expense, against any such Third Party. If Array does not initiate proceedings or take other appropriate action within ninety (90) days of receipt of a request by Ono to initiate an enforcement proceeding, or if a legal proceeding must be commenced prior to the end of such ninety(90) day period to avoid a loss of rights, then no later than five (5) days prior to such deadline, then Ono shall be entitled to initiate infringement proceedings or take other appropriate action against an Infringing Product at its own expense. The Party conducting such action (\"Enforcing Party\") shall have full control over its conduct, including settlement thereof; provided, however, that the Enforcing Party may not settle any such action, or make any admissions or assert any position in such action, in a manner that would materially adversely affect the rights or interests of the other Party, without the prior written consent of the other Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In any event, the Parties shall assist one another and cooperate in any such litigation at Enforcing Party's reasonable request.\n\n(ii) With respect to Infringing Products containing Binimetinib, Ono's rights under Section 11.3(a)(i) are subject to the rights previously granted to AstraZeneca AB (\"AZ\") pursuant to Sections 8.3.1 and 8.3.3 of that certain Collaboration and License Agreement between Array and AZ, effective as of December 18, 2003, as amended by that certain Amendment to Collaboration and License Agreement, between Array and AZ, effective as of June 1, 2009 (collectively, the \"AZ Agreement\"). For the avoidance of doubt, the rights granted to or retained by Array pursuant to Sections 8.3.1 and 8.3.3 of the AZ Agreement shall, to the extent relating to Infringing Products containing Binimetinib, be subject to this Agreement, including this Section 11.3. Any enforcement actions initiated by AZ with respect to an Infringing Product shall be deemed initiated by Array for purposes of Section 11.3(a)(i), and the costs and expenses incurred by Array in such enforcement action shall include any costs and expenses reimbursed or required to be reimbursed by Array to AZ in accordance with the AZ Agreement in such enforcement action. Additionally it is further understood that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the AZ Agreement, and the rights granted to AZ thereunder, shall in no event constitute a breach of Sections 8.2 and 15.1.\n\n(iii) With respect to the responsibility and allocation of costs for the enforcement of the Joint Patents (i) against Third Party products that infringe the Joint Patents outside the Ono Territory, or (ii)\n\n58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nagainst Third Party products in the Ono Territory that infringe the Joint Patents but that are not \"Infringing Products\", the Parties shall discuss and agree at the time when the Parties consult with respect to the strategy of such enforcement action in response to such Third Party infringement.\n\n(b) Recovery.\n\n(i)  Array and Ono shall recover their respective actual out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys' fees), or equitable proportions thereof, associated with any litigation against infringers undertaken pursuant to Section 11.3(a) (i) or (ii) above or settlement thereof from any resulting recovery made by either Party. Any excess amount of such a recovery shall be allocated as follows: (i) if Ono initiated such litigation, [ * ] of such excess amount shall be retained by Ono and [ * ] by Array, and (ii) if Array initiated such litigation, Array shall retain [ * ] of such excess amount and Ono shall obtain [ * ] of such excess amount, to the extent such excess amount represents damages relating to Manufacture or sale or use of an Infringing Product in the Ono Territory.\n\n(ii) With respect to enforcement actions against infringers relating to Joint Patents undertaken pursuant to 11.3(a)(iii) above, the Parties shall discuss and agree in good faith at the time when the Parties consult with respect to the strategy of such enforcement action in response to such Third Party infringement.\n\n(c)  Cooperation. The Parties shall keep one another informed of the status of their respective activities regarding any litigation or settlement thereof concerning the Array Patents or the Array Know-How within the Ono Territory, and shall assist one another and cooperate in any such litigation at the other's reasonable request (including joining as a party plaintiff to the extent necessary and requested by the other Party).\n\n11.4 Third Party Infringement Claims.\n\n(a) If the production, sale or use of any Product in the Ono Territory pursuant to this Agreement results in a claim, suit or proceeding alleging patent infringement against Array and/or Ono (or their respective Affiliates, licensees or Sublicensees) (collectively, \"Infringement Actions\"), the Party subject to such claim, suit or proceeding (\"Subject Party\") shall promptly notify the other Party hereto in writing and shall discuss with the other Party the strategy for defending such Infringement Actions but shall have the right to direct and control the defense thereof in its sole discretion and at its own expense, with counsel of its choice; provided, however, the other Party may participate in the defense and/or settlement thereof, at its own expense with counsel of its choice. In any event, the Subject Party agrees to keep the other Party hereto reasonably informed of all material developments in connection with any such Infringement Action. Ono agrees not to settle such Infringement Action, or make any admissions or assert any position in such Infringement Action, in a manner that would adversely affect the allegedly infringing Product\n\n59\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nor the Manufacture, use or sale of such Product in any country of the world, without the prior written consent of Array; and Array agrees not to settle such Infringement Action, or make any admissions or assert any position in such Infringement Action, in a manner that would adversely affect the allegedly infringing Product, or the Manufacture, use or sale of such Product, within the Ono Territory, without the prior written consent of Ono, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.\n\nARTICLE XII   TRADEMARKS\n\n12.1 Display.\n\n(a)  All packaging materials, labels and Marketing Materials for the Products shall display the Product Trademarks in katakana or in other applicable language and no other product-specific trademarks or branding.\n\n(i) Products Containing Binimetinib. Where possible, Ono shall utilize \"mektovi\" as the Product Trademark for Products containing Binimetinib. If the use of \"mektovi\" is not advisable for legal, regulatory or other material reasons outside the Parties' reasonable control, in one or more countries of the Ono Territory, Ono shall utilize \"balimek\" as such Product Trademark is such country or countries. If neither \"mektovi\" not \"balimek\" can be used (or if it is not advisable to use them) for legal, regulatory or other material reasons outside the Parties' reasonable control, in one or more countries of the Ono Territory, Ono may select an alternative Product Trademark reasonably acceptable to Array for use in such country or countries, with any disputes being referred to the JCC for resolution, it being understood that in resolving any such dispute the JCC shall give preference to the creation of a single brand for Products containing Binimetinib in countries where neither \"balimek\" or \"mektovi\" can be used.\n\n(ii) Products Containing Encorafenib. Where possible, Ono shall utilize \"braftovi\" as the Product Trademark for Products containing Encorafenib. If the use of \"braftovi\" is not advisable for legal, regulatory or other material reasons outside the Parties' reasonable control, in one or more countries of the Ono Territory, Ono may select an alternative Product Trademark reasonably acceptable to Array for use in such country or countries, with any disputes being referred to the JCC for resolution, it being understood that in resolving any such dispute the JCC shall give preference to the creation of a single brand for Products containing Encorafenib in countries where \"braftovi\" cannot be used.\n\n(b) Each Product shall be sold in the Ono Territory under the trade name Ono or other trade name chosen by Ono and the logo of Ono; provided, however that to the extent permissible under applicable Law within the Ono Territory, such packaging materials, labels and Marketing Materials shall also display the trade name of Array in reasonable size and prominence,\n\n60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nas reasonably approved by Array. The trademarks of Ono, trade dress, style of packaging and the like with respect to the Product in the Ono Territory may be determined by Ono in a manner that is consistent with Ono's standard trade dress and style, but shall be subject to the approval by the JCC to ensure the same are consistent with Array's global trademark guidelines.\n\n12.2 Assignment. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, following registration of the Product Trademark(s) by Array in the Ono Territory pursuant to Section 12.3 below, Array shall assign, and shall cause its Affiliates to assign, to Ono all rights to the Product Trademark(s) so registered in the Ono Territory at Ono's cost and expense, in each case solely for the purpose of Commercializing the Products in the Ono Territory in accordance with this Agreement. Ono shall be responsible for maintenance of such Product Trademark(s) at its cost and expense in the Ono Territory.\n\n12.3 Registration of Trademarks and Trade Dress.\n\n(a)  Products Containing Binimetinib. If the Product Trademark for Products containing Binimetinib is balimek or mektovi, Array (or its designee) shall use Diligent Efforts to file and register at Array's expense and in its own name (to the extent permitted by applicable Law), appropriate registrations for such Product Trademarks in the Ono Territory. If, however, neither balimek nor mektovi is available or desirable in a given country or countries, Ono agrees to file and register, at Ono's expense and name, appropriate registrations for an alternative Product Trademark (selected in accordance with Section 12.1(a)(i)) in such country or countries of the Ono Territory. As between the Parties, Ono shall have the sole right to file at its expense and in its own name, appropriate registrations for the trade dress utilized with the Product in the Ono Territory.\n\n(b) Products Containing Encorafenib. If the Product Trademark for Products containing Encorafenib is braftovi, Array (or its designee) shall use Diligent Efforts to file and register at Array's expense and in its own name (to the extent permitted by applicable Law), appropriate registrations for such Product Trademarks in the Ono Territory. If, however, braftovi is not available or desirable in a given country or countries, Ono agrees to file and register, at Ono's expense and name, appropriate registrations for an alternative Product Trademark (selected in accordance with Section 12.1(a)(ii)) in such country or countries of the Ono Territory. As between the Parties, Ono shall have the sole right to file at its expense and in its own name, appropriate registrations for the trade dress utilized with the Product in the Ono Territory.\n\n12.4 Approval of Packaging and Promotional Materials. The Parties agree that the quality of the Products packaging shall be consistent with the highest standards of quality in the pharmaceuticals industry.\n\n(a)  Mektovi/Balimek/Array. Without limiting Section 5.1(c) above, to the extent necessary to preserve Array's legal rights in the balimek or mektovi Product Trademarks,\n\n61\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nOno shall submit representative Marketing Materials, packaging and Product displaying the balimek or mektovi Product Trademarks and/or Array's trade name to Array for Array's review and approval (such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) prior to the first use of such Marketing Materials, packaging or Product and prior to any subsequent change or addition to such Marketing Materials, packaging or Product; provided that if Array has not responded within ten (10) Business Days after the submission of such Marketing Materials, packaging or Product, Array's approval will be deemed to have been received.\n\n(b) Braftovi/Array. Without limiting Section 5.1(c) above, to the extent necessary to preserve Array's legal rights in the braftovi Product Trademark, Ono shall submit representative Marketing Materials, packaging and Product displaying the braftovi Product Trademark and/or Array's trade name to Array for Array's review and approval (such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) prior to the first use of such Marketing Materials, packaging or Product and prior to any subsequent change or addition to such Marketing Materials, packaging or Product; provided that if Array has not responded within ten (10) Business Days after the submission of such Marketing Materials, packaging or Product, Array's approval will be deemed to have been received.\n\n(c)  Other. With respect to all Product Trademarks other than balimek, mektovi or braftovi, Ono shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates and Sublicensees to, comply with trademark style and usage standards approved by Array from time to time in connection with use of the Product Trademark(s). Ono shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, at its own expense, submit representative Marketing Materials, packaging and Product displaying such Product Trademarks to Array for approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event that Array reasonably objects to a proposed usage of the Product Trademark(s), it shall give written notice of such objection to Ono within sixty (60) days of receipt of such sample, specifying the way in which such usage of its Product Trademark(s) fails to meet the style, usage or quality standards for the Product or Product Trademark set forth in the first two sentences of this Section 12.4(c). If Ono or its Affiliate wishes to use such representative Marketing Materials, it must remedy the failure and submit further samples to Array's for approval.\n\n12.5 Enforcement.\n\n(a)  If either Party becomes aware of any actual or threatened infringement of any Product Trademark in the Ono Territory, such Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing. Ono shall, at its own expense, initiate infringement proceedings or take other appropriate actions against an infringement of any Product Trademark in the Ono Territory and/or to defend any actions or proceedings involving the Product Trademarks in the Ono Territory, as the case may be. Ono shall have full control over the conduct of such action, including settlement thereof;\n\n62\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nprovided, however, Ono may not settle any such action, or make any admissions or assert any position in such action, in a manner that would materially adversely affect the Product Trademarks in the Ono Territory nor the rights or interests of Array, without the prior written consent of Array, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In any event, the Ono shall keep Array informed of the status of its activities regarding any litigation in the Ono Territory involving a Product Trademark or settlement thereof and Array shall assist Ono and cooperate in any such litigation at Ono's reasonable request and expense.\n\n(b) Ono and Array shall recover their respective actual out-of-pocket expenses, or proportionate percentages thereof, associated with any litigation against infringers undertaken pursuant to this Section 12.5 or settlement thereof from any resulting recovery made by either Party. Any excess amount of such a recovery shall be [ * ] between Ono and Array, to the extent such recovery represents damages pertaining to the infringement of a Product Trademark in the Ono Territory.\n\n12.6 Domain Names. Array shall own rights to, and shall be responsible, at its own expense, for registering and maintaining, the Internet domain names listed on Exhibit 12.6 (each of the foregoing, a \"Domain Name\") and agrees to grant, and hereby grants to Ono a royalty-free, fully paid-up exclusive license to use those particular Domain Names which Ono elects to use (and actually uses) in connection with Ono's commercialization of the Product in the Ono Territory in accordance with this Agreement. In the event Ono would like to use an available Internet domain name including the balimek, mektovi or braftovi, or Product Trademarks not previously registered to Array, Array grants Ono its consent to register and maintain such Internet domain names in Ono's name and at Ono's expense, provided that upon termination (but not expiration) of this Agreement, Ono shall transfer full and exclusive ownership and control of such Internet domain names to Array, or if Array so requests, promptly withdraw registration of such Internet domain name(s), in each case at Ono's sole cost and expense. Each Party shall own rights to any Internet domain names incorporating the Product Trademark(s) owned by such Party under Section 12.1 or any variation or part of such Product Trademark(s) as its URL address or any part of such address, and agrees to grant, and hereby grants to the other Party a royalty-free, fully paid-up exclusive license to use those particular Internet domain names which the grantee Party elects to use (and actually uses) in connection with the grantee Party's commercialization of the applicable Product in the grantee Party's Territory in accordance with this Agreement. The use rights granted to the Internet domain names under this Section 12.6 are limited to the grantee Party's Territory, and neither Party shall actively make or authorize any use, direct or otherwise, of its Internet domain names outside its respective territory. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the Internet domain names and the goodwill pertaining to such Internet domain names shall belong exclusively to the Party owning such Internet domain name, who shall be registered as \"Registrant\" or \"Owner\" and as \"Administrative Contact\" of the relevant domain name. The Parties agree that any use of a Product Trademark in any content describing or referring to a Product: (i) on any internet page or web site operated by Array in\n\n63\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nthe Array Territory shall be in the sole control of Array, and (ii) on any internet page or web site operated by Ono in the Ono Territory, subject to the terms of this Agreement, shall be in the sole control of Ono, and therefore Ono and Array, respectively, shall be responsible for any damage caused to the Product Trademarks as a result of their use of the Product Trademarks on any internet page or web site in their respective territories.\n\nARTICLE XIII\n\nTERM AND TERMINATION\n\n13.1 Term. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and, unless terminated earlier pursuant to this Article 13, shall continue in full force and effect, on a Product-by-Product and country-by-country basis until the Secondary Royalty Term with respect to such Product expires, at which time this Agreement shall expire in its entirety with respect to such Product in such country. Upon expiration of this Agreement, the licenses granted to Ono under Section 2.1 shall become non-exclusive, fully paid- up, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty free licenses, with sublicensing rights, to Develop, Manufacture, and/or Commercialize the Products in the Ono Territory. From and after the expiration of this Agreement, Ono shall have the exclusive, fully paid up, royalty- free right to use (i) Product Trademarks assigned to Ono under Section 12.2, and (ii) those Domain Names licensed to Ono under Section 12.6, in each case solely for purposes of, and to the extent necessary, for Ono to continue to Commercialize the Products in the Field in the Ono Territory.\n\n13.2 Termination by Ono without Cause. Commencing on the later of (i) [ * ] of the First Commercial Sale of the Binimetinib Product in the Ono Territory, or (ii) [ * ] of the First Commercial Sale of the Encorafenib Product in the Ono Territory, Ono shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, for any reasons by giving [ * ] advance written notice to Array which shall be accompanied by the rationale for such termination.\n\n13.3 Termination for Material Breach. Either Party may terminate this Agreement in its entirety in the event the other Party shall have materially breached or defaulted in the performance of any of its material obligations hereunder, and such default shall have continued for ninety (90) days (or with respect to any breach of any payment obligations, for sixty (60) days) after written notice thereof was provided to the breaching Party by the non\u2011breaching Party. Any such termination shall become effective at the end of such ninety (90) day period (or sixty (60) day period with respect to any failure to pay) unless the breaching Party has cured any such breach or default prior to the expiration of the applicable cure period. Exercising the right to terminate this Agreement by a Party pursuant to this Section 13.3 shall not preclude a claim or a compensation for damages on the other Party.\n\n13.4 Termination for Bankruptcy. Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other Party: (a) if such other Party is declared insolvent or bankrupt by a\n\n64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\ncourt of competent jurisdiction; (b) if a voluntary or involuntary petition in bankruptcy is filed in any court of competent jurisdiction against such other Party and such petition is not dismissed within ninety (90) days after filing; (c) if such other Party shall make or execute an assignment of substantially all of its assets for the benefit of creditors; or (d) substantially all of the assets of such other Party are seized or attached and not released within ninety (90) days thereafter.\n\n13.5 Termination for Safety Reasons and Efficacy Reason.\n\n(a)  Ono shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, on a Product-by-Product basis, for Safety Reasons upon thirty (30) days written notice to Array or within a shorter period if required under applicable Law, but only after consulting with Array and obtaining Array's agreement with Ono's assessment with respect to such Safety Reasons (or as provided for below, the agreement of the Experts). Ono shall have the right to terminate this Agreement for Efficacy Reasons upon one hundred and eighty (180) days written notice to Array.\n\n(b) If Array disagrees with Ono's assessment with respect to Safety Reasons, such matter shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 17.2, which shall apply mutatis mutandis, which Experts shall determine whether the Safety Reasons are justified and are unlikely to be reversed, within a reasonable period of time with a commercially reasonable level of investment. The opinion of the majority of the Experts shall be finally binding on the Parties.\n\n(c)  \"Safety Reasons\" shall mean that, based upon all relevant scientific data, there are safety and public health issues relating to the Product such that the medical benefit/risk ratio of such Product is sufficiently unfavorable as to materially compromise the welfare of patients so that the use in patients is no longer justifiable and that such issues are unlikely to be reversed within a reasonable period of time with a commercially reasonable level of investment.\n\n(d) \"Efficacy Reasons\" shall mean that either (i) there is no efficacy or lower efficacy of the Products in comparison with control arm in COLUMBUS Clinical Study as well as BEACON Clinical Study (neither triplet therapy nor doublet therapy demonstrates statistically significant efficacy in comparison with control arm), or (ii) as of the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date, neither BRAF-mutant Melanoma and Marketing Approval nor BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer have received Marketing Approval from MHLW.\n\nARTICLE XIV   EFFECT OF TERMINATION\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\n14.1 Accrued Obligations. The expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason shall not release either Party from any liability which, at the time of such expiration or termination, has already accrued to the other Party or which is attributable to a period prior to such expiration or termination, nor will any termination of this Agreement preclude either Party from pursuing all rights and remedies it may have under this Agreement, or at law or in equity, with respect to breach of this Agreement.\n\n14.2 Rights on Termination of Agreement. In case of termination of this Agreement by either Party, this Section 14.2 shall apply:\n\n(a)  Wind-down.\n\n(i) Development. In the event Ono is the sponsor of or conducting any on-going Clinical Studies of the Product following the date a notice of termination has been issued by Array or Ono, to the extent requested by Array, Ono agrees to: (A) continue to sponsor or conduct any such Clinical Studies in normal course if such Clinical Studies can be completed (i) within [ * ] following the effective date of termination in the case of a termination by Ono pursuant to Section 13.2, or (ii) within [ * ] following the effective date of termination in the case of any other termination of this Agreement by either Party, or (B) promptly transition to Array or its designee such sponsorship or Clinical Studies (or portions thereof) provided that in such case, Array shall take over such studies (i) within [ * ] following the effective date of termination in the case of a termination by Ono pursuant to Section 13.2, or (ii) within [ * ] following the effective date of termination in the case of any other termination of this Agreement by either Party. In addition, in the event Ono is conducting any on-going pre-clinical studies and/or formulation studies (e.g., stability studies) of the Product, Ono agrees to promptly transition to Array or its designee such pre-clinical studies and/or formulation studies to the extent such transfer is reasonably possible. In the case of a termination by Array pursuant to Section 8.2, 13.3 or 13.4 or by Ono pursuant to Section 13.2, Ono shall be responsible for (1) costs of carrying out the transfers described in this Section 14.2(a)(i), and (2) all costs of on-going Clinical Studies through the termination of the wind-down period (including for clarity, the costs incurred by Array in carrying out any transferred Clinical Studies through the termination of the wind-down period). In all other cases Array shall be responsible for such costs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Ono terminates this Agreement with respect to a Product pursuant to Section 13.5(a), Ono shall not be obligated to continue to sponsor or conduct any Clinical Studies with respect to such Product under Section 14.2(a)(i)(A) above.\n\n(ii) Commercialization. To avoid disruption in the availability of Product to patients, if this Agreement is terminated after the First Commercial Sale of the Product in the Ono Territory other than pursuant to Section 13.5, then to the extent requested by Array, Ono, its Affiliates and its Sublicensees shall continue to distribute (but shall not be obligated to market or promote) the Product, in accordance\n\n66\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nwith the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in each country of the Ono Territory for which Marketing Approval therefor has been obtained, taking into account applicable issues, if any, for patient safety or the requirements of a Regulatory Authority within the Ono Territory, until the date on which Array notifies Ono in writing that Array has secured an alternative distributor or licensee for the Product in such country, but in no event more for than (A) [ * ] after the date of such notice of termination of this Agreement by Ono pursuant to Section 13.2 or by Array pursuant to Section 13.4 or (B) [ * ] after the date of such notice of termination of this Agreement by Array pursuant to Sections 8.2 or 13.3 or by Ono pursuant to Section 13.3 or 13.4 (\"Wind- down Period\"); provided that Ono, its Affiliates and its Sublicensees shall cease such activities, or any portion thereof, in a given country upon sixty (60) days' notice by Array requesting that such activities (or portion thereof) be ceased.

If the Parties do not reach a mutually acceptable resolution as to an Expert Dispute following referral to Executive Officers described in Section 17.1, then upon written notice by either Party (an \"Expert Resolution Notice\"), the Expert Dispute shall be resolved by a final, binding determination by independent experts in the manner described in this Section 17.2.\n\n77\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\n(c)  Selection of Experts. Each Party shall select an independent Third Party expert who is neutral, disinterested and impartial, is not affiliated with either Party, has expertise and experience relevant to the specific subject matter of the particular Expert Dispute, and does not have a conflict of interest, and two experts so elected shall elect the third expert with qualification as set forth above (the three experts so selected, the \"Experts\"). Once the Experts have been selected, each Party shall, in accordance with mutually agreed timelines and procedures, but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days from the selection of the Experts, provide the Experts and the other Party with a written report setting forth its position with respect to the substance of the Expert Dispute and may submit a revised or updated report and position to the Experts as mutually agreed or as determined by the Experts. If so requested by the Experts, each Party shall make oral submissions to the Experts based on such Party's written report delivered pursuant to this Section 17.2(c), and each Party shall have the right to be present during any such oral submissions.\n\n(d) Determination by the Experts. The Experts shall, no later than ten (10) Business Days after the last submission of the written reports and, if any, oral submissions, select one of the Parties' positions as their final decision, and shall not have the authority to modify either Party's position or render any substantive decision other than to so select the position of either Ono or Array as set forth in their respective written report (as initially submitted, or as revised in accordance with Section 17.2(c), as applicable). The Parties agree that the decision of the Experts shall be the sole, exclusive and binding remedy between them regarding any Expert Dispute presented to the Experts, provided that the Experts' decision with respect to disputes referred to it pursuant to Section 3.5 shall become the decision of the JDRC on the matter for all purposes of this Agreement. The proceedings and the decision of the Experts shall not be made public without the joint consent of the Parties and each Party shall maintain the confidentiality of such proceedings and decision unless each Party otherwise agrees in writing; provided that either Party may make such disclosures as are permitted for Confidential Information of the other Party under Article 10 above.\n\n(e)  Timetable for Completion in Thirty (30) business days. The Parties shall use, and shall direct the Experts to use, diligent efforts to resolve any Expert Dispute within thirty (30) Business Days after the selection of the Experts, or if resolution within thirty (30) Business Days is not reasonably achievable, as determined by the Experts, then as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable, provided that the Experts shall resolve the Expert Dispute no later than ninety (90) Business Days after the selection of the Experts.\n\n17.3 Arbitration. Except with respect to (i) those matters subject to determination by the Experts as provided in Section 17.2, or (ii) any dispute between the Parties concerning the inventorship of intellectual property rights for which either Party may pursue such remedies as it may deem necessary\n\n78\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nor appropriate, any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (each, a \"Dispute\") shall be exclusively resolved by final and binding arbitration as follows:\n\n(a)  Arbitration under the ICC Rules of Arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted by three (3) arbitrators according to the ICC Rules of Arbitration (\"Rules\"), and the panel of three arbitrators so selected is referred to herein as the \"Arbitration Tribunal.\" The seat of the arbitration shall be in Osaka, Japan, if it is demanded by Array, and in New York, NY, USA, if it is demanded by Ono, with hearings to held in the same location. The Emergency Arbitrator Provisions shall not apply.\n\n(b) Conduct of the proceedings. The language of arbitration shall be English. If so requested by the Arbitration Tribunal, any documents originally in a language other than English shall be submitted with an English translation. The Arbitration Tribunal shall have the authority to order document production taking guidance from the applicable rules under the laws of the seat of the arbitration. If the tribunal orders production of documents, the tribunal shall take guidance from the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration as current on the dated the commencement of the arbitration. The Parties wish to avoid a costly and time-consuming discovery exercise. The Arbitration Tribunal shall have the power to appoint one or more experts after having consulted with the Parties. For the avoidance of doubt, the governing law set forth in Section 18.3 shall not apply to determine any procedural issues. In particular, but without in any way restricting the generality of the foregoing, the Parties agree that the procedural rules of the governing law set forth in Section 18.3 shall not apply with respect to document production or other evidentiary issues, except that all privileges restricting disclosure established under such governing law shall apply and may be invoked by both Parties\n\n(c)  Time limit for rendering the award. The Parties and the Arbitration Tribunal shall endeavor to complete any arbitration within twelve (12) months following the full constitution of the Arbitration Tribunal. However, this period is not a deadline and failure to render an award within them shall not be a ground for annulment of an award.\n\n(d) Decision of the Arbitration Tribunal. Every award shall be binding on the Parties. By submitting the dispute to arbitration under the Rules, the Parties undertake to carry out any award without delay and shall be deemed to have waived their right to any form of recourse insofar as such waiver can validly be made. The Parties agree that they can seek recognition and enforcement of any order and/or award made by the Arbitration Tribunal before any competent court. The Arbitration Tribunal shall have no authority to award punitive damages or other damages exceeding the damages actually suffered by the prevailing Party, and may not, in any event, make any ruling, finding or award that does not conform to the provisions of this Agreement. The fees and expenses of the Arbitration Tribunal (the translation fee described Section 17.3 (b) shall be\n\n79\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nincluded) shall be shared equally by the Parties, and each Party shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding, in each case unless the Arbitration Tribunal in the award assesses such fees and/or expenses against one of the Parties or allocates such fees and expenses other than equally between the Parties.\n\n(e)  Confidentiality. The existence and content of the Arbitration proceedings and any rulings or award shall be deemed Confidential Information of both Parties hereunder and kept confidential by the Parties and members of the Arbitration Tribunal except (i) where such disclosure is permitted under Article 10 of this Agreement, (ii) to the extent that disclosure may be required of a Party to fulfil a legal duty, protect or pursue a legal right, or enforce or challenge an award in bona fide legal proceedings before a state court or other judicial authority, (iii) with the consent of all Parties made in writing subsequently to this Agreement, (iii) where needed for the preparation or presentation of a claim or defense in this arbitration, (iv) where such information is already in the public domain other than as a result of a breach of this clause, or (v) by order of the Arbitration Tribunal upon application of a Party.\n\n(f)  Non-Disclosure of Communications with Internal Counsel. Notwithstanding any rights to the contrary under applicable procedural or substantive rules of Law, any communications exchanged between members of each Party's respective legal department and directors, employees or agents in connection with any disputes, investigations, administrative or other proceedings, shall not be requested, produced or otherwise used, to the extent such communications would have been covered by legal privilege and not disclosable, had these communications been exchanged between such Party and its external attorneys.\n\n(g) Interim Relief. The Arbitration Tribunal shall have the power to grant any remedy or relief that it deems appropriate, whether provisional or final, including but not limited to conservatory relief and injunctive relief, and any such measures ordered by the Arbitration Tribunal shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the governing law selected by the Parties pursuant to Section 18.3, be deemed to be a final award on the subject matter of the measures and shall be enforceable as such. Each Party retains the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional and/or conservatory relief, including injunctions or temporary restraining orders before or after the constitution of the Arbitration Tribunal, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with the Agreement to arbitrate or a waiver of the right to arbitrate.\n\nARTICLE XVIII\n\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n18.1 Force Majeure. If the performance of any part of this Agreement (except for any payment obligation under this Agreement) by either Party is prevented, restricted, interfered with or delayed by\n\n80\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nreason of any cause beyond the reasonable control of such Party (including, fire, flood, earthquake, tsunami, embargo, power shortage or failure, acts of war, insurrection, riot, terrorism, strike, lockout or other labor disturbance, acts of God or any acts, omissions or delays in acting of the other Party), the Party so affected shall, upon giving written notice to the other Party, be excused from such performance to the extent of such prevention, restriction, interference or delay; provided that the affected Party shall use its reasonable efforts to avoid or remove such causes of non-performance and shall continue performance with the utmost dispatch whenever such causes are removed.\n\n18.2 Hardship.

The request shall indicate the grounds on which it is based. The Parties shall then consult one another with a view to revising the contract an equitable basis, in order to ensure that neither Party suffers excessive prejudice. The request for revision does not of itself suspend performance of the contract. If the Parties fail to agree on the revision of the contract within time limit of ninety (90) business days of the request, the contract remains in force in accordance with its original terms.\n\n18.3 Governing Law. This Agreement and all questions regarding its validity or interpretation, or the breach or performance of this Agreement, shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, United States, without reference to conflict of law principles. The Parties hereby agree that the provisions of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement and are strictly excluded.\n\n18.4 Waiver of Breach. The failure of either Party at any time or times to require performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect its rights at a later time to enforce the same. No waiver by either Party of any condition or term in any one or more instances shall be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such condition or term or of another condition or term.\n\n18.5 Modification. No amendment or modification of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing signed by both Parties hereto. No provision of this Agreement shall be varied, contradicted or explained by any oral agreement, course of dealing or performance or any other matter not set forth in an agreement in writing and signed by both Parties hereto.\n\n18.6 Severability. In the event any provision of this Agreement should be held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith a valid, legal and enforceable substitute provision that most nearly reflects the original intent of the Parties and all other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in such jurisdiction. Such invalidity, illegality\n\n81\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nor unenforceability shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.\n\n18.7 Entire Agreement; Amendments.

In the event that the challenging authority is not convinced, the Parties shall request that the tax authorities in the US and in Roche's Jurisdiction initiate government-to-government procedures pursuant to the applicable bi- lateral convention for the avoidance of double taxation or similar treaty or convention (if any) between the US and Roche's Jurisdiction (\"Competent Authority Procedures\").\n\n\n\n(b) In the event that the US tax authorities determine that such remunerations for products and services or other payments are not appropriate and levy an assessment on FMI, and such assessment results in a refund (or similar payment or credit) by or from the tax authorities in Roche's Jurisdiction to Roche or its relevant Affiliate, then Roche shall pay (or shall ensure that Roche shall pay) the amount of such refund to FMI. In the event that the tax authorities in Roche's Jurisdiction determine that such remunerations for products and services or other payments are not appropriate and levy an assessment on Roche, and such assessment results in a refund (or similar payment or credit) by or from the US tax authorities to FMI then FMI shall pay (or shall ensure that FMI shall pay) the amount of such refund to Roche. Each Party shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain such refund (or similar payment or credit).\n\n  (c) In the event of such an assessment by either tax authority (an \"Assessment\"), the Parties agree to making adjustments to the relevant remunerations for products and services or other payments to levels agreed to by the tax authorities in both the US and Roche's Jurisdiction as the result of Competent Authority Procedures.\n\n  11. Auditing\n\n11.1 Right to Audit\n\nEach Party shall keep, and shall require its Affiliates and Sublicensees to keep, full, true and accurate books of account containing all particulars that may be necessary for the purpose of calculating all payments payable under this Agreement, including, for Roche, the right to audit materials necessary to ensure compliance with the most favored customer provisions of Article 5. Such books of accounts shall be kept at their principal place of business. At the expense of the auditing Party, the auditing Party shall have the right to engage an internationally recognized, independent public accountant reasonably accept able to the other Party to perform, on behalf of such Party an audit of such books and records of the audited Party and its Affiliates, its licensees and Sublicensees, that are deemed necessary for the period or periods requested by the auditing Party and the correctness of any financial report or payments made under this Agreement, including with respect to benefits and terms complying with the most favored   - 40 -\n\n\n\n\n\ncustomer provisions of Article 5. For avoidance of doubt, all audits under this Section shall be conducted solely by an independent public accountant as described in the foregoing sentence.\n\nUpon timely request and at least [\u2026***\u2026] prior written notice from the auditing Party, such audit shall be conducted in the countries specifically requested by the auditing Party, during regular business hours in such a manner as to not unnecessarily interfere with the audited Party's normal business activities, and shall be limited to results in the [\u2026***\u2026] prior to audit notification.\n\nSuch audit shall not be performed more frequently than [\u2026***\u2026] nor more frequently than [\u2026***\u2026] with respect to records covering, or impacting in accordance with Article 5, any specific period of time.\n\nAll information, data documents and abstracts herein referred to shall be used only for the purpose of verifying payment obligations, shall be treated as the audited Party's Confidential Information subject to the obligations of this Agreement and need neither be retained more than [\u2026 ***\u2026] after completion of an audit hereof, if an audit has been requested; nor more than [\u2026***\u2026] from the end of the [\u2026***\u2026] to which each shall pertain; nor more than [\u2026***\u2026] after the date of termination of this Agreement.\n\n  11.2 Audit Reports\n\nThe auditors shall only state factual findings in the audit reports and shall not interpret the agreement. The auditors shall share all draft audit reports with the auditing Party before the draft report is shared with the audited Party and before the final document is issued. The final audit report shall be shared with the auditing Party at the same time it is shared with the audited Party.\n\n  11.3 Over or Underpayment\n\nIf the audit reveals an overpayment by Roche, FMI shall reimburse Roche for the amount of the overpayment within [\u2026***\u2026]. If the audit reveals an underpayment by Roche, Roche shall make up such underpayment with the next payment or, if no further payments are owed by Roche, Roche shall reimburse FMI for the amount of the underpayment within [\u2026***\u2026]. The audited Party shall pay for the audit costs if the underpayment of the audited Party exceeds [\u2026***\u2026] of the aggregate amount of royalty payments owed with regard to the period subject of the audit. Section 9.2 shall apply to this Section 11.3.\n\n  11.4 Duration of Audit Rights\n\nThe failure of a Party to request verification of any calculation within the period during which corresponding records must be maintained under this Article 11 will be deemed to be acceptance of the payments and reports.\n\n  12. Intellectual Property\n\n12.1 Ownership of Inventions, data and results\n\n  12.1.1 In General\n\nExcept as specifically set forth herein, FMI shall own all FMI Inventions, Roche shall own all Roche Inventions, and FMI and Roche shall jointly own all Joint Inventions.

For the avoidance of doubt, each Party is responsible for fulfilling the obligations towards their employees under the German Statute of Employee's Inventions.\n\n  12.3 Prosecution and Maintenance of Patent Rights Claiming FMI Inventions\n\nFMI shall, at its own expense and discretion, (i) control and Handle all FMI Foreground Patent Rights, (ii) consult with Roche as to the Handling of such FMI Foreground Patent Rights, and (iii) furnish to Roche copies of all material documents relevant to any such Handling. FMI shall furnish such documents and consult with Roche in sufficient time before any action by FMI is due to allow Roche to provide comments thereon, which comments FMI must consider. At FMI's\n\n- 43 -\n\n\n\n\n\nexpense and reasonable request, Roche shall cooperate, in all reasonable ways with the Handling of all FMI Foreground Patent Rights. If FMI elects not to Handle any FMI Foreground Patent Rights under this Section 12.3, then FMI shall provide at least [\u2026***\u2026] prior written notice to Roche. Thereafter, Roche shall have the right, but not the obligation to Handle any such notified FMI Foreground Patent Rights, at its sole expense and its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and for clarity, FMI shall have no obligations to Roche under this Section 12.3 in regard to FMI Foreground Patent Rights relating to the Genomic Analysis Platform or the Molecular Information Database (including, without limitation, methods, procedures, and algorithms related to or embodied in each) that do not incorporate or rely on the continued use of Roche Confidential Information.\n\n  12.4 Prosecution and Maintenance of Roche Foreground Patent Rights and Joint Patent Rights\n\nRoche shall, at its own expense and discretion, control and Handle (including abandon) all Roche Foreground Patent Rights and Joint Patent Rights.

Thereafter, FMI shall have the right, but not the obligation to Handle any such notified Patent Rights, at its sole expense and its sole discretion.\n\n  12.5 Joint Patent Team\n\nWhere the Parties need to consult with each other on the Handling of Patent Rights, the Parties shall establish a joint patent team (\"JPT\") and shall adopt procedures for interacting on patent matters. The JPT shall be subject to the oversight of the JMC. The JPT shall also serve as a forum for promptly notifying the other Party when an Invention is made by a Party.\n\n  12.6 CREATE Act\n\nIt is the intention of the Parties that this Agreement is a \"joint research agreement\" as that phrase is defined in Public Law 108-53 (\"Create Act\") and applied in 35 USC \u00a7103(c)(3). If either Party intends to overcome a rejection of a claimed invention within the FMI Foreground Patent Rights or Roche Foreground Patent Rights pursuant to the provisions of the Create Act, then the Parties, through the JPT, shall work together in good faith to agree in writing how any rejection should be overcome.\n\n  12.7 Infringement\n\nEach Party shall promptly provide written notice to the other Party during the Agreement Term of any (i) known infringement or suspected infringement by a Third Party of any FMI Background Patent Rights, FMI Foreground Patent Rights, Roche Background Patent Rights, Roche Foreground Patent Rights or Joint Patent Rights, or (ii) known or suspected unauthorized use or misappropriation by a Third Party of any FMI Background Know-How, FMI Know-How, Roche Background Know-How, Roche Know-How or Joint Know-How, and shall provide the other Party with all evidence in its possession supporting such infringement or unauthorized use or misappropriation.\n\nWithin [\u2026***\u2026] after a Party provides or receives such written notice (\"Decision Period\"), the Party Handling enforcement of such Patent Right as set forth in this Section 2.7, in its sole discretion, shall decide whether or not to initiate such suit or action in the Territory and shall notify the other Party in writing of its decision in writing (\"Suit Notice\").   ***Confidential Treatment Requested***\n\n- 44 -\n\n\n\n\n\nFor any FMI Background Patent Right or sole FMI Patent Right, FMI in its sole discretion shall decide whether or not to initiate such suit or action in the Territory. FMI shall have full discretion as to how it wishes to handle such suit and may reach Settlement under any terms and conditions it desires and retain all damages, settlement fees or other consideration received in connection therewith. Only if a Settlement could adversely affect Roche shall the written consent of Roche be required, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The term \"adversely affect\" in the previous sentence shall include, among other things, [\u2026***\u2026].\n\nFor any sole Roche Background Patent Right or Roche Patent Right, Roche, in its sole discretion, shall decide whether or not to initiate such suit or action in the Territory. Roche shall have full discretion as to how it wishes to handle such suit and may reach Settlement under any terms and conditions it desires and retain all damages, settlement fees or other consideration received in connection therewith. Only if a Settlement could adversely affect FMI shall the written consent of FMI be required, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.\n\nIf for a Joint Patent Right, Roche decides to bring a suit or take action, once Roche provides Suit Notice, Roche may immediately commence such suit or take such action. In the event that Roche (i) does not in writing advise FMI within the Decision Period that Roche will commence suit or take action, or (ii) fails to commence suit or take action within a reasonable time after providing Suit Notice, FMI shall thereafter have the right to commence suit or take action in the Territory and shall provide written notice Roche of any such suit commenced or action taken by FMI.\n\nUpon written request, the Party bringing suit or taking action (\"Initiating Party\") shall keep the other Party informed of the status of any such suit or action and shall provide the other Party with copies, to the extent the Initiating Party is lawfully permitted to do so, of all material documents or communications filed in such suit or action. The Initiating Party shall have the sole and exclusive right to select counsel for any such suit or action.\n\nThe Initiating Party shall, except as provided below, pay all expenses of the suit or action, including the Initiating Party's attorneys' fees and court costs.

At the Initiating Party's written request, the other Party shall offer reasonable assistance to the Initiating Party in connection therewith at no charge to the Initiating Party except for reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the other Party in rendering such assistance. The other Party shall have the right to participate and be represented in any such suit or action by its own counsel at its own expense.\n\nThe Initiating Party may settle, consent judgment or otherwise voluntarily dispose of the suit or action (\"Settlement\") without the written consent of the other Party but only if such Settlement can be achieved without adversely affecting the other Party (including any of its Patent Rights). If a Settlement could adversely affect the other Party, then the written consent of the other Party would be required, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.   ***Confidential Treatment Requested***\n\n- 45 -\n\n\n\n\n\n12.8 Defense\n\nIf an action for infringement is commenced against either Party, its licensees or its sublicensees related to such Party's conduct of a Work Stream within the scope of an R&D Plan then such Party shall defend such action at its own expense, and the other Party shall assist and cooperate with such Party, at its own expense, to the extent necessary in the defense of such suit. The defending Party shall have the right to settle the suit or consent to an adverse judgment thereto, in its sole discretion, so long as such settlement or adverse judgment does not adversely affect the rights of the other Party and its Affiliates (including any patent rights Controlled by any of them). The defending Party shall assume full responsibility for the payment of any award for damages, or any amount due pursuant to any settlement entered into by it with such Third Party.\n\nIf the manufacture, use, importation, offer for sale or sale of any Products and Services results in any claim, suit or proceeding alleging patent infringement or trade secret misappropriation against FMI or a member of the Roche Group, then such Party shall promptly notify the other Party hereto. The Parties shall cooperate with each other in connection with any such claim, suit or proceeding and shall keep each other reasonably informed of all material developments in connection with any such claim, suit or proceeding.\n\nIf a Third Party asserts that Patent Rights owned by or licensed to it are infringed by the development, manufacture, use, importation, offer for sale or sale of products arising out of this Agreement by a member of the Roche Group, or that its trade secrets were misappropriated in connection with such activity, then Roche shall have the exclusive right and responsibility to resolve any such claim, whether by obtaining a license from such Third Party, by defending against such Third Party's claims or otherwise, and shall be solely responsible for the defense of any such action, any and all costs incurred in connection with such action (including, without limitation, attorneys' and expert fees) and all liabilities incurred in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the above, Roche shall not enter into any settlement of any such claim without the prior written consent of FMI if such settlement would require FMI to be subject to an injunction or to make any monetary payment to Roche or any Third Party, or admit any wrongful conduct by FMI or its Affiliates, or would limit or restrict the claims of or admit any invalidity and/or unenforceability of any of the Patent Rights Controlled by FMI, or have any impact on activities outside the Field.\n\n  12.9 Common Interest Disclosures\n\nWith regard to any information or opinions disclosed pursuant to this Agreement by one Party to each other regarding intellectual property and/or technology owned by Third Parties, the Parties agree that they have a common legal interest in determining whether, and to what extent, Third Party intellectual property rights may affect the conduct of the Work Streams and/or Products and Services, and have a further common legal interest in defending against any actual or prospective Third Party claims based on allegations of misuse or infringement of intellectual property rights relating to the conduct of the Work Streams and/or Products and Services. Accordingly, the Parties agree that all such information and materials obtained by FMI and Roche from each other will be used solely for purposes of the Parties' common legal interests with respect to the conduct of the Agreement. All information and materials will be treated as protected by the attorney-client privilege, the work product privilege, and any other privilege or   - 46 -\n\n\n\n\n\nimmunity that may otherwise be applicable. By sharing any such information and materials, neither Party intends to waive or limit any privilege or immunity that may apply to the shared information and materials. Neither Party shall have the authority to waive any privilege or immunity on behalf of the other Party without such other Party's prior written consent, nor shall the waiver of privilege or immunity resulting from the conduct of one Party be deemed to apply against any other Party.\n\n  13.

Obligation Not to Disclose Confidential Information\n\n16.1 Non-Use and Non-Disclosure\n\nDuring the Agreement Term and for [\u2026***\u2026] thereafter, a Receiving Party shall (i) treat Confidential Information provided by Disclosing Party as it would treat its own information of a similar nature, (ii) take all reasonable precautions not to disclose such Confidential Information   ***Confidential Treatment Requested***\n\n- 51 -\n\n\n\n\n\nto Third Parties, without the Disclosing Party's prior written consent, and (iii) not use such Confidential Information other than for fulfilling its obligations or exercising its rights under this Agreement. If any Confidential Information is required to be disclosed by the Receiving Party or its Affiliates to comply with a court or administrative order, the Receiving Party or its Affiliates, prior to making such disclosure, shall furnish as much notice as is reasonable under the circumstances to the Disclosing Party to enable it to resist such disclosure.\n\n  16.2 Permitted Disclosure\n\nNotwithstanding the obligation of non-use and non-disclosure set forth in Section 16.1, the Parties recognize the need for certain exceptions to this obligation, specifically set forth below, with respect to press releases, patent rights, publications, and certain commercial considerations.\n\n  16.3 Press Releases\n\nFollowing the Effective Date, the Parties will issue a joint press release announcing the existence and selected key terms of this Agreement, in a form substantially similar to the template attached as Appendix 16.3.\n\nEach Party shall provide the other with a copy of any draft press release related to the activities contemplated by this Agreement at least ten (10) Business Days prior to its intended publication for such other Party's review.

A Party (\"Publishing Party\") shall provide the other Party with a copy of any proposed publication or presentation at least [\u2026***\u2026] prior to submission for publication so as to provide such other Party with an opportunity to recommend any changes it reasonably believes are necessary to continue to maintain the Confidential Information disclosed by the other Party to the Publishing Party in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement. The incorporation of such recommended changes shall not be unreasonably refused; and if such other Party notifies (\"Publishing Notice\") the Publishing Party in writing, within [\u2026***\u2026] after receipt of the copy of the proposed publication or presentation, that such publication or presentation in its reasonable judgment (i) contains an invention, solely or jointly conceived and/or reduced to practice by the other Party, for which the other Party reasonably desires to obtain patent protection or (ii) could be expected to have a material adverse effect on the commercial value of any Confidential Information disclosed by the other Party to the Publishing Party, the Publishing Party shall prevent such publication or delay such publication for a mutually agreeable period of time. In the case of inventions, a delay shall be for a period reasonably sufficient to permit the timely preparation and filing of a patent application(s) on such invention, and in no event less than [\u2026 ***\u2026] from the date of the Publishing Notice.   ***Confidential Treatment Requested***\n\n- 52 -\n\n\n\n\n\n16.5 Commercial Considerations\n\nNothing in this Agreement shall prevent a Party or its Affiliates from disclosing Confidential Information of the other Party to (i) governmental agencies to the extent required or desirable to secure government approval for the development, manufacture or sale of a product in the Territory and (ii) Third Parties acting on behalf of a Party, to the extent reasonably necessary to conduct the activities contemplated by this Agreement provided that such Third Parties are bound by confidentiality obligations with respect to such information that are no less stringent than those included in this Agreement.\n\n  17. Term and Termination\n\n17.1 Commencement and Term\n\nThis Agreement shall commence upon the Effective Date and continue for the Agreement Term.\n\n  17.2 Termination\n\n  17.2.1 Termination for Breach\n\nA Party (\"Non-Breaching Party\") shall have the right to terminate this Agreement on a Work Stream-by-Work Stream basis, or, for Roche, on an Approved Marker or Investigational Marker basis in the case of the CDx Development Program, in the event the other Party (\"Breaching Party\") is in material breach of any of its material obligations under the applicable Work Stream (or obligations pertaining to an Approved Marker or Investigational Marker program). Failure of FMI to comply materially with Performance Specifications or Quality Standards shall be considered a material breach by FMI. For avoidance of doubt, a Non-Breaching Party shall only be permitted to terminate the Work Stream (or Approved Marker or Investigational Marker program) to which a material breach of a material obligation relates. The Non-Breaching Party shall provide written notice to the Breaching Party, which notice shall identify the breach. Except in the event of a breach that, by its nature, is not amenable to cure, in which case termination may be made effective immediately, the Breaching Party shall have a period of [\u2026***\u2026] after such written notice is provided (\"Peremptory Notice Period\") to cure such breach or, absent withdrawal of the Non-Breaching Party's request for termination, the relevant Work Stream (or Approved Marker or Investigational Marker program) shall terminate; provided that, if the Breaching Party has a bona fide dispute as to whether such breach: (i) occurred, (ii) pertains to a material obligation, or (iii) has been cured, the Breaching Party will so notify the Non-Breaching Party, the relevant Work Stream (or Approved Marker or Investigational Marker program) shall not terminate and the expiration of the Peremptory Notice Period shall be tolled until such dispute is resolved pursuant to Section 19.2. If such dispute is resolved by finding that the Non-Breaching Party is entitled to terminate the relevant Work Stream (or Approved Marker or Investigational Marker program), the Breaching Party may have the remainder of the Peremptory Notice Period to cure such breach. If such breach is not cured within the Peremptory Notice Period, then absent withdrawal of the Non-Breaching Party's request for termination, the relevant Work Stream (or Approved Marker or Investigational Marker program) shall terminate in accordance with the notice from the Non-Breaching Party as of the expiration of the Peremptory Notice Period.\n\n    17.2.2 Insolvency\n\nA Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, if the other Party incurs an Insolvency Event; provided, however, in the case of any involuntary bankruptcy proceeding, such right to   ***Confidential Treatment Requested***\n\n- 53 -\n\n\n\n\n\nterminate shall only become effective if the Party that incurs the Insolvency Event consents to the involuntary bankruptcy or such proceeding is not dismissed within [\u2026***\u2026] after the filing thereof.\n\n    17.2.3 Termination by Roche without Cause\n\nRoche shall have the right to terminate the Agreement in its entirety, or on a Work Stream-by-Work Stream basis, except for the ctDNA Work Stream, upon [\u2026***\u2026] prior written notice, without cause. With regard to the CDx Development Program, Roche shall also have the right to terminate, without cause, the development of an Approved Marker and/or an Investigational Marker for inclusion in a CDx Assay, upon [\u2026***\u2026] prior written notice; provided however that this right shall expire with respect to each Approved Marker for inclusion in a particular CDx Assay at such time as FMI has completed analytical validation for such Approved Marker. With regard to the Molecular Information Platform Program, Roche shall have the right to terminate without cause either or both of the Sample Profiling or Molecular Information Database Access activities individually.\n\n    17.2.4 Termination by Roche for Frustration of Purpose\n\nRoche shall have the right to terminate the ctDNA Platform Development Program upon [\u2026***\u2026] prior written notice for frustration of purpose in the event that the Clinical Study for which the ctDNA Assay is being developed is canceled.\n\n  17.3 Consequences of Termination\n\n  17.3.1 Termination in General\n\nUpon any termination of the Agreement, a Work Stream (or Approved Marker or Investigational Marker program), or this Agreement under Section 17.2.2, (i) FMI shall promptly return to Roche unused or remaining Samples that were provided for use in a terminated Work Stream (or related to the relevant Approved Marker or Investigational Marker), or, at Roche's option, securely dispose of all such unused or remaining Samples and provide Roche with a written notice of such disposal, (ii) each Party shall wind-down their activities under the Agreement in a manner that is intended to be expeditious and to mitigate losses arising from non-cancellable expenses and financial commitments to Third Parties, (iii) upon any termination by Roche under Section 17.2.3, or by FMI under Section 17.2.1 or Section 17.2.2, that includes the Immunotherapy Testing Platform Development Work Stream, the obligations in Section 3.2.8 shall terminate, (iv) each Party shall continue to Control its own intellectual property, including Patent Rights and Know-How, and Handle its own Patent Rights, and (v) Joint Patent Rights, if any, shall be handled by Roche subject to the provisions of Section 12.4 and 12.6, and each Party shall have the right to fully exploit such Joint Patent Rights.\n\n17.3.2 Termination by FMI for Breach by Roche or Roche's Insolvency; Termination by Roche Without Cause or for Frustration of Purpose\n\nUpon any termination by FMI for breach by Roche under Section 17.2.1, for Roche's Insolvency under Section 17.2.2, by Roche without cause under Section 17.2.3, or by Roche for frustration of purpose under Section 17.2.4:\n\n  (i) The rights and licenses granted by FMI to Roche hereunder shall terminate for the terminated Agreement, or Work Stream, orportion of the Work Stream (as applicable, the \"Terminated Matter\"), on the effective date of termination;   ***Confidential Treatment Requested***\n\n- 54 -\n\n\n\n\n\n  (ii) All licenses granted by Roche to FMI hereunder pertaining to the Terminated Matter become fully paid up, perpetual andirrevocable;\n\n\n\n(iii) Roche shall retain all licenses granted by FMI to Roche pertaining to intellectual property arising from work on the Terminated Matter prior to termination, provided, however, FMI shall be under no obligation to Handle any patent or patent application arising from Terminated Matters and may freely abandon (without offering Roche the right to Handle) or license (but, for clarity, not exclusively license or assign without Roche's consent if Roche retains license rights) such patent or patent application.\n\n  (iv) Within [\u2026***\u2026] after the effective date of termination and receipt by Roche of an invoice from FMI, Roche shall pay to FMI thefollowing amounts:\n\n\n\na. In the event of termination of the Molecular Information Platform Program Work Stream, Roche shall pay FMI all [\u2026 ***\u2026] that would be owed over the remainder of the Agreement Term, or any [\u2026***\u2026], plus any applicable incremental per Sample Profiling Fees for Sample Profiling performed by FMI during the year in which termination occurs that are [\u2026***\u2026];\n\n\n\nb. In the event of termination of the Immunotherapy Testing Platform Development Work Stream, (1) for avoidance of doubt, Roche shall pay FMI Roche's share of any FMI Development Costs incurred in connection with the Immunotherapy Testing Platform Development Work Stream as of the effective date of termination that were not previously paid by Roche; (2) (A) if the effective date of termination occurs prior to FMI's completion of the Immuno- Biomarker Discovery Platform, then Roche will pay FMI for the entirety of the FMI Development Costs FMI incurred in connection with FMI's performance of the Immunotherapy Testing Platform Development Work Stream, excluding any portion that was previously paid by Roche, or (B) if the effective date of termination occurs after FMI's commencement of Signature Identification services, then Roche will pay FMI for the entirety of the FMI Development Costs FMI incurred prior to the effective date of termination in connection with any ongoing performance of Signature Identification work by FMI, excluding any portion of such FMI Development Costs that was previously paid by Roche or that is payable by Roche under the foregoing clause (1); and (3) Roche shall pay FMI in accordance with Section 8.3.2 with respect to signatures developed by FMI prior to the effective date of termination.\n\n  c. In the event of termination of the ctDNA Platform Development Program Work Stream, Roche shall have no contractual payment obligation under this Section 17.3.2; provided, however, that Roche shall be obligated to honor payment obligations triggered prior to the effective date of termination;\n\n\n\nd. In the event of termination of the CDx Development Program Work Stream: for avoidance of doubt, Roche shall pay any FMI Development Costs in connection with the development of an Investigational Marker as specified by Section 8.5.1 incurred as of the effective date of termination that were not previously paid by Roche and any non-cancellable commitments reasonably incurred by FMI in   ***Confidential Treatment Requested***\n\n- 55 -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nanticipation of receiving PMA with regard to any Investigational Marker to the extent not re-allocable to FMI's other business activities, including without limitation, all accrued amounts under any individual CDx R&D Plan entered into by the Parties as described in Section 3.4.8 above; (ii) if the effective date of such termination is after FMI has completed analytical validation of any Investigational Marker for inclusion in a CDx Assay, then Roche shall remain obligated to pay a fee for each such terminated Investigational Marker equal to [\u2026***\u2026] upon PMA approval; and (iii) the milestone payments specified under Section 8.5.3 shall apply with respect to CDx Assays containing any Approved Marker and/or Investigational Marker; and\n\n  e. In the event of termination of the Agreement in its entirety under 17.2.2, Roche shall pay to FMI all amounts under theforegoing subsections (a) through (d) (inclusive) as applicable, if such fees become payable.\n\n\n\n(v) FMI shall retain all rights and remedies available to it under law and equity in connection with breach by Roche under Section 17.2.1 or other termination under Section 17.2.2, Section 17.2.3, or 17.2.4, provided, however, that in the case of termination of the Molecular Information Platform Program under Section 17.2.1 or Section 17.2.3 above, FMI's exclusive remedy (other than for breach of confidentiality under Section 16.1) shall be the accelerated payments specified under Section 17.3.2(iv)a.\n\nFor avoidance of doubt, in the event FMI terminates the Agreement in its entirety due to Roche's Insolvency, all Work Streams and other activities under the Agreement will be deemed to be terminated and all of the applicable effects of termination in this Section 17.3.2 shall apply.\n\n    17.3.3 Termination by Roche for Breach by FMI or FMI Insolvency\n\nUpon any termination by Roche for breach by FMI under Section 17.2.1 or FMI's Insolvency, under Section 17.2.2:\n\n  (i) The rights and licenses granted by Roche to FMI under Section 2.1 shall terminate for each terminated Work Stream, on theeffective date of termination, except that the rights granted to FMI under Section 2.1.2 shall survive such termination;\n\n  (ii) All licenses granted by FMI to Roche hereunder pertaining to a terminated Work Stream become fully paid up, perpetual andirrevocable;\n\n  (iii) The [\u2026***\u2026] under Section 3.2.10 shall survive termination of the Immunotherapy Testing Platform Development Work Stream;\n\n  (iv) The [\u2026***\u2026] under Section 3.3.9 shall survive termination of the ctDNA Platform Development Program Work Stream;\n\n  (v) Within [\u2026***\u2026] after the effective date of termination and receipt by Roche of an accounting from FMI, FMI shall pay to Roche any unused Reserved Capacity Fees and Database Access Fees previously paid pursuant to Section 8.2.1.1 or any other unused and pre-paid amounts;   ***Confidential Treatment Requested***\n\n- 56 -\n\n\n\n\n\n  (vi) FMI shall transfer to Roche all FMI Know-How, other than FMI Know-How pertaining to the Molecular Information Platform Program, necessary for Roche to practice the Terminated Matter, solely for the purposes or practicing the Terminated Matter, including any necessary algorithms; and\n\n  (vii) Roche shall retain all rights and remedies available to it under law and equity in connection with such breach by FMI.\n\nFor avoidance of doubt, in the event Roche terminates the Agreement in its entirety due to FMI's Insolvency, all Work Streams and other activities under the Agreement will be deemed to be terminated and all of the applicable effects of termination in this Section 17.3.3 shall apply.\n\n    17.3.4 Direct License\n\nIrrespective of anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any existing, permitted sublicense granted by a Party under this Agreement (and any further sublicenses thereunder) shall, upon a termination of the license granted hereunder that pertains to such sublicense, shall terminate; provided that if the licensee Party so requests in writing, the licensor Party shall negotiate with the relevant sublicensee towards the grant of a direct license of rights, provided that such sublicensee is not then in breach of its sublicense agreement with the licensee Party.\n\n  17.4 Other Obligations\n\nTermination of this Agreement by a Party, for any reason, shall not release Roche from any obligation to make payments to FMI that are due and payable prior to the effective date of termination.

All indemnification claims in respect of any Sanofi Indemnitee or RevMed Indemnitee seeking indemnity under Section 14.1 or Section 14.2 (collectively, the \"Indemnitees\" and each an \"Indemnitee\") will be made solely by the corresponding Party (the \"Indemnified Party\"). The Indemnified Party will give the indemnifying Party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") prompt written notice (an \"Indemnification Claim Notice\") of any Losses or discovery of fact upon which such Indemnified Party intends to base a request for indemnification under Section 14.1 or Section 14.2, but failure to provide prompt notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from its obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder except to the extent any Losses result from such delay in providing such notice. Each Indemnification Claim Notice must contain a description of the claim and the nature and amount of such Loss (to the extent that the nature and amount of such Loss are known at such time). Together with the Indemnification Claim Notice, the Indemnified Party will furnish promptly to the Indemnifying Party copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by any Indemnitee in connection with the Third Party Claim.\n\n(b) Control of Defense. At its option, the Indemnifying Party may assume the defense of any Third Party Claim subject to indemnification as provided for in Section 14.1 or Section 14.2 by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within [***] after the Indemnifying Party's receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice. Upon assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may select and appoint the lead legal counsel for the defense of the Third Party Claim. Should the Indemnifying Party assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the Indemnified Party or any other Indemnitee for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party or other Indemnitee in connection with the analysis, defense or settlement of the Third Party Claim. 72\n\nSource: REVOLUTION MEDICINES, INC., S-1, 1/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Right to Participate in Defense. Without limiting Section 14.3(b), any Indemnitee will be entitled to participate in, but not control, the defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided, however, that such employment will be at the Indemnitee's own expense unless (a) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Indemnifying Party in writing, or (b) the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel in accordance with Section 14.3(b) (in which case the Indemnified Party will control the defense).\n\n(d) Settlement. With respect to any Losses relating solely to the payment of money damages in connection with a Third Party Claim and that will not result in the Indemnitee's becoming subject to injunctive or other relief or otherwise adversely affect the business of the Indemnitee in any manner, and as to which the Indemnifying Party has acknowledged in writing the obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder, the Indemnifying Party will have the sole right to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss, on such terms as the Indemnifying Party, in its sole discretion, will deem appropriate. The Indemnifying Party will pay all amounts on behalf of the Indemnified Party at or prior to the time of the entry of judgment. With respect to all other Losses in connection with Third Party Claims, where the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 14.3(b), the Indemnifying Party will have authority to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss provided it obtains the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will be at the Indemnified Party's sole and absolute discretion). The Indemnifying Party that has assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 14.3(b) will not be liable for any settlement or other disposition of a Loss by an Indemnitee that is reached without the written consent of such Indemnifying Party. Regardless of whether the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, no Indemnitee will admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third Party Claim without first offering to the Indemnifying Party the opportunity to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 14.3(b).\n\n(e) Cooperation. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will, and will cause each other Indemnitee to, cooperate in the defense thereof and will furnish such records, information and testimony, provide such witnesses and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested in connection with the defense of such Third Party Claim. Such cooperation will include access during normal business hours afforded to the Indemnifying Party to, and reasonable retention by the Indemnified Party of, records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making Indemnitees and other employees and agents available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket costs in connection with such cooperation.\n\n(f) Expenses. Except as provided above, the reasonable and verifiable costs and expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with any claim will be reimbursed on a [***] by the Indemnifying Party, without prejudice to the Indemnifying Party's right to contest the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification and subject to refund in the event the Indemnifying Party is ultimately held not to be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party. 73\n\nSource: REVOLUTION MEDICINES, INC., S-1, 1/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n14.4 Mitigation of Loss. Each Indemnified Party shall take and shall procure that its Affiliates take all such reasonable steps and action as are reasonably necessary or as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably require in order to mitigate any Third Party Claims (or potential losses or damages) under this Article XIV. Nothing in this Agreement shall or shall be deemed to relieve any Party of any common law or other duty to mitigate any losses incurred by it.\n\n14.5 Limitation of Liability. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF ANY NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 14.5 IS INTENDED TO OR SHALL LIMIT OR RESTRICT THE INDEMNIFICATION RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS OF ANY PARTY UNDER SECTION 14.1 OR SECTION 14.2, OR DAMAGES AVAILABLE FOR A PARTY'S BREACH OF ITS OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO CONFIDENTIALITY UNDER ARTICLE XI OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY UNDER ARTICLE X.\n\n14.6 Insurance. Each Party shall procure and maintain insurance, including product liability insurance, with respect to its activities hereunder and under the Ancillary Agreements and which is consistent with normal business practices of companies similarly situated at all times during which any SHP2 Inhibitors or Product is being clinically tested in human subjects or commercially distributed or sold. Sanofi may fulfill such obligation through self- insurance. Each Party shall provide the other Party with evidence of such insurance upon request and, in the case of RevMed, shall provide Sanofi with written notice at least [***] prior to the cancellation, non-renewal or material changes in such insurance. It is understood that such insurance shall not be construed to create a limit of either Party's liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this Article XIV.\n\nArticle XV.\n\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n15.1 Force Majeure. Neither Party shall be held liable to the other Party nor be deemed to have defaulted under or breached this Agreement for failure or delay in performing any obligation under this Agreement to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from causes beyond the reasonable control of the affected Party, including embargoes, war, acts of war (whether war be declared or not), acts of terrorism, insurrections, riots, civil commotions, strikes, lockouts or other labor disturbances (whether involving the workforce of the nonperforming Party or of any other Person), fire, floods, earthquakes or other acts of God, or acts, generally applicable action or inaction by any governmental authority (but excluding any government action or inaction that is specific to such Party, its Affiliates or Sublicensees, such as revocation or non-renewal of such Party's license to conduct business), or omissions or delays in acting by the other Party, or unavailability of materials related to the Manufacture of the Products (each cause, an event of \"Force Majeure\"). The affected Party shall give notice to the other Party in writing as soon as reasonably practical but no later than [***] after the occurrence of the event of Force Majeure, specifying the nature and extent of the event of Force Majeure, its anticipated duration and any 74\n\nSource: REVOLUTION MEDICINES, INC., S-1, 1/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n\naction being taken to avoid or minimize its effect. The suspension of performance allowed hereunder shall be of no greater scope and no longer duration than is reasonably required, and the affected Party shall promptly undertake and continue diligently all reasonable efforts necessary to cure such force majeure circumstances or to perform its obligations in spite of the ongoing circumstances. In the event that RevMed is the non-performing Party and the Force Majeure continues for more than [***] (which period, in its entirety or a portion thereof, is prior to the commencement of the Registration Program for a Product, which Development thereof is impacted by such Force Majeure), Sanofi's payment obligations under Article IX shall be suspended until notification by RevMed to Sanofi of the termination of such Force Majeure Event (and any related triggers and deadlines shall be similarly suspended).\n\n15.2 Assignment; Change of Control.\n\n(a) Neither Party may assign this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations hereunder, except as expressly permitted hereunder, or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, whether by operation of law or otherwise, in whole or in part, without the consent of the other Party, except as follows:\n\n(i) Sanofi may, without consent of RevMed, assign this Agreement or its rights and obligations hereunder in whole or in part to any Affiliate of Sanofi, and RevMed may, with the consent of Sanofi (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), assign this Agreement or its rights and obligations hereunder in whole or in part to any Affiliate of RevMed; and\n\n(ii) Either Party may, without consent of the other Party, assign this Agreement in whole to (i) in the case of RevMed, its successor in interest or assignee or purchaser, as applicable, in the case of a Change of Control or (ii) in the case of Sanofi, its successor in interest or assignee or purchaser, as applicable, in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of its assets to which this Agreement relates, or in connection with a merger, acquisition or similar transaction.

Any attempted assignment not in accordance with this Section 15.2 shall be null and void and of no legal effect. Any permitted assignee shall assume all assigned obligations of its assignor under this Agreement. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the Parties and their respected successors and permitted assigns. For clarity, any assignment by Sanofi shall be subject to Section 9.7(a).\n\n(b) Except as part of a transaction permitted under this Section 15.2, in no event shall RevMed assign or transfer, or agree to assign or transfer to any Third Party, any or all of the RevMed Licensed Patents without the consent of Sanofi, not be unreasonably withheld or conditioned.\n\n15.3 Severability.
