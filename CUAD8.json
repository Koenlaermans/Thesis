To the extent  that such headcount reductions are effected through compulsory redundancies which affect the Transferring Employees,  DCL understands that SEV will seek to establish that such redundancies are for an economic technical or organisational  reason entailing a change in the workforce. Accordingly, DCL agrees that (subject to Clause 11.7) in the event that SEV  terminates the employment of any of the Transferring Employees on the ground of redundancy and:-     11.6.1 the date on which the applicable redundancy notice is issued falls on or within a period of 6 months commencing on  and including the Commencement Date; and     11.6.2 a copy of such redundancy notice is served (in accordance with clause 32.1) upon DCL within the same period;     then DCL will reimburse the Redundancy Costs validly incurred by SEV in association with such termination(s) to SEV  within 14 days of receipt of an invoice from SEV detailing the name of the Transferring Employee, the effective date of  termination of their employment and the date and amount of any payment of the Redundancy Costs (including a  breakdown of PAYE deducted).     11.7 DCL will reimburse Redundancy Costs to SEV in accordance with Clause 11.6 up to a maximum total sum as set out in  Schedule Two (\"the Redundancy Cap\"). However, in the event that the basis of calculation of the Redundancy Costs  applicable to all or any of the Transferring Employees as stated in Schedule Two (\"the Anticipated Redundancy Costs\") is  challenged (whether by one or more of the Transferring Employees or by any trade union, staff association or staff body  recognised by DCL or SEV in respect of all or any of the Transferring Employees) with the result that the Anticipated  Redundancy Costs are agreed by the parties or adjudged by a competent court or tribunal to be less than the actual  Redundancy Costs (\"the Actual Redundancy Costs\"), DCL agrees to forthwith pay to SEV in addition to the Anticipated  Redundancy Costs such sum as represents the difference between the Anticipated Redundancy Costs and the Actual  Redundancy Costs; provided that DCL's liability in respect of such difference shall not exceed the sum of [***]     [***]     11.8 SEV will for the purposes of its accounts and tax return consider whether any payment received from DCL under the terms of  Clause 11.6 can be treated as a non taxable income receipt with a claim being made for the Redundancy Costs as deductible  for corporation tax purposes. Provided SEV considers that there are reasonable grounds     15\n\n\n\n\n\n     ***Confidential treatment requested pursuant to a request for confidential treatment filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Application of the Regulations     18.1 SEV and DCL anticipate that the Regulations will apply in respect of the termination of the Agreement and the subsequent transfer of  the Maintenance Services to DCL and/or to a Replacement Supplier. However, should the Regulations not apply for whatever  reason, SEV and DCL agree to nevertheless act in accordance with, and be bound by, the Regulations.     22\n\n\n\n\n\n     ***Confidential treatment requested pursuant to a request for confidential treatment filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

If the Regulations do not apply at the Termination Date     19.1 If the Regulations do not apply to the full or partial termination or expiry of this Agreement (for any reason) then the provisions of  this Clause 19 shall apply.     19.2 DCL shall offer (or where applicable) procure that the Replacement Supplier offers employment to any employee of SEV who is wholly  or mainly assigned to work in the provision of the Maintenance Service immediately prior to the Termination Date (\"Future  Agreed Transferring Employees\"); such offer in each case to:     19.2.1 commence on the day immediately following the date on which the Agreement terminates,     19.2.2 be on terms no less favourable than the terms on which the Future Agreed Regulation Transferring Employees are  engaged by SEV immediately before the termination of this Agreement;     19.2.3 be made in writing and copied to SEV     20. If the Regulations do apply at the Termination Date     20.1 If the Regulations do apply to the full or partial termination or expiry of this Agreement (for any reason) then DCL and SEV  acknowledge and agree that, pursuant to the Regulations, the contracts of employment between SEV and the Future  Transferring Employees (except in so far as such contracts relate to any occupational pension scheme as defined in Regulation 7  of the Regulations) will have effect after the Termination Date as if originally made between the DCL and/or any Replacement  Supplier and the Future Transferring Employees.     20.2 DCL shall provide (or, if appropriate shall procure the provision by the Replacement Supplier of) such information as may be  requested by SEV in order to comply with its duties of information and consultation under the Regulations and under sections  259-261 of the Pensions Act 2004.     20.3 SEV will from the Termination Date keep DCL and/or any Replacement Supplier indemnified in full against all Liabilities arising directly  or indirectly in connection with:     20.3.1 SEV's failure to inform or consult as required under Regulation 10 of the Regulations except to the extent that any such  action or claim (or any part of     23\n\n\n\n\n\n     ***Confidential treatment requested pursuant to a request for confidential treatment filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Omitted  portions have been filed separately with the Commission.     such action or claim) arises from any failure by DCL or any Replacement Supplier to give SEV the information required  from DCL or any Replacement Supplier to enable SEV to comply with its obligations under the Regulations;     20.3.2 any claim by a Future Transferring Employee that such person is entitled for any reason to take benefits (other than  benefits relating to old age, invalidity or survivorship) pursuant to the terms of any pension scheme in which DCL or  any Replacement Supplier is not then participating, or pursuant to the Future Transferring Employee's terms and  conditions of employment prior to Termination Date.     21. Step in rights     21.1 If SEV fails to provide part or all of the Maintenance Services in accordance with this Agreement in any material respect. DCL may  notify SEV that it intends to exercise its rights under this Clause 21. DCL agrees that it shall provide SEV with notice of its  intention to exercise this Clause and shall provide SEV with a reasonable opportunity to rectify the failure to provide  Maintenance Services to the satisfaction of Dairy Crest.     21.2 DCL shall notify SEV of the reasonable costs to be incurred by DCL in the event that this Clause 21 is exercised by DCL.     21.3 If SEV does not substantially remedy the failure within a reasonable period of the notice referred to in Clause 21.1 (not to exceed 15  days), DCL may itself provide or may employ and pay a third party supplier to provide the Maintenance Services or any part of  the Maintenance Services. DCL's reasonable costs in doing this may, at DCL's option, be deducted from any sums due to the  SEV or shall be recoverable from SEV by DCL as a debt.     21.4 To the extent to which the Maintenance Services are being provided by DCL or a third party supplier under Clause 21.3, SEV will be  relieved of its obligations to provide the Maintenance Services. SEV will not be liable for the acts or omissions of DCL or the  third party supplier in providing the Maintenance Services.     21.5 DCL shall permit SEV to resume delivery of the Maintenance Services once it is satisfied on reasonable grounds that SEV will be able  to resume delivery of the Maintenance Services in accordance with this Agreement.     21.6 SEV shall co-operate in all reasonable respects with DCL and any third party supplier engaged by DCL under this Clause.     22. Insurance     22.1 SEV shall maintain in force (at its own expense) for the term of this agreement and for six years after its termination:     24\n\n\n\n\n\n     ***Confidential treatment requested pursuant to a request for confidential treatment filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Legal status     SEV is an independent contractor and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a partnership or any employment  relationship between the parties nor shall anything in this Agreement be deemed to constitute one party the agent of the other for any  purpose.     24. Force Majeure     24.1 SEV shall not be liable for any breach of its obligations hereunder resulting from causes beyond its reasonable control including but  not limited to fires, insurrection or riots, embargoes, inability to obtain supplies and raw materials due to strikes or market  shortages (acknowledged by DCL) affecting the relevant third party suppliers, or regulations of any civil or military authority (an  \"Event of Force Majeure\").     24.2 If a default due to an Event of Force Majeure shall continue for more than eight wooks then the party not in default shall be entitled  to terminate this Agreement on giving written notice to the other party. Neither party shall have any liability to the other in  respect of the termination of this Agreement as a result of an Event of Force Majeure. However, any termination of this  Agreement shall not affect any liability of DCL to discharge any Maintenance Charges and/or Additional Charges outstanding  at that time.     25. Invalidity and Severability     Each of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall be construed as independent of every other such provision, so that if any  provision of this Agreement shall be found by any Court or administrative body of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable  the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the other provisions of this Agreement and all provisions not affected  by such invalidity or unenforceability shall remain in full force and effect     25\n\n\n\n\n\n     ***Confidential treatment requested pursuant to a request for confidential treatment filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

APPENDIX     Code of Practice on Acceptable Standards of Maintenance     The Department of Transport accepts that many operators, particularly those new to the profession, are unaware of what is needed to meet the  required standards, and have issued, in consultation with representatives of the industry a Code of Practice to provide guidance for operators on  what is needed for good maintenance. The Code is entitled Guide to Maintaining Roadworthiness, and is published by HMSO.     The Preface to the Code repeats the caveat in the Department's Guide to Operator Licensing that the ultimate test of an operator's maintenance  system is the condition of his vehicles on the road.     It assures operators that if their maintenance systems accord with the Code they will be acceptable to Traffic Commissioners, providing the  resulting condition of their vehicles is satisfactory. However, it adds a rider that Traffic Commissioners remain free to require more stringent  arrangements than those which the operator proposes.     Advice contained in the code     The Code offers much sensible advice on what is acceptable. It thus fills the gap which previously existed between the legal requirement for safe  operation and the means by which this can be fulfilled. The Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) is now much more specific than  hitherto about these means.     VOSA examiners have always been prepared to visit operators and advise them on their maintenance. The VOSA is now an Executive Agency with  a commercial remit, self funded by the fees it charges for inspections it provides for a commercial fee, courses for goods vehicle operators' staffs  responsible for inspecting vehicles.     The Code places considerable emphasis on regular inspections of vehicles, including a daily \"walkround check\", the keeping of records of  inspections (Croners' Road Transport Operation: Records and Procedures gives valuable information on the types of records to be kept), and the  importance of driver defect reports (including the making of NIL Defects reports where appropriate).     The practice of keeping defect reports and records of inspection for 15 months is confirmed in the Code.     A clear indication is given that safety inspections should follow a pattern based on time, and that the interval of time between inspections should  be determined by operating conditions.     Operators are advised to own or have access to means of measuring braking efficiency. The VOSA is currently offering, on an experimental basis,  this facility to operators at some goods vehicle testing stations.     32\n\n\n\n\n\n     ***Confidential treatment requested pursuant to a request for confidential treatment filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Omitted  portions have been filed separately with the Commission.     Maintenance Staff     Vehicle maintenance must be carried out by qualified maintenance staff so that the driver is well supported in his operational duties thus enabling  him to give maximum productivity during his working hours.     Fleet maintenance should be planned, with regular vehicle testing and inspection, to minimise breakdowns on the road and to assist maximum  vehicle utilisation.     The Driver's Responsibilities     The driver is the operator's representative and as such is responsible \u2014 with his employer \u2014 for any infringement of the law and he should  therefore have a working knowledge of the appropriate regulations.     Whatever the standards laid down by vehicle operators for maintenance and servicing, ultimately it is the driver who is responsible for reporting  on performances He, more than anyone else, handles the vehicle under load, which is the only time when a true test of vehicle performance can be  obtained. The driver, therefore, must ensure that he reports in good time, to the maintenance staff, any defects likely to infringe the law or affect  the safety requirements. For such purposes a Vehicle Defects Report Sheet should be supplied by the operator to his driver so that any  abnormalities can be recorded and dealt with as soon as possible.     The items for checking and reporting on the Defects Report Sheet are:     (a) fuel, oil and water     (b) brakes     (c) tyre condition and inflation pressures, spare wheel and jack     (d) wheel security, making sure that:     (i) all nuts and studs are tight     (ii) no nuts or studs are missing     (iii) no cracks are evident around wheel holes and where the centre joins the rim     (iv) where a wheel has been replaced recently the nuts are tight (these should be checked again after 30 minutes of the work being carried out)     Note: A vehicle should not be moved if any problems are found which should be reported immediately.     (e) driving mirrors, windscreen wipers and washers     (f) lights and reflectors     (g) stop-lights and direction indicators      (h) steering     33\n\n\n\n\n\n  ***Confidential treatment requested pursuant to a request for confidential treatment filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Omitted  portions have been filed separately with the Commission.     (i) the tachograph instrument     (j) care and attention of batteries     (k) all controls within the cab (lighting controls and connections)     (l) water-cooling system and the use of anti-freeze     (m) fuel supply, checking and clearing air-locks (diesel fuel system)     (n) spray suppression equipment-around wheels     (o) sideguards and rear under-run guards     (p) cold starting procedure     (q) brake and light coupling systems (trailer and articulated vehicles)     (r) special equipment and controls used with tankers, tail-lifts, autocranes, etc.     (s) refrigeration systems and controls     (t) speed limiters.     Note. Headlamps, front and rear fog lamps, reversing lamps (if fitted) must be set so they do not cause dazzle to other road users Also, all  obligatory lamps and reflectors (including rear reflective markings) must be kept clean and in good working order.     34\n\n\n\n\n\n     ***Confidential treatment requested pursuant to a request for confidential treatment filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Confidentiality. \"Confidential Information\" means any tangible and intangible non-public information in any form (including written information, oral statements and electronically stored data) which a party discloses (the \"Discloser\") to the other party (the \"Recipient\") including, without limitation, information relating to trade secrets, systems, know-how, products, processes (including manufacturing processes), inventions, computer software programs, marketing or sales techniques, financial condition, costs, business interests, initiatives, objectives, plans, strategies, customers, suppliers, lenders, underwriters, or employees, that is marked as confidential or identified at the time of disclosure as being confidential or is otherwise disclosed under circumstances that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that such information is confidential, excluding information that: (a) was in Recipient's possession before receipt from the Discloser pursuant this Agreement; (b) is in or enters the public domain without a breach of this Agreement; (c) is rightfully received by Recipient from a third party who was not known by Recipient to be legally or contractually restricted from disclosing such information; or (d) is independently developed by Recipient without use of or reference to the Discloser's Confidential Information. Recipient will protect the Confidential Information, for one (1) year from the date of disclosure, by using at least the same degree of care as it uses to protect its own Confidential Information, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent unauthorized use, disclosure or publication. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Recipient is required by applicable Law or a valid legal order to disclose any Confidential Information, Recipient shall, before such disclosure, notify Discloser of such requirements, if legally permissible and reasonably practicable, so that Discloser may seek a protective order or other remedy, and Recipient shall reasonably assist Discloser therewith (at Discloser's cost). If Recipient remains legally compelled to make such disclosure, it shall only disclose that portion of the Confidential Information Recipient is required to disclose. Without limiting the foregoing, Recipient: (x) will not use, disclose, make available or reproduce the Confidential Information (or permit others to do so) except as expressly authorized in this Agreement; (y) will not disclose any such Confidential Information to anyone except employees and directors of Recipient to whom disclosure is necessary for the performance of the Agreement; and (z) will appropriately notify such employees and directors that the disclosure is made in confidence and will be kept in confidence in accordance with this Agreement. If Recipient becomes aware of any loss or unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information, Recipient will promptly notify Discloser of such and use reasonable efforts to retrieve such Confidential Information.\n\n\n\n\n\n13. Disclaimer. Except as expressly set forth herein, the Services are provided on an \"as is,\" \"where is,\" and \"as available\" basis, and, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, Kubient disclaims, and Customer hereby waives, all representations and warranties, express or implied, arising by operation of Law or otherwise, except for the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, as well as any warranties arising from a course of dealing, usage or trade practice. Kubient makes no representation or warranty and expressly disclaims, and Customer understands and acknowledges, that there is no guarantee that any minimum level of revenue or profit will be generated by either Party as a result of the Services or this Agreement. 14. General Provisions. (a) This Agreement is governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to its conflict of laws principles. Each Party hereby irrevocably submits for all disputes to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in New York, New York. (b) Each Party's names, trademarks and logos are the exclusive property of said respective Party, and neither Party will acquire any proprietary rights therein by reason of this Agreement or any other agreement.

(c) The relationship of the Parties is that of independent contractors, and nothing herein is intended, nor should be construed, to create a partnership, agency, joint venture or employment relationship. No act or statement of either Party will operate to bind the other and neither Party will hold itself out or have any authority as an agent of the other for any purposes whatsoever. (d) If any legal action, including, without limitation, an action for arbitration or injunctive relief, is brought relating to the Agreement or in breach hereof, the prevailing party in any final judgment or arbitration award shall be entitled to recover its reasonable expenses, including all court costs, arbitration fees and reasonable attorney's fees. (e) All notices provided pursuant to this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed given (i) if by personal delivery, upon receipt thereof; (ii) if mailed five 5 days after deposit in the US mail, postage prepaid, certified mail return receipt requested; or (iii) if sent via overnight courier, upon receipt. All notices will be sent to the person who has signed this Agreement (at the address set forth above) or to such other person or address as either party may specify in writing. (f) If any provision of this Agreement is unenforceable, illegal or invalid under any applicable Law or court of competent jurisdiction, then such unenforceability or invalidity will not render the Agreement unenforceable or invalid. In such event, such provision will be deemed restated in accordance with applicable Law to reflect as nearly as possible the original intentions of the parties, and the remainder of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Provisions that should reasonably be considered to survive termination of the Agreement will survive and be enforceable after such termination or expiration, including without limitation provisions relating to confidentiality, proprietary rights, indemnification, limitations of liability, effects of termination, and governing Law. The delay or failure of either Party to exercise any right or power provided in this Agreement or to require performance by the other Party of any provision of this Agreement will not impair such right or power, or be deemed a waiver thereof. A waiver by either Party of any covenants to be performed by the other or any breach thereof will not be taken or held to be a waiver of any succeeding breach thereof or of any other covenant contained in this Agreement or under any agreement. (g) Neither Party will be liable under this Agreement by reason of any damages, failure or delays in the performance of its obligations under such Agreement (except for the payment of money) on account of any cause beyond the reasonable control of such Party, such as fire, explosion, power failures, pest damage, lightning or power surges, strikes or labor disputes, water, war, civil disturbances, terrorism, acts of civil or military authorities, inability to secure raw materials, transportation facilities, fuel or energy shortages, performance or availability of communications services or networks and network facilities failures of any suppliers or service providers, or other causes beyond the Party's reasonable control. (h) Neither Party may assign (voluntarily, by operation of law, or otherwise) this Agreement or any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the other Party's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided however, that either Party may assign this Agreement without approval or consent to any affiliate or purchaser of all or substantially all of said Party's assets related to the subject matter of this Agreement or to any successor by way of merger, stock sale, consolidation or similar transaction. Any attempted assignment other than in accordance herewith will be void. Subject to the foregoing, the Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. The Agreement completely and exclusively states the agreement of the Parties regarding its subject matter. This Agreement supersedes, and its terms govern, all prior proposals, agreements, or other communications between the parties, oral or written, regarding its subject matter. (i) This Agreement is intended for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Parties hereto, is not intended to confer any rights or benefits on any third party, and only the Parties may enforce such Agreement. This Agreement shall be binding on both Parties when signed on behalf of each Party, and may be signed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and both of which when taken together will constitute one and the same agreement. Fax or electronically scanned copies of such executed documents may be used in lieu of the originals for any purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed by their duly authorized representatives as of the dates written below.

In lieu thereof, a Party shall provide the other Party with a tax or levy exemption certificate acceptable to the taxing or levying authority.\n\n     10.9 AUDITS. During the 18-month period following the payment by one Party of any amount due under this Agreement to the other Party, the Party receiving payment (the \"Auditing Party\") shall have the right, at its own expense, to have an independent \"Big Five\" accounting firm (the \"Auditor\") audit the financial records of the other Party (the \"Audited Party\") relating to such payment to verify the accuracy of the Audited Party's financial records in order to verify the amount of the payments owed and/or paid. The Auditing Party may cause the Auditor to perform such an audit not more than once in any 12-month period, unless a prior audit within the past two years revealed that the amount owed by the Audited Party to the Auditing Party was underpaid in excess of 8% of the amount owed, in which case an audit may be performed no more frequently than twice in any 12-month period. If the amount owed by the Audited Party to\n\n*Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the  Commission.

If the amount owed by the Audited Party to the Auditing Party was underpaid in excess of 10% of the amount owed, the fees of such audit shall also be paid to the Auditing Party within 15 days of notice of such to the Audited Party. If the amount owed by the Audited Party to the Auditing Party was overpaid, the Auditing Party shall return the excess amount paid to the Auditing Party within 15 days of notice of such underpayment to the Auditing Party. The Auditing Party shall give reasonable advance written notice to the Audited Party, and each audit shall be conducted during normal business hours and in a manner that does not cause unreasonable disruption to the conduct of business by the Audited Party.\n\n     10.10 INTEREST. All payments not paid by the date such payments are due shall bear interest from the due date to the date payments are actually paid at the rate of the lower of (a) 1% per month or (b) the maximum rate permitted by law.\n\n11. TERM AND TERMINATION\n\n     11.1 AUTOMATIC RENEWAL. This Agreement will automatically renew at the end of the Initial Term or a subsequent renewal term on a year to year basis (each, a \"Renewal Term\"), unless either Party notifies the other at least 30 days prior to the end of the Initial Term or then current Renewal Term, as applicable, of its intention not to renew this Agreement (a \"Termination Notice\").\n\nSource: NEOFORMA INC, S-1/A, 12/2/1999\n\n\n\n\n\n     11.2 TERMINATION FOR CAUSE. Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to the other Party in the event any material breach of a material term of this Agreement by such other Party that remains uncured 30 days in the case of a breach of a payment obligation, or 45 days for all other breaches, after notice of such breach was received by such other Party; provided, however that if such breach is not reasonably capable of cure within the applicable cure period, the breaching Party shall have an additional 180 days to cure such breach so long as the cure is commenced within the applicable cure period and thereafter is diligently prosecuted to completion as soon as possible.\n\n     11.3 UPON TERMINATION. Upon termination of this Agreement, (a) each Party's liability for any charges, payments or expenses due to the other Party that accrued prior to the date of termination shall not be extinguished by termination, and such amounts (if not otherwise due on an earlier date) shall be immediately due and payable on the termination date; (b) VerticalNet shall be responsible for all charges, payments or expenses incurred by it in connection with the removal of the Neoforma Links, Neoforma Content and Neoforma Product Listings from the Co-Branded Sites and all other VerticalNet Sites; (c) Neoforma shall be responsible for all charges, payments or expenses incurred by it in connection with the removal of the VerticalNet Links, VerticalNet Content and VerticalNet Product Listings from the Neoforma Sites; (d) all rights of Neoforma to use, display, reproduce or publish the VerticalNet Marks shall immediately cease, (e) all rights of VerticalNet to use, display, reproduce or publish the Neoforma Marks shall immediately cease, (f) all rights of Neoforma to use, display, reproduce and transmit the VerticalNet Content and VerticalNet Product Listings shall immediately cease and Neoforma shall, at VerticalNet's cost, return one copy of the VerticalNet Content and VerticalNet Product Listings for Medical Products to VerticalNet in electronic format and destroy all other copies of\n\n                                    17    18\n\nsuch content, (g) all rights of VerticalNet to use, create derivative works of, reproduce, display, perform and transmit the Neoforma Content and Neoforma Product Listings shall immediately cease and VerticalNet shall, at Neoforma's cost, return one copy of the Neoforma Content and the Neoforma Product Listings for Laboratory Products to Neoforma in electronic format and destroy all other copies of such content, (h) all rights of VerticalNet to arrange for the sale of advertising on the Neoforma Sites shall immediately cease, (i) VerticalNet shall retain ownership of the domain names and URLs at which the VerticalNet Sites (including, but not limited to, the Co-Branded Sites) are located, and (j) Neoforma shall retain ownership of the domain names and URLs at which the Neoforma Sites (including, but not limited to Neoforma Plan and Neoforma Shop) are located. If a Termination Notice is sent, the parties shall promptly meet to discuss a phase-out of the Co-Branded Sites and all Links and transfers of Product Listings set forth herein.\n\n12. DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n     12.1 NEGOTIATION AND ESCALATION. If any controversy or claim arises relating to this Agreement, the Parties will attempt in good faith to negotiate a solution to their differences, including progressively escalating any controversy or claim through senior levels of management. If negotiation does not result in a resolution within 30 days of when one Party first notifies the other of the controversy or claim, either Party may resort to arbitration under Section 12.2  [ARBITRATION].\n\n     12.2 ARBITRATION. Any controversy or claim between the Parties concerning any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or performance or nonperformance of any obligation under this Agreement which cannot be resolved by negotiation will be resolved by binding arbitration under this Section 12.2  [ARBITRATION] and the then-current Commercial Rules and supervision of the American Arbitration Association (the \"AAA\"). If any part of this Section 12.2  [ARBITRATION] is held to be unenforceable, it will be severed and will not affect either the duty to arbitrate or any other part of this Section 12.2  [ARBITRATION]. The arbitration will be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, before a sole disinterested arbitrator who is knowledgeable in business information and the Internet and experienced in handling commercial disputes. The arbitrator shall be appointed jointly by the Parties hereto within 30 days following the date on which the arbitration is instituted. If the Parties are unable to agree upon the arbitrator within such 30-day period, the AAA shall be instructed to select such arbitrator within 15 days thereafter. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator will not have the power to award punitive or exemplary damages, or any damages excluded by, or in excess of, any damage limitations expressed in this Agreement. Issues of arbitrability will be determined in accordance solely with the federal substantive and procedural laws relating to arbitration; in all other respects, the arbitrator will be obligated to apply and follow the substantive law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n\n     12.3 EQUITABLE RELIEF. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event of an alleged violation of Article 13  [CONFIDENTIALITY] of this Agreement by either Party, the Party alleging such a violation may seek temporary injunctive or other appropriate equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction pending appointment of an arbitrator. The Party requesting such relief shall simultaneously file a demand for arbitration of the dispute, and shall\n\n                                    18    19\n\nrequest that the American Arbitration Association proceed under its rules for an expedited hearing.\n\n     12.4 COSTS. Unless the arbitrator, if any, determines otherwise, each Party will bear its own attorneys' fees and other costs associated with the negotiation and arbitration provided for by this Article 12  [DISPUTE RESOLUTION], except that costs and expenses of the arbitrators shall be shared equally. If court proceedings to stay litigation or compel arbitration are necessary, the Party who unsuccessfully opposes such proceedings will pay all associated costs, expenses and attorneys' fees that are reasonably incurred by the other Party.\n\n     12.5 TWO YEAR LIMITATION. Except for claims under Sections 15.4  [INDEMNIFICATION BY NEOFORMA] and 15.5  [INDEMNIFICATION BY VERTICALNET] hereof, neither Party may bring a claim or action regardless of form, arising out of or related to this Agreement, including any claim of fraud or misrepresentation, more than two years after the cause of action accrues or\n\nSource: NEOFORMA INC, S-1/A, 12/2/1999\n\n\n\n\n\nbecomes known, whichever is later.\n\n     12.6 CONFIDENTIALITY. In order to facilitate the resolution of controversies or claims between the Parties with respect to each Party hereto, such controversies or claims, including details regarding negotiations, arbitration and settlement terms, shall be treated as Confidential Information of the other Party hereto in accordance with Article 13  [CONFIDENTIALITY].\n\n     12.7 REMEDIAL MEASURES. In the event of (a) any material remediable breach of this Agreement by the other Party which remains uncured 30 days after notice of such breach (other than a breach of a payment obligation) was received by the other Party or (b) any material breach which cannot be cured, the non-breaching Party may take reasonable remediable measures at the cost of the breaching Party without prejudice and in addition to any other rights arising from such breach. In addition, the non-breaching Party shall take reasonable steps to mitigate damages arising out of such breach.\n\n13. CONFIDENTIALITY\n\n     13.1 CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS. Except as permitted elsewhere under this Agreement, each Party agrees to take Reasonable Steps (as defined below) (a) to receive and maintain the Confidential Information of the other Party in confidence, (b) not to disclose such Confidential Information to any third parties and (c) to promptly notify the disclosing Party upon learning of any law, rule, regulation or court order that purports to compel disclosure of any Confidential Information of the disclosing Party and to reasonably cooperate with the disclosing Party in the exercise of the disclosing Party's right to protect the confidentiality of such Confidential Information. Neither Party hereto shall use all or any part of the Confidential Information of the other Party for any purpose other than to perform its obligations under this Agreement. The Parties will take Reasonable Steps (as defined below) to ensure that their employees, representatives and agents comply with this provision. As used herein, \"Reasonable Steps\" means at least the same degree of care that the receiving Party uses to protect its own Confidential Information, and, in no event, no less than reasonable care.\n\n     13.2 EXCLUSIONS. Nothing contained herein shall prevent a Party from disclosing Confidential Information pursuant to any applicable law, rule, regulation or court order; provided, however, that such Party complies with the notice provisions of Section 13.1(c)  [CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS] to the\n\n                                    19    20\n\nextent permissible under applicable laws, rules, regulations or court orders. Such disclosure shall not alter the status of such information hereunder for all other purposes as Confidential Information.\n\n     13.3 TERMINATION. Upon termination of this Agreement, all Confidential Information shall be returned to the disclosing Party or destroyed unless otherwise specified or permitted elsewhere under this Agreement. The confidentiality obligations contained in this Article 13  [CONFIDENTIALITY] shall survive termination of this Agreement for a period of three years.\n\n     13.4 INJUNCTION. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Article 13  [CONFIDENTIALITY] are reasonable and necessary to protect the other Party's interests in its Confidential Information, that any breach of the provisions of this Article 13  [CONFIDENTIALITY] may result in irreparable harm to such other Party, and that the remedy at law for such breach may be inadequate. Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Article 13  [CONFIDENTIALITY] by a Party hereto, the other Party, in addition to any other relief available to it at law, in equity or otherwise, shall be entitled to seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief restraining the breaching Party from engaging in and/or continuing any conduct that would constitute a breach of this Article 13  [CONFIDENTIALITY], without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting a bond or other security.\n\n     13.5 PUBLICITY. Except as may be required by applicable laws, rules or regulations (including those arising under any securities laws), neither Party will originate any publicity, news release or other public announcement, written or oral, whether to the public press or otherwise, concerning the relationship between the Parties or the transactions described in this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event disclosure is required by applicable law, rules or regulations, then the Party required to so disclose such information shall, to the extent possible, provide to the other Party for its approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) a written copy of such public announcement at least five business days prior to disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party shall have the right to make a press release with respect to its entering into this Agreement; provided that such Party provides to the other Party a copy of the proposed press release no less than five business days prior to its proposed release and that the contents of such press release shall be subject to the other Party's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.\n\n14. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Each Party hereby represents, covenants and warrants to the other Party that:\n\n     14.1 It has the corporate power to enter into this Agreement and to grant the rights and licenses granted herein and otherwise perform this Agreement;\n\n     14.2 It is not a Party to any agreement or understanding and knows of no law or regulation that would prohibit it from entering into and performing this Agreement or that would conflict with this Agreement; and\n\n     14.3 When executed and delivered by it, this Agreement will constitute a legal, valid and binding obligation of it, enforceable against it in accordance with this Agreement's terms.\n\n                                    20    21\n\n15.

Administrative Support Services You agree to provide administrative support services, directly or through an affiliate/designee, to your customers who may from time to time own of record or beneficially a Fund's Shares. Services provided may include, but are not limited to, some or all of the following: (i) processing dividend and distribution payments from the Fund on behalf of customers; (ii) providing periodic statements to your customers showing their positions in the Shares or share equivalents; (iii) arranging for bank wires; (iv) responding to routine customer inquiries relating to services performed by you; (v) providing sub-accounting or sub-transfer agency services with respect to the Shares beneficially owned by your customers or the information necessary for sub-accounting or sub-transfer agency services; (vi) if required by law, forwarding shareholder communications from the Fund (such as proxies, shareholder reports, annual and semi-annual financial statements and dividend, distribution and tax notices) to your customers; (vii) forwarding to customers proxy statements and proxies containing any proposals regarding this Agreement or the Administrative Services Plan related hereto; (viii) aggregating and processing purchase, exchange, and redemption requests from customers and placing net purchase, exchange, and redemption orders for your customers; (ix) providing customers with a service that invests the assets of their accounts in the Shares pursuant to specific or preauthorized instructions; (x) establishing and maintaining customer accounts and records related to customer accounts and/or transactions in the Shares; (xi) assisting customers in changing dividend or distribution options, account designations and addresses; or (xii) other similar services if requested by the Funds. In providing administrative support services, you agree to follow any written guidelines or standards relating to the processing of purchase, exchange and redemption orders for your customers as we may provide to you including the provisions outlined in Appendix B. All purchase and redemption orders will be executed at net asset value, plus or minus any applicable sales charges, in accordance with the terms and conditions of a Fund's then current prospectus and Statement of Additional Information. You represent and warrant that your internal controls for accepting, processing and transmitting purchase, exchange and redemption orders are reasonably designed to ensure that you comply with Section 22(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \"1940 Act\") and Rule 22c-1 thereunder. 2. Office Space You will provide such office space and equipment, telephone facilities and personnel (which may be any part of the space, equipment and facilities currently used in your business, or any personnel employed by you) as may be reasonably necessary or beneficial in order to provide the aforementioned services to customers. March 2015\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Representations About the Funds and Shares Neither you nor any of your officers, employees or agents are authorized to make any representations concerning the Funds or their Shares except those contained in the then-current prospectuses or then-current Statements of Additional Information for such shares, copies of which will be supplied by the Fund's distributor (the \"Distributor\") to you, or in such supplemental literature or advertising as may be authorized by the Distributor in writing. 4. Independent Contractor and Limited Agency You will be deemed to be an independent contractor, and will have no authority to act as agent for either Nationwide or the Funds in any matter or in any respect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Nationwide, on behalf of each Fund, appoints you as each Fund's agent for the limited purpose of accepting orders for purchase, redemption and exchange of Shares, and receipt of such orders by you therefore shall constitute receipt by the applicable Fund of such orders for purposes of determining the price per Share at which such orders will be executed, in accordance with Rule 22c-1 under the 1940 Act. Except as specifically set forth herein, nothing in this Agreement will be deemed or construed to make you a partner, employee, representative or agent of Nationwide or any Fund or to create a partnership, joint venture, syndicate or association between you and us. 5. Indemnification By your written acceptance of this Agreement, you agree to and do release, indemnify and hold Nationwide and the Funds harmless from and against any and all direct or indirect liabilities or losses resulting from requests, directions, actions or inactions of or by you or your officers, employees or agents regarding your responsibilities hereunder or the purchase, redemption, transfer or registration of the Shares by or on behalf of customers. In turn, Nationwide, on behalf of the Funds, agrees to and does release, indemnify and hold you and your affiliates harmless from and against any and all direct or indirect liabilities or losses resulting from directions, actions or inactions of or by Nationwide, the Funds, or their respective officers, employees or agents regarding their responsibilities pursuant to this Agreement. 6. Compensation In consideration for the services and facilities provided by you hereunder, Nationwide (on behalf of the Funds) will pay to you, and you will accept as full payment therefore, a fee at the annual rate designated in Appendix A of the average daily net assets of a Fund's Shares owned of record or beneficially by your customers from time to time for which you provide administrative support services hereunder. Such fee will be computed daily and payable monthly by Nationwide within thirty (30) days of receipt from you of a valid invoice (in excel format) that identifies, for each CUSIP of each Fund, the number of sub-accounts, participants or beneficial shareholders serviced by you and such other information as may be necessary to validate the fee payable. The fee rate stated above may be prospectively increased or decreased by the Funds and/or Nationwide, in their sole discretion, at any time upon notice to you. Further, Nationwide or a Fund may, in its sole discretion and without notice, suspend or withdraw the sale of such Shares, including the sale of such Shares to you for the account of any customer(s). Nationwide, in its sole discretion, may arrange for the payment to you of the fees under this Agreement directly by the Funds rather than through Nationwide. Quarterly and Other Reports 2\n\n\n\n\n\nYou agree to provide all such information as is reasonably necessary for the Board of Trustees of the Trust to review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts of compensation received by you hereunder and the services provided for which you received such compensation. In addition, you will furnish Nationwide with such information as Nationwide or the Funds may reasonably request (including, without limitation, periodic certifications confirming the provision to customers of some or all of the services described herein), and will otherwise cooperate with Nationwide and the Funds (including, without limitation, any auditors designated by the Funds), in connection with the preparation of reports to the Trust's Board of Trustees concerning this Agreement and the monies paid or payable by Nationwide on behalf of the Funds pursuant hereto, as well as any other reports or filings that may be required by law. You agree, upon the reasonable request of Nationwide, to provide access during normal business hours to your facilities and records related to the services provided and the compensation payable hereunder, and to permit Nationwide to review the quality of such services provided and to respond to requests of the Trust's Board of Trustees. Nationwide agrees that all records obtained in connection with access to your facilities is your property and to maintain the confidentiality thereof. In particular, Nationwide agrees that no person having access to such records may use such records or information to solicit, directly or indirectly, any of your customers for any purpose. 7. Non-Exclusivity Both parties may enter into other similar Servicing Agreements with any other person or persons without the other's consent. 8. Representations and Warranties By your written acceptance of this Agreement, you represent, warrant and agree that: (i) all compensation payable to you hereunder is for administrative support services only; (ii) in no event will any of the compensation payable by Nationwide or the services provided by you hereunder be primarily intended to result in the sale of any Shares issued by a Fund; (iii) the compensation payable to you hereunder, together with any other compensation you receive from customers for services contemplated by this Agreement, will to the extent required be disclosed to your customers, and will not be excessive or unreasonable under the laws and instruments governing your relationships with your customers; and (iv) if you are subject to laws governing, among other things, the conduct of activities by federally chartered and supervised banks and other affiliated banking organizations, you will perform only those activities which are consistent with your statutory and regulatory obligations. 9. Termination This Agreement will become effective on the date a fully executed copy of this Agreement is received by Nationwide. This Agreement may be terminated as to the payments made on behalf of the Funds at any time, without the payment of any penalty, by the vote of a majority of the members of the Board of Trustees and who have no direct or indirect financial interest in the operation of the Administrative Services Plan or in any related agreements to the Administrative Services Plan (\"Disinterested Trustees\") or by a majority of the outstanding voting securities of a Fund, on at least sixty (60) days written notice to the parties to this Agreement. In addition, either you or Nationwide may terminate this Agreement (i) upon the material breach of this Agreement by the other or (ii) for any reason on at least ninety (90) days written notice to the other party. 3\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the event this Agreement is terminated as described herein, the indemnification provisions contained in this Agreement shall continue until the possibilities for damages or loss have expired. 10. Notices All notices and other communications to either you or Nationwide will be duly given if mailed, telegraphed, telexed or transmitted by similar telecommunications device to the address contained in the \"Acceptance of Agreement\" (Section 19) portion of this Agreement. 11. Choice of Law This Agreement will be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware and is assignable only upon the written consent by all the parties hereto. Amendments will be made only upon written consent by both parties. 12. Board Approval The Administrative Services Plan that relates to this Agreement has been approved by vote of a majority of (i) the Board of Trustees and (ii) the Disinterested Trustees, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval. 13. Trust Disclosure The term \"Nationwide Mutual Funds\" refers to the Trust created by, and the terms \"Board of Trustees\" and \"Trustees\" refer to the Trustees, as trustees but not individually or personally, acting from time to time under, the Amended and Restated Agreement and Declaration of Trust made and dated as of October 28, 2004, as has been or may be amended and/or restated from time to time (\"Agreement and Declaration of Trust\"), and to which reference is hereby made. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to require the Trust to take any action contrary to the Trust's Agreement and Declaration of Trust or By-Laws, or any applicable statutory or regulatory requirement to which the Trust is subject or by which the Trust is bound, or to relieve or deprive the Trust's Board of Trustees of the Board's responsibility for and control of the conduct of the affairs of the Trust. 14. Complete Agreement This Agreement supersedes and cancels any prior Servicing Agreement with respect to the Shares of a Fund listed in Exhibit A, and may be amended at any time and from time to time by written agreement of the parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Nationwide may amend or modify the Exhibits incorporated herein, as provided throughout this Agreement, by providing new exhibits to you. However, such amendment shall only become effective and part of this Agreement and be considered binding upon the first transaction placed by you following receipt of the new exhibits. 15. Privacy Program Each party to this Agreement agrees to protect Customer Information (defined below) and to comply as may be necessary with requirements of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the relevant state and federal regulations pursuant thereto, including Regulation S-P, and state privacy laws (all the foregoing referred to as \"Privacy Law\"). 4\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomer Information means any information contained on an application of a customer (\"Customer\") of a Fund or other form and all nonpublic personal information about a Customer that a party receives from the other party. Customer Information includes, by way of example and not limitation, name, address, telephone number, social security number, date of birth and personal financial information. The parties shall establish and maintain safeguards against the unauthorized access, destruction, loss or alteration of Customer Information in their control, which are no less rigorous than those maintained by a party for its own information of a similar nature. In the event of any improper disclosure of any Customer Information, the party responsible for the disclosure will immediately notify the other party. The Servicing Agent represents that it has implemented and maintains a comprehensive written information security program that contains appropriate security measures to safeguard Customer Information that the Servicing Agent receives, stores, maintains, processes or otherwise accesses in connection with the provision of services hereunder, including protecting such Customer Information against cyber attack. The provisions of this Privacy Program section shall survive the termination of the Agreement. 16. Anti-Money Laundering Program Nationwide and the Funds will rely upon you to establish a written Anti-Money Laundering Program (the \"Program\") to include policies, procedures, and controls that comply with the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (USA Patriot Act) of 2001, (\"the ACT\") and the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (\"BSA\"). Each party to this Agreement acknowledges, represents, and warrants that it has adopted and implemented an Anti-Money Laundering Program that complies and will continue to comply with all aspects and requirements of the ACT, the BSA, and all other applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Upon request, you shall promptly certify to having such Program that complies with and continues to comply with all aspects and requirements of the ACT, the BSA, and all other applicable federal, state and local anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Your Program shall include, and Nationwide and the Funds shall rely upon, your policies, procedures and controls to, among other things, (i) verify the identity (due diligence) of your customers, (ii) maintain records of the information used to identify your customers, (iii) determine if your customer appears on lists of known or suspected terrorists or associated with known or suspected terrorist organizations (said customer hereinafter referred to as a \"Prohibited Customer\"), and (iv) to ensure that Prohibited Customers and foreign shell banks do not maintain investments in any Fund. Your Program shall also comply with the Customer Identification Program (\"CIP\") for customers who open accounts on or after October 1, 2003, and as such, shall among other matters provide for the release of customer information to law enforcement agencies, and the filing of Suspicious Activity Reports (\"SARs\"), as and if applicable, and in accordance with the ACT.

Requests must set forth a specific period, not to exceed 12 months from the date of the request, for which transaction information is sought.

The Funds agree not to use the information received for marketing or any other similar purpose without your prior written consent. 18.2 Agreement to Restrict Trading. You agree to promptly and fully cooperate with any reasonable request made by the Fund to address market timing or excessive trading strategies identified by Nationwide in accordance with the applicable provisions of Rule 22c-2 and agree to restrict or prohibit further purchases or exchanges of Shares by a Shareholder that has been identified by such Fund as having engaged in transactions of the Fund's Shares (directly or indirectly through your account) that violate policies established by the Fund for the purpose of eliminating or reducing any dilution of the value of the outstanding Shares issued by the Fund. 18.2.1 Form of Instructions. Instructions must include the TIN, if known, and the specific restriction(s) to be executed. If the TIN is not known, the instructions must include an equivalent identifying number of the Shareholder(s) or account(s) or other agreed upon information to which the instruction relates. 18.2.2 Timing of Response. You agree to execute instructions as soon as reasonably practicable, but not later than five business days after your receipt of the instructions. 6\n\n\n\n\n\n18.2.3 Confirmation by You.

In the event of equipment failure or technical malfunctions or the parties' inability to otherwise perform transactions pursuant to the FUND/SERV Processing Procedures, or the parties' mutual consent to use manual processing, the Manual Processing Procedures below will apply. It is understood and agreed that, in the context of Section 22 of the 1940 Act and the rules and public interpretations thereunder by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC Staff), receipt by the Servicing Agent of any Instructions from the Client-shareholder prior to the Close of Trade on any Business Day shall be deemed to be receipt by the Funds of such Instructions solely for pricing purposes and shall cause purchases and sales to be deemed to occur at the Share Price for such Business Day, except as provided in 4(c) of the Manual Processing Procedures. Each Instruction shall be deemed to be accompanied by a representation by the Servicing Agent that it has received proper authorization from each Client-shareholder whose purchase, redemption, account transfer or exchange transaction is effected as a result of such Instruction. Fund/SERV-DCCS Processing Procedures 1. On each business day that the New York Stock Exchange (the \"Exchange\") is open for business on which the Funds determine their net asset values (\"Business Day\"), Nationwide shall accept, and effect changes in its records upon receipt of purchase, redemption, exchange, account transfer and registration instructions from the Servicing Agent electronically through Fund/SERV (\"Instructions\") without supporting documentation from the Client-shareholder. On each Business Day, Nationwide shall accept for processing any Instructions from the Servicing Agent and shall process such Instructions in a timely manner. 2. Nationwide shall perform any and all duties, functions, procedures and responsibilities assigned to it under this Agreement and as otherwise established by the NSCC. Nationwide shall conduct each of the foregoing activities in a competent manner and in compliance with (a) all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including NSCC Fund/SERV-DCCS rules and procedures relating to Fund/SERV; (b) the then-current Prospectus of a Fund; and (c) any provision relating to Fund/SERV in any other agreement of Nationwide that would affect its duties and obligations pursuant to this Agreement. 3. Confirmed trades and any other information provided by Nationwide to the Servicing Agent through Fund/SERV and pursuant to this Agreement shall be accurate, complete, and in the format prescribed by the NSCC. 4. Trade, registration, and broker/dealer information provided by the Servicing Agent to Nationwide through Fund/SERV and pursuant to this Agreement shall be accurate, complete and, in the\n\n\n\n\n\nformat prescribed by the NSCC. All Instructions by the Servicing Agent regarding each Fund/SERV Account shall be true and correct and will have been duly authorized by the registered holder. 5. For each Fund/SERV transaction, including transactions establishing a Client-shareholder account with Nationwide, the Servicing Agent shall provide the Funds and Nationwide with all information necessary or appropriate to establish and maintain each Fund/SERV transaction (and any subsequent changes to such information), which the Servicing Agent hereby certifies is and shall remain true and correct. The Servicing Agent shall maintain documents required by the Funds to effect Fund/SERV transactions. The Servicing Agent certifies that all Instructions delivered to Nationwide on any Business Day shall have been received by the Servicing Agent from the Client-shareholder by the close of trading (generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time (\"ET\")) on the Exchange (the \"Close of Trading\") on such Business Day and that any Instructions received by it after the Close of Trading on any given Business Day will be transmitted to Nationwide on the next Business Day. Manual Processing Procedures 1. On each Business Day, the Servicing Agent may receive Instructions from the Client-shareholder for the purchase or redemption of shares of the Funds based solely upon receipt of such Instructions prior to the Close of Trading on that Business Day. Instructions in good order received by the Servicing Agent prior to the close of trading on any given Business Day (generally, 4:00 p.m. ET (the \"Trade Date\") and transmitted to Nationwide by no later than 9:30 a.m. ET the Business Day following the Trade Date (\"Trade Date plus One\" or \"TD+1\"), will be executed at the NAV-based public offering price (\"Share Price\") of each applicable Fund, determined as of the Close of Trading on the Trade Date. 2. By no later than 6:00 p.m. ET on each Trade Date (\"Price Communication Time\"), Nationwide will use its best efforts to communicate to the Servicing Agent via electronic transmission acceptable to both parties, the Share Price of each applicable Fund, as well as dividend and capital gain information and, in the case of Funds that credit a daily dividend, the daily accrual for interest rate factor (mil rate), determined at the Close of Trading on that Trade Date. 3. As noted in Paragraph 1 above, by 9:30 a.m. ET on TD+1 (\"Instruction Cutoff Time\") and after the Servicing Agent has processed all approved transactions, the Servicing Agent will transmit to Nationwide via facsimile, telefax or electronic transmission or system-to-system, or by a method acceptable to the Servicing Agent and Nationwide, a report (the \"Instruction Report\") detailing the Instructions that were received by the Servicing Agent prior to the Funds' daily determination of Share Price for each Fund (i.e., the Close of Trading) on Trade Date. (a) It is understood by the parties that all Instructions from the Client-shareholder shall be received and processed by the Servicing Agent in accordance with its standard transaction processing procedures. The Servicing Agent or its designees shall maintain records sufficient to identify the date and time of receipt of all Client-shareholder transactions involving the Funds and shall make or cause to be made such records available upon reasonable request for examination by the Funds or its designated representative or, at the request of the Funds, by appropriate governmental authorities. Under no circumstances shall the Servicing Agent change, alter or modify any Instructions received by it in good order.\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Following the completion of the transmission of any Instructions by the Servicing Agent to Nationwide by the Instruction Cutoff Time, the Servicing Agent will verify that the Instruction was received by Nationwide and trades are pending by utilizing a remote terminal or such other method acceptable to Nationwide. (c) In the event that an Instruction transmitted by the Servicing Agent on any Business Day is not received by Nationwide by the Instruction Cutoff Time, due to mechanical difficulties or for any other reason beyond the Servicing Agent's reasonable control, such Instruction shall nonetheless be treated by Nationwide as if it had been received by the Instruction Cutoff Time, provided that the Servicing Agent retransmits such Instruction electronically (by facsimile transmission or other means mutually agreed upon) to Nationwide and such Instruction is received by Nationwide's (or the Distributor's) financial control representative no later than 9:30 a.m. ET on TD+1. In addition, the Servicing Agent will place a phone call to a financial control representative of Nationwide (or the Distributor) prior to 9:00 a.m. ET on TD+1 to advise Nationwide (or the Distributor) that a facsimile transmission concerning the Instruction is being sent. (d) With respect to all Instructions, Nationwide (or the Distributor's financial control representative) will manually adjust a Fund's records for the Trade Date to reflect any Instructions sent by the Servicing Agent. (e) By no later than 4:00 p.m. on TD+1, and based on the information transmitted to Nationwide (or the Distributor's financial control representative) pursuant to Paragraph 3(c) above, the Servicing Agent will use its best efforts to verify that all Instructions provided to Nationwide (or the Distributor's financial control representative) on TD+1 were accurately received and that the trades for each Account were accurately completed and the Servicing Agent will use its best efforts to notify Nationwide of any discrepancies. 4. As set forth below, upon the timely receipt from the Servicing Agent of the Instructions, the Fund will execute the purchase or redemption transactions (as the case may be) at the Share Price for each Fund computed as of the Close of Trading on the Trade Date. (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all purchase and redemption transactions will settle on TD+1. Settlements will be through net Federal Wire transfers to an account designated by a Fund. In the case of Instructions which constitute a net purchase order, the Servicing Agent shall, by 1:00 p.m. ET on TD+1, remit funds to the Fund's custodian in the amount necessary to cover such net purchase order. In the case of Instructions which constitute a net redemption order, Nationwide shall, by 1:00 p.m. ET on TD+1, remit funds to the Servicing Agent in the amount necessary to cover such net redemption order, provided that the Fund reserves the right to (i) delay settlement of redemptions for up to seven (7) Business Days after receiving a net redemption order in accordance with Section 22 of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder, or (iii) suspend redemptions pursuant to the 1940 Act or as otherwise required by law. Settlements shall be in U.S. dollars and a Fund may pay redemption proceeds in whole or in part by a distribution in-kind of readily marketable securities that it holds in lieu of cash in conformity with applicable law or regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) The Servicing Agent or such other party as may be designated, as record owner of each account (\"Record Owner\") will be provided with all written confirmations required under federal and state securities laws. (c) On any Business Day when the Federal Reserve Wire Transfer System is closed, all communication and processing rules will be suspended for the settlement of Instructions. Instructions will be settled on the next Business Day on which the Federal Reserve Wire Transfer System is open. The original TD+1 Settlement Date will not apply. Rather, for purposes of this Paragraph 4(c) only, the Settlement Date will be the date on which the Instruction settles. (d) The Servicing Agent shall, upon receipt of any confirmation or statement concerning the accounts, promptly verify by use of the terminal or by such other method acceptable to Nationwide and the Servicing Agent the accuracy of the information contained therein against the information contained in the Servicing Agent's internal record-keeping system and shall promptly, but in no event not more than seven days, advise Nationwide in writing of any discrepancies between such information. Nationwide and the Servicing Agent shall cooperate to resolve any such discrepancies as soon as reasonably practicable. Indemnification In the event of any error or delay with respect to both the Fund/SERV Processing Procedures and the Manual Processing Procedures outlined in Exhibit B herein: (i) which is caused by the Funds or Nationwide, Nationwide shall make any adjustments on the Funds' accounting system necessary to correct such error or delay and the responsible party or parties shall reimburse the Client-shareholder and the Servicing Agent, as appropriate, for any losses or reasonable costs incurred directly as a result of the error or delay but specifically excluding any and all consequential punitive or other indirect damages or (ii) which is caused by the Servicing Agent or by any Client-shareholder, Nationwide shall make any adjustment on the Funds' accounting system necessary to correct such error or delay and the affected party or parties shall be reimbursed by the Servicing Agent for any losses or reasonable costs incurred directly as a result of the error or delay, but specifically excluding any and all consequential punitive or other indirect damages. In the event of any such adjustments on the Funds' accounting system, the Servicing Agent shall make the corresponding adjustments on its internal record-keeping system. In the event that errors or delays with respect to the Procedures are contributed to by more than one party hereto, each party shall be responsible for that portion of the loss or reasonable cost which results from its error or delay. All parties agree to provide the other parties prompt notice of any errors or delays of the type referred to herein and to use reasonable efforts to take such action as may be appropriate to avoid or mitigate any such costs or losses."}]}, {"title": "VIOLINMEMORYINC_12_12_2012-EX-10.14-SPONSORSHIP AGREEMENT", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "SPONSORSHIP AGREEMENT", "answer_start": 188}], "id": "VIOLINMEMORYINC_12_12_2012-EX-10.14-SPONSORSHIP AGREEMENT__Document Name", "question": "The name of the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "Forty Niners SC", "answer_start": 313}, {"text": "For purposes of this Agreement, Forty Niners SC and Sponsor may each be referred to individually as a \"Party\" and may be collectively referred to as the \"Parties.\"", "answer_start": 644}, {"text": "Sponsor", "answer_start": 549}, {"text": "Forty Niners SC Stadium Company LLC", "answer_start": 313}, {"text": "Violin Memory, Inc.", "answer_start": 503}], "id": "VIOLINMEMORYINC_12_12_2012-EX-10.14-SPONSORSHIP AGREEMENT__Parties", "question": "The two or more parties who signed the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "June 13, 2012", "answer_start": 260}], "id": "VIOLINMEMORYINC_12_12_2012-EX-10.14-SPONSORSHIP AGREEMENT__Agreement Date", "question": "The date of the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "June 13, 2012", "answer_start": 260}], "id": "VIOLINMEMORYINC_12_12_2012-EX-10.14-SPONSORSHIP AGREEMENT__Effective Date", "question": "The date when the contract is effective\u00a0", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "This Agreement shall commence on the \"Effective Date\" and shall continue for ten (10) Contract Years, unless terminated in accordance with the provisions of Section 6 of this Agreement or extended by renewal by written agreement of the Parties in accordance with the provisions of Section 13(o) of this Agreement (the \"Term\").", "answer_start": 4633}], "id": "VIOLINMEMORYINC_12_12_2012-EX-10.14-SPONSORSHIP AGREEMENT__Expiration Date", "question": "On what date will the contract's initial term expire?", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [], "id": "VIOLINMEMORYINC_12_12_2012-EX-10.14-SPONSORSHIP AGREEMENT__Renewal Term", "question": "What is the renewal term after the initial term expires?

Distributor shall keep, and require its Affiliate and Sub-distributors to keep, complete, fair and true books of accounts and records for the purpose of (a) determining the amounts payable to Zogenix pursuant to this Agreement and the Supply Agreement and (b) ensuring that Distributor and its Affiliates and Sub-distributors do not otherwise cause any Zogenix Indemnitees to be in violation of the FCPA or other Applicable Laws. Such books and records shall be kept for such period of time required by Applicable Laws, but no less than three (3) years following the end of the Fiscal Year to which they pertain. Such records shall be subject to inspection in accordance with Section 7.5.\n\n7.5 Audits. Upon reasonable prior written notice, Distributor shall permit an independent, certified public accountant selected by Zogenix and reasonably acceptable to Distributor, which acceptance will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, to audit or inspect those books or records of Distributor and its Affiliates and Sub-distributors that relate to Net Sales for the sole purpose of verifying: (a) the payments due hereunder and payments due under the Supply Agreement; (b) the withholding taxes, if any, required by Applicable Laws to be withheld; and (c) Distributor's compliance with Sections 10.1 and 10.2. Such accountant will disclose to Zogenix only the amount and accuracy of payments reported and actually paid or otherwise payable under this Agreement or the Supply Agreement, and will send a copy of the report to Distributor at the same time it is sent to Zogenix. Prompt adjustments (including\n\n28\n\nUS-DOCS\\105216871.19\n\nSource: ZOGENIX, INC., 10-Q, 5/9/2019\n\n\n\n\n\ninterest under Section 7.6 for underpaid amounts) shall be made by the Parties to reflect the results of such audit. Such inspections may be made no more than once each Fiscal Year (unless an audit or inspection reveals a material inaccuracy in reports made under this Agreement, in which case it may be repeated within such Fiscal Year), and during normal business hours, with reasonable efforts to minimize disruption of Distributor's normal business activities. Inspections conducted under this Section 7.5 shall be at the expense of Zogenix, unless a variation or error producing an underpayment in amounts payable exceeding [***] of the amount paid for a period covered by the inspection is established, in which case all reasonable costs relating to the inspection for such period shall be paid by Distributor. Absent manifest error, the accountant's report will be final and binding on the Parties.\n\n7.6 Late Payments. In the event that any payment due under this Agreement or the Supply Agreement is not made when due, the payment shall accrue interest from the date due at a rate per annum equal to [***] above the U.S. Prime Rate (as set forth in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern U.S. Edition) for the date on which payment was due, calculated daily on the basis of a 365-day year, or similar reputable data source; provided that in no event shall such rate exceed the maximum legal annual interest rate. The payment of such interest shall not limit a Party from exercising any other rights it may have as a consequence of the lateness of any payment.\n\nARTICLE 8. CONFIDENTIALITY\n\n8.1 Confidential Information. Except to the extent expressly authorized by this Agreement or otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties, the Parties agree that during the Term and for [***] thereafter, the receiving Party (the \"Receiving Party\") shall keep confidential and shall not publish or otherwise disclose or use for any purpose other than as provided for in this Agreement or the Supply Agreement any Information or materials furnished to it or its Affiliates by or on behalf of the other Party (the \"Disclosing Party\") or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement, the Supply Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement or any other written agreement between the Parties or their Affiliates, in any form (written, oral, photographic, electronic, magnetic, or otherwise), including all information concerning the Product and any other technical or business information of whatever nature (collectively, \"Confidential Information\" of the Disclosing Party). All Zogenix Technology (including, without limitation, all Product Inventions and Data) shall be deemed the Confidential Information of Zogenix. Distributor Inventions shall be deemed the Confidential Information of Distributor. Joint Inventions shall be deemed the Confidential Information of each of Zogenix and Distributor. Each Party may use the Confidential Information of the other Party only to the extent required to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement or the Supply Agreement (including to exercise its rights or fulfill its obligations under this Agreement or the Supply Agreement). Each Party will use at least the same standard of care as it uses to protect proprietary or confidential information of its own (but in no event less than reasonable care) to ensure that its employees, agents, consultants and other representatives do not disclose or make any unauthorized use of the\n\n29\n\nUS-DOCS\\105216871.19\n\nSource: ZOGENIX, INC., 10-Q, 5/9/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidential Information of the other Party.

In any event, the Parties agree to take all reasonable action to avoid disclosure of Confidential Information hereunder.\n\n8.4 Confidentiality of this Agreement and its Terms. Except as otherwise provided in this Article 8, each Party agrees not to disclose to any Third Party the existence of this Agreement or the terms of this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, except that each Party may disclose the terms of this Agreement that are not otherwise made public as contemplated by Section 8.5 as permitted under Section 8.3.\n\n8.5 Public Announcements.\n\n(a) As soon as practicable following the Effective Date, the Parties may each issue a press release in English and/or Japanese, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 8.5(a), announcing the existence of this Agreement. Except as required by Applicable Laws (including disclosure requirements of the SEC or any stock exchange on which securities issued by a Party or its Affiliates are traded), neither Party shall make any other public announcement concerning this Agreement or the subject matter hereof without the prior written consent of the other, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that each Party may make any public statement in response to questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst calls, or issue press releases, so long as any such public statement or press release is not inconsistent with prior public disclosures or public statements approved by the other Party pursuant to this Section 8.5 and does not reveal non\u2011public information about the other Party; and provided further that Zogenix may make public statements regarding the results of Development and Commercialization activities in the Territory. In the event of a public announcement required by Applicable Laws, to the extent practicable under the circumstances, the Party making such announcement shall provide the other Party with a copy of the proposed text of such announcement sufficiently in advance of the scheduled release to afford such other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the proposed text.\n\n(b) The Parties will coordinate in advance with each other in connection with the filing of this Agreement (including redaction of certain provisions of this Agreement) with the SEC or any stock exchange on which securities issued by a Party or its Affiliate are traded, and each Party will use reasonable efforts to seek confidential treatment for the terms proposed to be redacted; provided that each Party will ultimately retain control over what information to disclose to the SEC or other applicable government body, and provided further that the Parties will use their reasonable efforts to file redacted versions with any governing bodies which are consistent with redacted versions previously filed with any other governing bodies. Other than\n\n31\n\nUS-DOCS\\105216871.19\n\nSource: ZOGENIX, INC., 10-Q, 5/9/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nsuch obligation, neither Party (nor its Affiliates) will be obligated to consult with or obtain approval from the other Party with respect to any filings to the SEC or any other government body governing a stock exchange.\n\n(c) Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement or as required by Applicable Laws, neither Party may use the other Party's trademarks, service marks or trade names, or otherwise refer to or identify that other Party in marketing or promotional materials, press releases, statements to news media or other public announcements, without the other Party's prior written consent, which that other Party may grant or withhold in its sole discretion.\n\n8.6 Publication. At least [***] prior to Distributor or its Affiliates or Sub-distributors publishing, publicly presenting, and/or submitting for written or oral publication a manuscript, presentation, abstract, marketing document or the like that includes Information relating to the Product that has not been previously published, Distributor shall provide to Zogenix's Alliance Manager a draft copy thereof for Zogenix's review (unless Distributor is required by Applicable Laws to publish such Information sooner, in which case Distributor shall provide such draft copy to Zogenix's Alliance Manager as much in advance of such publication as possible). Distributor shall consider in good faith any comments provided by Zogenix during such [***] period, and in the event that Zogenix raises any concerns the matter shall be raised at the JSC; provided that Distributor shall, at Zogenix's reasonable request, cease such proposed publication or remove therefrom any information requested by Zogenix. The contribution of each Party shall be noted in all publications or presentations by acknowledgment or co-authorship, whichever is appropriate.\n\n8.7 Prior Non-Disclosure Agreements. As of the Effective Date, the terms of this Article 8 shall supersede any prior non-disclosure, secrecy or confidentiality agreement between the Parties (or their Affiliates) dealing with the subject of this Agreement, including the Confidentiality Agreement, but excluding any terms of the Supply Agreement. Any information disclosed under such prior agreements shall be deemed disclosed under this Agreement.\n\n8.8 Equitable Relief. Given the nature and value of the Confidential Information and the competitive damage and irreparable harm that would result to a Party upon unauthorized disclosure, use or transfer of its Confidential Information to any Third Party, the Parties agree that monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Article 8. If the Receiving Party becomes aware of any breach or threatened breach of this Article 8 by the Receiving Party or a Third Party to whom the Receiving Party disclosed the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, the Receiving Party promptly shall notify the Disclosing Party and cooperate with the Disclosing Party to regain possession of its Confidential Information and prevent any further breach. In addition to all other remedies, a Party shall be entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive and other equitable relief as a remedy for any breach or threatened breach of this Article 8 without furnishing proof of actual damages or posting a bond.\n\nARTICLE 9.\n\n32\n\nUS-DOCS\\105216871.19\n\nSource: ZOGENIX, INC., 10-Q, 5/9/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNERSHIP AND ENFORCEMENT\n\n9.1 Ownership of Intellectual Property.\n\n(a) Zogenix Technology.

Each Party shall share with the other Party all information available to it regarding such alleged or threatened infringement by a Third Party. Zogenix shall have the sole right, but not the obligation, to bring and control any action or proceeding with respect to alleged or threatened infringement by a Third Party in the Territory of any Zogenix Patent at Zogenix's cost and expense. If Zogenix elects to commence a suit to enforce the applicable Zogenix Patent against such infringements, then Distributor shall have the right to join such enforcement action, if permitted by Applicable Law, upon notice to Zogenix and be represented by a counsel of its own choice at its own cost and expense.

The Parties then shall discuss the matter and seek in good faith to agree on whether the Parties should take a license under such Patent, and if so, on what terms; provided, that if the Parties are unable to agree after a reasonable period, [***], of good faith discussions, then Zogenix shall have the right to obtain such a license on such terms as it determines in its sole discretion and at its own cost and expense. Provided, however, in the event that Zogenix elects not to seek or fails to obtain a license under such Patent, Distributor shall have the right to obtain such a license with prior written notice to Zogenix.\n\n(b) Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing of any allegation by a Third Party that the activity of either Party pursuant to this Agreement or the Supply Agreement infringes or may infringe the intellectual property rights of such Third Party.

For all breaches of this Agreement, the allegedly breaching Party shall have [***] from the receipt of the initial notice to cure such breach. If the Party receiving notice of breach fails to cure the breach within such [***] period, then the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement in its entirety effective on written notice of termination to the other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) if such material breach (other than a payment breach), by its nature, is curable, but is not reasonably curable within the [***] period, then such period shall be extended if the breaching Party provides a written plan for curing such breach to the non-breaching Party and uses Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cure such breach in accordance with such written plan; provided, that no such extension shall exceed [***] without the consent of the non-breaching Party.\n\n(e) Diligence.

In the event that prior to launch of the Product in the Field in the Territory (i) either Party has a good faith concern that the launch of the Product in the Field in the Territory is not likely to be possible with Commercially Reasonable Efforts, based upon credible evidence, such as any decision by a Regulatory Authority to require significant additional information before granting or as a condition to granting Regulatory Approval, or (ii) Distributor has a good faith concern that the Commercialization of the Product in the Territory will not be commercially viable, such Party may raise such concern for discussion by the JSC. If, within the time periods set forth in Section 3.1(d) or such longer time period as the Parties may mutually agree upon in writing, neither the JSC nor the Executives agree whether to launch or commercialize Product in the Territory, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 3.1(d) or Article 13, either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon at least [***] written notice to the other Party.\n\n(h) Third Party Patent.\n\n(i) Distributor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Zogenix if (A) the Parties have discussed an issued Patent under Section 9.4(a), (B) either (1) both Zogenix and Distributor agree not to seek a license under such issued Patent or (2) the applicable Party as determined pursuant to Section 9.4(a) failed to obtain a license under such issued Patent, after good faith efforts to do so, within [***] after the Parties' agreement as to which Party would seek such license, and (C) Distributor reasonably and in good faith believes that the sale, offer for sale or import of the Product in the Territory in the Field infringes such issued Patent in the Territory, such that Distributor is not able to sell the Product in\n\n43\n\nUS-DOCS\\105216871.19\n\nSource: ZOGENIX, INC., 10-Q, 5/9/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nthe Territory in the Field without infringing such issued Patent.\n\n(ii) Zogenix shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Distributor if (A) the Parties have discussed an issued Patent under Section 9.4(a), (B) either (1) both Zogenix and Distributor agree not to seek a license under such issued Patent or (2) the applicable Party as determined pursuant to Section 9.4(a) failed to obtain a license under such issued Patent, after good faith efforts to do so, within [***] after the Parties' agreement as to which Party would seek such license, and (C) Zogenix reasonably and in good faith believes that the manufacture for and sale to Distributor of the Product infringes such issued Patent, such that Zogenix will not be able to conduct (or have conducted on its behalf) such manufacturing for and sale of the Product to Distributor without infringing (or its contract manufacturers infringing) such issued Patent.\n\n(i) Change of Control. This Agreement may be terminated by either Party upon [***] written notice to the other Party in the event that the other Party undergoes a Change of Control; provided, however, that such termination notice shall only be effective if delivered within [***] after the later of the occurrence of such Change of Control or the date the Party undergoing the Change of Control delivers written notice thereof to the other Party.\n\n(j) Other Zogenix Termination Rights.

Following the execution of the Supply Agreement pursuant to Section 5.2, the Parties agree that this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon termination of the Supply Agreement for any reason.\n\n(l) Distributor Safety Concern. This Agreement may be terminated by Distributor upon written notice to Zogenix, in the event that Distributor has a reasonable belief after due inquiry that the promotion of the Product in the Field in the Territory presents a substantial risk of harm or injury to consumers which risk is unacceptable according to established principles of medical ethics. Prior to terminating this Agreement in accordance with this Section 12.2(l), Distributor shall present evidence supporting the basis for such termination to Zogenix and shall consider in good faith all comments provided by Zogenix prior to terminating this Agreement.\n\n44\n\nUS-DOCS\\105216871.19\n\nSource: ZOGENIX, INC., 10-Q, 5/9/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n12.3 Rights on Termination.

The affected Party shall notify the other Party of such force majeure circumstances as soon as reasonably practicable, and shall promptly undertake all reasonable efforts necessary to cure such force majeure circumstances. Such excuse from liability shall be effective only to the extent and duration of the event(s) causing the failure or delay in performance and provided that the Party has not caused such event(s) to occur.\n\n14.3 Assignment. Except as expressly provided in this Section 14.3, neither this Agreement nor any rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned or otherwise transferred by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that either Party may assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder without the other Party's consent:\n\n(a) in connection with the transfer or sale of all or substantially all of the business of the assigning Party to a Third Party, whether by merger, sale of stock, sale of assets or otherwise; provided that in the event of a transaction (whether this Agreement is actually assigned or is assumed by the acquiring party by operation of law (e.g., in the context of a reverse triangular merger)), unless otherwise agreed with the acquiring party in writing, intellectual property of the acquiring party shall not be included in the intellectual property to which the other Party has access under this Agreement; or\n\n(b) to an Affiliate, provided that the assigning Party shall remain liable and responsible to the non\u2011assigning Party hereto for the performance and observance of all such duties and obligations by such Affiliate.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, in the event that either Party assigns this Agreement pursuant to this Section 14.3(a), the other Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.2(i). This Agreement shall be binding upon successors and permitted assigns of the Parties. Any assignment not in accordance with this Section 14.3 will be null and void.\n\n14.4 Severability.

The Party requesting such relief shall simultaneously file a demand for arbitration of the dispute, and shall request that the AAA proceed under its rules for an expedited hearing.\n\n    8.4.  Costs. Unless the arbitrator, if any, determines otherwise, each Party will bear its own attorneys' fees and other costs associated with the negotiation and arbitration provided for by this Article 8, except that costs and expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally. If court proceedings to stay litigation or compel arbitration are necessary, the Party who unsuccessfully initiates or opposes such proceedings will pay all associated costs, expenses and attorneys' fees that are reasonably incurred by the other Party.  To the extent that any claim in arbitration relates to the collection of amounts owed under Article 6, the Party entitled to collect such amounts shall be entitled to recover all reasonable costs of collection, including expenses and attorneys' fees that are reasonably incurred.\n\n    8.5.  Two Year Limitation.  Except for claims under Sections 11.4  [Indemnification by LeadersOnline] and 11.5  [Indemnification by VerticalNet] hereof, neither Party may bring a claim or action regardless of form, arising out of or related to\n\n                                       9\n\nthis Agreement, including any claim of fraud or misrepresentation, more than two years after the cause of action accrues or becomes known, whichever is later.\n\n    8.6.  Confidentiality.  In order to facilitate the resolution of controversies or claims between the Parties with respect to each Party hereto, such controversies or claims, including details regarding negotiations, arbitration and settlement terms, shall be treated as Confidential Information of the other Party hereto in accordance with Article 9.\n\n    8.7.  Remedial Measures. In the event of (a) any material remediable breach of this Agreement by the other Party which remains uncured 30 days after notice of such breach (other than a breach of a payment obligation) was received by the other Party or (b) any material breach which cannot be cured, the non-breaching Party may take reasonable remediable measures upon prior written notice and at the cost and expense of the breaching Party without prejudice and in addition to any other rights arising from such breach.  In addition, the non-breaching Party shall take reasonable steps to mitigate damages arising out of such breach.\n\nSource: LEADERSONLINE INC, S-1/A, 4/27/2000\n\n\n\n\n\n9.   CONFIDENTIALITY\n\n    9.1.  Confidentiality Obligations.  Except as permitted elsewhere under this Agreement, each Party agrees to take Reasonable Steps (as defined below) (a) to receive and maintain the Confidential Information of the other Party in confidence and (b) not to disclose such Confidential Information to any third parties, provided, the receiving Party may disclose such Confidential Information to its employees, representatives and agents who have a need to know such information for purposes of carrying out the terms of this Agreement. Neither Party hereto shall use all or any part of the Confidential Information of the other Party for any purpose other than to perform its obligations under this Agreement.  The Parties will take Reasonable Steps (as defined below) to ensure that their employees, representatives and agents comply with this provision.  As used herein, \"Reasonable Steps\" means at least the same degree of care that the receiving Party uses to protect its own Confidential Information, and, in any event, no less than reasonable care.\n\n    9.2.  Exclusions.  \"Confidential Information\" does not include information that (a) is or becomes publicly available through no fault of the receiving Party; (b) was already known to the receiving Party at the time it was disclosed to the receiving Party, as evidenced by records of the receiving Party; (c) is independently developed by employees of the receiving Party who had no knowledge of or access to such information, as evidenced by records of the receiving Party; (d) is received from a third party who is under no obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing Party; or (e) must be disclosed pursuant to applicable laws, rules or regulations; provided, however, that the receiving Party first gives the disclosing Party notice and a reasonable opportunity to secure confidential protection of such Confidential Information.\n\n    9.3.  Termination.  Subject to Section 12.12  [Survival], upon termination of this Agreement, all Confidential Information shall be returned to the disclosing Party or, at the request of the disclosing Party, destroyed unless otherwise specified or permitted elsewhere under this Agreement.  The confidentiality obligations contained in this Article 9 shall survive termination of this Agreement for a period of three (3) years.\n\n                                       10\n\n    9.4.  Injunction.  Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Article 9 are reasonable and necessary to protect the other Party's interests in its Confidential Information, that any breach of the provisions of this Article 9 may result in irreparable harm to such other Party, and that the remedy at law for such breach may be inadequate.  Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Article 9 by a Party hereto, the other Party, in addition to any other relief available to it at law, in equity or otherwise, shall be entitled to seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief restraining the breaching Party from engaging in and/or continuing any conduct that would constitute a breach of this Article 9, without posting a bond or other security.\n\n    9.5.  Publicity. Except as may be required by law in which case a party will provide as much advance notice as reasonably possible, neither Party will originate any press release concerning the relationship between the Parties or the transactions described in this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Date, VerticalNet and LeadersOnline shall jointly issue a press release with respect to entering into this Agreement.\n\n    9.6.  User Data. LeadersOnline shall provide VerticalNet with User Data on each User that enters the LeadersOnline Site through a Link from a VerticalNet Site and submits information through the LeadersOnline Site by sending an email with such information to an email address designated by VerticalNet at the time the request occurs.  User Data shall be maintained by each Party as Confidential Information of the other Party during the Term and 5 years thereafter, provided such User Data may be disclosed only as part of an aggregation or analysis of all User Data but not as independent data.  Upon termination of the Agreement, VerticalNet and LeadersOnline shall jointly own all User Data. Neither Party shall use the User Data other than in accordance with the VerticalNet privacy policy and all applicable laws during the Term and thereafter.\n\n10.

This First Amendment will be effective as of July 5, 2011, upon the signature of both Cargill and BioAmber.\n\nCargill and Bioamber mutually agree as follows:\n\n\n\nThe Parties, through their authorized representatives, hereby agree to the terms and conditions of this First Amendment.\n\n   Cargill Confidential   * Confidential treatment requested\n\n1. Section 2.2 of the Development Agreement is hereby amended to allow Cargill at its sole discretion to apply [***] during the period of July 5,  2011, through September 30, 2011, to perform the Work Plan in addition to the [***] specified in the unamended Section 2.2. The terms for  compensation and expenses for these additional FTEs will be as provided for the original FTEs in Section 2.2.\n\n2. Other than as expressly modified by this First Amendment, all terms and conditions of the Development Agreement continue without  modification.\n\nCARGILL, INCORPORATED  Bio Technology Development Center     BIOAMBER S.A.S.\n\n/s/ Jack Staboch       /s/ Jim Millis Signature     Signature VP BioTDC     CTO Title     Title 7/14/11     7/18/11\n\n\n\n\n\nAMENDMENTS TO COMMERCIAL LICENSE AGREEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT   AGREEMENT\n\nWHEREAS, Cargill, Incorporated (\"Cargill\") and BioAmber S.A.S. (\"Bioamber\") entered into a Development Agreement having an Effective  Date of April 15 , 2010, as amended on July 5 , 2011 (the \"Development Agreement\");\n\nWHEREAS, Cargill and Bioamber entered into a Commercial License Agreement having an Effective Date of April 15, 2010 (the \"Commercial  License\");\n\nWHEREAS, Bioamber now desires to amend the Development Agreement to allow Bioamber to fund a research project being conducted by  the Biotechnology Research Institute (\"BRI\"), which involves the molecular re-engineering of a Methylotroph owned by BRI and the development  of a lab scale fermentation design for using the re-engineered Methylotroph to make succinic acid or salts thereof from a methanol feedstock (the  \"BRI Project\"). The BRI Project will be co-funded by funds available from the Canadian National Research Council;\n\nWHEREAS, Bioamber further desires to scale-up the production of succinic acid using a Corynebacteria biocatalyst (MCC-17) available from  Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (\"MCC\") and to possibly produce succinic acid or salts using MCC-17 as an alternative to the E. coli BioAmber  has licensed from the DOE at: (1) Bioamber's existing demonstration-scale succinic acid production facility located at Pomacle, France; and (2) a  succinic acid production facility located at Sarnia, Ontario Canada having a maximum production capacity of 35,000 metric tons of succinic acid per  year (the \"Sarnia Plant\"). Together these scale-up projects will be referred to as the \"Scale-up and Production Project\";\n\nWHEREAS, Cargill is willing to allow Bioamber to fund the BRI Project and to conduct the Scale-up and Production Project, subject to the  following terms and conditions. Now therefore the Parties agree:\n\nAmendment To the Development Agreement\n\nA. Section 13.9 of the Development Agreement is amended to add the following at the end of the Section:   \"Notwithstanding the above, Bioamber may fund the BRI Project up until the Methylotroph (or re-engineered Methylotroph) demonstrates  the ability to produce succinic acid (or salts thereof) from any feedstock at a concentration of [***] grams/liter succinic acid (or salts thereof).  Within thirty (30) days of the Methylotroph (or re-engineered Methylotroph) demonstrating such production levels of succinic acid, Bioamber will  cease any further funding and/or other support for the BRI Project. Further Bioamber will require that any unexpended funds received from  Bioamber be utilized for a project other than the BRI Project.   B. New Section 13.10 is added to the Development Agreement as set forth below:   \"13.10 Notwithstanding the provisions of section 13.9, Bioamber may conduct the Scale-up and Production Project, subject to Bioamber hereby  agreeing to convert the demonstration-scale Pomacle France succinic acid production facility and the Sarnia Plant to solely utilize CB1 as the  biocatalyst for the production of succinic acid (and/or salts thereof). This conversion will be carried out according to the provisions of Section 5.9  of the Commercial License, it being understood that all economic obligations of item (iv) above will be relative to the E. coli strain technology, not  the Mitsubishi strain technology. In order to enable such conversion, Bioamber will put in place agreements with the owners/operators of the  Sarnia Plant that will enable Bioamber to require such conversion of the Sarnia Plant to solely use CB1 for the manufacture of succinic acid as  described above.\"\n\nAmendment To the Commercial License\n\nA. Section 5.9 of the Commercial License is amended to add the following at the end of the Section:\n\n\"Bioamber shall use best efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for the use of the CB1 Strain in all countries where Bioamber and/or a Bioamber  licensee are using any strain other than the CB1 strain for the production of succinic acid and/or salts thereof. Additionally, Bioamber shall use  best efforts to scale up the CB1 Strain and fermentation protocols utilizing the CB1 Strain.\"\n\nNothing in these amendments will reduce Bioamber's obligations to replace MCC-17 and Bioamber's current E. coli strain with CB1 in all the  existing and future succinic acid production facilities of Bioamber and Bioamber licensees, according to the provisions of Section 5.9 of the  Commercial License.      * Confidential treatment requested\n\nth th\n\n\n\n\n\n   * Confidential treatment requested\n\nCARGILL, INCORPORATED\n\nBy:    /s/ Pirkko Suominen\n\n\n\nName: Pirkko Suominen Title: Director, Bio Technology Development  Center, Minneapolis Date:   10/19/2011\n\nBIOAMBER, SAS\n\nBy:    /s/ Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Huc\n\n\n\nName: Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Huc Title: President Date:   October 15, 2011"}]}, {"title": "XACCT Technologies, Inc.SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Support and Maintenance Agreement", "answer_start": 107}], "id": "XACCT Technologies, Inc.SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT__Document Name", "question": "The name of the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "XACCT Technologies, Inc.", "answer_start": 268}, {"text": "_______________________________", "answer_start": 433}, {"text": "Licensee", "answer_start": 498}, {"text": "XACCT", "answer_start": 268}], "id": "XACCT Technologies, Inc.SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT__Parties", "question": "The two or more parties who signed the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "the ____ day of _______________2000", "answer_start": 194}], "id": "XACCT Technologies, Inc.SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT__Agreement Date", "question": "The date of the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "the ____ day of _______________2000", "answer_start": 194}], "id": "XACCT Technologies, Inc.SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT__Effective Date", "question": "The date when the contract is effective\u00a0", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "The initial term of this Agreement is one (1) year from the date of          delivery of the Product to Licensee unless earlier terminated in          accordance with this Agreement.", "answer_start": 8979}], "id": "XACCT Technologies, Inc.SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT__Expiration Date", "question": "On what date will the contract's initial term expire?", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "The Agreement will be automatically          renewed for additional one (1) year terms (subject to applicable fee          adjustments) unless thirty (30) days prior to the anniversary of the          Effective Date Licensee gives written notice to XACCT of its intention          not to renew.", "answer_start": 9162}], "id": "XACCT Technologies, Inc.SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT__Renewal Term", "question": "What is the renewal term after the initial term expires?

Each party acknowledges that the other has and          will have substantial goodwill in its Trademarks used in conjunction          with this Agreement, and agrees it shall not do anything that could          injure, diminish or depreciate the value of the goodwill associated          with the Trademarks or business of the other. All goodwill associated          with the use of each party's Trademarks shall enure exclusively to the          owner of such Trademarks.\n\n6.4      CONDUCT OF BUSINESS.

Each party represents and warrants to the other party that          it is under no current obligation or restriction, nor will it knowingly          assume any such obligation or restriction that does or would in any way          interfere or conflict with, or that does or would present a conflict of          interest concerning the performance to be rendered hereunder or the          rights and licenses granted herein.\n\n7.2      INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WARRANTY.

Changepoint warrants that the Software will perform          in substantial accordance with the Documentation, and the media on          which the Software is distributed will be free from defects in          materials and workmanship under normal use, for a period of one hundred          twenty (120) days after delivery of the Software to Corio for          Acceptance Testing (the \"Warranty Period\"). In addition, Changepoint          warrants that during the Warranty Period the Software is free of any          willfully introduced computer virus, or any other similar harmful,          malicious or hidden program or data, which is designed to disable,          erase, or alter the Software, or any other files, data, or software.          If, during the Warranty Period, the Software does not perform in          substantial compliance with the Documentation, Changepoint shall take          all commercially reasonable efforts to correct the Software, or if          correction of the Software is reasonably not possible, at Changepoint's          option, replace such Software free of charge. Changepoint will replace          any defective media returned to Changepoint during the Warranty Period.          In the event any such breach of warranty can not be reasonably          corrected at Changepoint's sole expense, Corio has the right to\n\n\n\n\n\n         terminate this Agreement and receive a\n\n                                       11\n\n         refund of all prepaid fees, if any. The foregoing are Corio's sole          and exclusive remedies for breach of the foregoing product warranty.          The warranty set forth above is made to and for the benefit of Corio          only. This product warranty shall not apply if:\n\n         (a)      the Software has been not properly installed and used at all                   times and in accordance with the Documentation; and\n\n         (b)      Corio has requested modifications, alterations or additions to                   the Software that cause it to deviate from the Documentation.\n\n7.4      PRODUCT WARRANTY - YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE. Changepoint warrants that the          Software, when used in accordance with the Documentation, is in all          material respects capable upon installation of accurately processing,          providing and/or receiving date data from, into and between the          twentieth and twenty-first centuries, including the years 1999 and          2000, and leap year calculations; provided that all licensee and third          party equipment, systems, hardware, software and firmware used in          combination with the Software properly exchange date data with the          Software and accurately process, provide and/or receive date data from,          into and between the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, including          the years 1999 and 2000, and leap year calculations. Changepoint's sole          liability under this Section 7.4 is limited to use of reasonable          efforts to correct or replace the defective Software with conforming          Software, and if neither of the foregoing are commercially practicable,          as determined by Changepoint in its reasonable discretion, Changepoint          may, at its option, terminate this Agreement and refund all prepaid          fees, if any. The foregoing are Corio's sole and exclusive remedies for          breach of this Year 2000 warranty and Changepoint's sole obligation.\n\n7.5      CORIO WARRANTIES. Corio represents and warrants that (i) it has the          right and power to enter into and fully perform this Agreement, (ii) in          entering into this Agreement, Corio is not, to the best of its          knowledge and belief, in breach of any contractual&sbsp;or other obligation          to any third party, (iii) it will comply with the terms of its          agreements with its Customers who purchase the right to use the          Software in connection with the Corio Services; (iv) it shall not make          any representations about the Software to third parties, including          Customers, which it is not authorized by Changepoint in writing to          make, or which are not set forth in the Documentation or other written          sales, marketing and training materials provided by Changepoint          intended for distribution to customers, and (v) it shall not make any          representations and warranties on behalf of Changepoint unless          expressly authorized by Changepoint in writing.\n\n7.6      DISCLAIMER. Except as expressly provided herein, CHANGEPOINT LICENSES          THE SOFTWARE TO CORIO ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS. NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY          OTHER WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR          OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR          CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, MERCHANTABLE QUALITY, NONINFRINGEMENT          AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n8        INDEMNIFICATION.\n\n8.1      BY CHANGEPOINT. Changepoint shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless          Corio and its Customers from any and all damages, liabilities, costs          and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) awarded by a court          against Corio or its Customers, and from settlements approved in          writing by Changepoint, arising out of any claim that the Software          infringes any patent, copyright, trademark or trade right secret of a          third party; provided that Corio or its Customer promptly notifies          Changepoint in writing of any such claim and promptly tenders\n\n                                       12\n\n         the control and the defense and settlement of any such claim to          Changepoint at Changepoint's expense and with Changepoint's choice          of counsel. Nothing in this provision shall limit Changepoint's          immediate duty to defend Corio and its Customers against any such          claims. Corio or its Customer shall cooperate with Changepoint, at          Changepoint's expense, in defending or settling such claims and          Corio or its Customer may join in defense with counsel of its choice          at its own expense. If the Software is, or in the opinion of          Changepoint may become, the subject of any claim of infringement or          if it is adjudicatively determined that the Software infringes, then          Changepoint may, at its sole option and expense, either (i) procure          for Corio the right from such third party to use the Software, (ii)          replace or modify the Software with other suitable and substantially          equivalent products so that the Software becomes noninfringing, or          if (i) and (ii) are not practicable after Changepoint has exhausted          all reasonable efforts, (iii) terminate this Agreement.\n\n8.2      LIMITATIONS. Changepoint shall have no liability for any infringement          based on (i) the use of the Software other than as set forth in the          Documentation; (ii) the modification of the Software by a party other          than Changepoint, when such infringement would not have occurred but          for such modification, (iii) the combination of the Software with any          other hardware or software product or service when such infringement\n\n\n\n\n\n         would not have occurred using the Software by itself or (iv) Corio's          copying, distribution or use of the Software after receiving          Changepoint's written notice to Corio of a third party claim of          infringement applicable to the Software.\n\n 8.3     BY CORIO. Corio shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Changepoint          and its affiliated companies from any and all damages, liabilities,          costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) awarded by a          court against Changepoint and its affiliated companies, and from          settlements approved in writing by Corio, for infringement of any          patent, copyright, trademark or trade right secret of a third party          arising out (i) use of the Software by Corio other than as set forth in          the Documentation or as authorized by this Agreement; (ii) modification          of the Software by Corio except as authorized by Changepoint or by this          Agreement, when such infringement would not have occurred but for such          unauthorized modification, (iii) Corio's copying, distribution or use          of the Software after receiving Changepoint's written notice to Corio          of a third party claim of infringement applicable to the Software, or          (iv) a combination of the Software with other hardware or software          product or service, if such infringement would not have occurred using          the Software alone. Corio's obligation to indemnify Changepoint is          subject to Changepoint providing Corio with prompt written notice of          any such claim and promptly tendering the control and the defense and          settlement of any such claim to Corio at Corio's expense and with          Corio's choice of counsel. Nothing in this provision shall limit          Corio's immediate duty to defend Changepoint against any such claims.          Changepoint shall cooperate with Corio, at Corio's expense, in          defending or settling any such claims and Changepoint may join in          defense with counsel of its choice at its own expense.\n\n9        LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n         EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY ARISING UNDER SECTIONS 2.7, 8, 10 AND 12.3 OF THIS          AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR          RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE          EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CORIO HEREUNDER FOR THE          TRANSACTION WHICH THE LIABILITY RELATES TO DURING THE TWELVE (12)          MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE CAUSE OF\n\n                                       13\n\n         ACTION FIRST ARISING, EVEN IF IT IS A CONTINUOUS ONE, OR IN THE          AGGREGATE, WITH RESPECT OF ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO          THIS AGREEMENT, THE TOTAL AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CORIO UNDER THIS          AGREEMENT TO CHANGEPOINT. EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY ARISING UNDER          SECTIONS 2.7, 8, 10 AND 12.3 OF THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL          EITHER PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOST          PROFITS OR COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR          FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTIAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES          HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY AND WHETHER OR NOT          SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. THE          PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS SECTION 9 REPRESENTS A REASONABLE ALLOCATION          OF RISK.\n\n10       CONFIDENTIALITY.\n\n         Each party hereby agrees that it shall not use any Confidential          Information received from the other party other than as expressly          permitted under the terms of the non-disclosure agreement in effect          between the parties dated October 29, 1999, which is incorporated          herein by reference and made a part hereof. For purposes of this          Agreement, \"Confidential Information\" means the definition given to          that term in such non-disclosure agreement. The parties agree that          Changepoint's Software and Documentation (except that Documentation          which this Agreement contemplates will be provided to Customers) shall          be deemed Confidential Information subject to that non-disclosure          agreement. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall also be          deemed Confidential Information subject to that non-disclosure          agreement, but the terms of this Agreement may be disclosed by a party          in connection with a significant transaction involving the merger or          sale of all or a substantial part of the assets of the receiving party.          Further, each party represents and warrants that their respective          employees, agents, contractors or consultants that will be provided the          other party's confidential information have or will have signed          agreements with customary terms containing confidentiality provisions          and assignment of inventions (\"EMPLOYEE NDA/INVENTION AGREEMENT\"). Each          party covenants that during the term of this Agreement, it will          continue to require all of such employees, agents, contractors or          consultants to sign an Employee NDA/Invention Agreement.\n\n11       TERM AND TERMINATION.\n\n11.1     TERM. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date          and, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, shall continue in          full force and effect for an initial period of five (5) years.          Thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically renew for subsequent one          (1) year periods unless either party provides the other party with          written notification at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration          of the initial five (5) year term or any one (1) year renewal thereof          of its intention to terminate this Agreement.\n\n11.2     TERMINATION. If either party breaches any material term or condition of          this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within sixty (60) days          after receiving written notice of the breach, the nonbreaching party\n\n\n\n\n\n         may terminate this Agreement on written notice at any time following          the end of such sixty (60) day period. Notwithstanding the foregoing,          Corio shall have thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of written          notice from Changepoint to cure any nonpayment. Compliance by the          Software with the Software's Documentation after expiration of the          Warranty Period shall be deemed a material condition of this Agreement.          To the extent permitted by applicable law, either party may terminate          this Agreement by\n\n                                       14\n\n         notice in writing to the other party in the event that (i) a          receiver, trustee, liquidator, administrator or administrative          receiver should be appointed for either party or its property, (ii)          either party should become insolvent or unable to pay its debts as          they mature or cease to pay its debts as they mature in the ordinary          course of business, or makes an assignment for the benefit of          creditors or makes a proposal to its creditors or files a notice of          intention to do so, (iii) any proceedings should be commenced          against either party under any bankruptcy, insolvency or debtor's          relief law, and such proceedings are not vacated or set aside within          fifteen (15) days from the date of commencement thereof, or (iv)          either party is liquidated or dissolved (except as part of an          assignment permitted under Section 14.1 of this Agreement).\n\n11.3     EFFECT OF TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION. The following Sections shall          survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement according to          the provisions of this Section 11.3: 2.1, 2,2, 2.3, 4.2, 4,5, 4.6, 4.7,          5.3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14 and Exhibits B and C.

Changepoint's obligation to provide Software Support          and Maintenance to Corio and its Customers shall survive any          termination or expiration of this Agreement for the remaining term of          any contracts Corio has with such Customers to continue providing the          Corio Services, provided Corio continues to make its revenue share fee          payments (and Software Support and Maintenance payments under Section          2.5 of this Agreement with respect to those licenses) to Changepoint as          specified in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the license          grants in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of this Agreement, and Changepoint's          continuing obligation to provide Software Support and Maintenance under          Sections 4.2 and 5.3 of this Agreement shall terminate if Changepoint          terminates this Agreement for Corio's non-payment or other material          breach according to the provisions of Section 11.2 of this Agreement.          Sections 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 14 of this Agreement shall survive          termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason. Upon          termination or expiration of this Agreement, each party shall otherwise          return or destroy any Confidential Information of the other party          provided, however, Corio may retain such Confidential Information as is          necessary for Corio to continue supporting it's then-existing Customers          according to the provisions of this Section 11.3. Upon termination or          expiration of this Agreement, all outstanding and unpaid amounts owed          by Corio to Changepoint under this Agreement shall become immediately          due and payable. Section 2.3 of this Agreement shall survive for the          time period provided in such section.\n\n12       SOURCE CODE ESCROW.\n\n12.1     ESCROW ACCOUNT. Within sixty (60) days of the Effective Date,          Changepoint agrees to execute an escrow agreement by and among Corio,          Changepoint and a mutually acceptable escrow agent (the \"ESCROW          AGENT\"). The Escrow Agent shall require Changepoint to place in an          escrow account in Toronto a copy of the source code of the Software          including all Updates and Upgrades thereto, documentation and similar          materials (the \"SOURCE CODE\"). The escrow agreement shall contain, at a          minimum, the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 12. Corio          shall bear all fees, expenses and other charges to open and maintain          such escrow account. If a Release Condition (as defined in Section 12.2          of this Agreement) occurs and the Escrow Agent provides the Source Code          to Corio under the escrow agreement, Corio agrees to hold the Source          Code in strict confidence, and not to use the Source Code for any          purpose other than those purposes set forth under Section 12.3 of this          Agreement. This\n\n                                       15\n\n         source code escrow shall survive any termination or expiration of          this Agreement for the remaining term of any contracts Corio has          with such Customers to continue providing the Corio Services.\n\n12.2     RELEASE. Corio shall notify Changepoint in writing if it believes that          one of the following events (the \"RELEASE CONDITIONS\") has occurred and          that it intends to seek release of the Source Code from the escrow          account: (i) Changepoint's dissolution or ceasing to do business in the          normal course, except as a result or a merger, amalgamation or sale of          all or a substantial part of the assets of Changepoint, or (ii)          Changepoint's repeated and material breach of Changepoint's Software          Support and Maintenance obligations defined under Section 5 of this          Agreement and EXHIBIT C pertaining to the correction of programming\n\n\n\n\n\n         errors and such breach is not cured within sixty (60) days of receipt          of written notice thereof from Corio. If Changepoint notifies Corio in          writing that it disputes whether any such event has occurred, officers          of each of the parties shall negotiate for a period of ten (10)          business days to attempt to resolve the dispute.

The parties agree to                       discuss the problem and negotiate in good faith without                       the necessity of any formal proceedings related thereto.                       No formal proceedings for the resolution of such dispute                       may be commenced until either party concludes in good                       faith that the applicable resolution through continued                       negotiation of the matter in issue does not appear likely.                       The parties further agree that all disputes hereunder                       which cannot be settled in the manner hereinbefore                       described (any such dispute is referred to here as a                       \"Dispute\") will be settled by final and binding                       arbitration conducted in accordance with the American                       Arbitration Association (or any successor thereto), as                       amended from time to time. Judgment upon the award                       rendered in any such arbitration may be entered in any                       court having jurisdiction thereof, or application may be                       made to such court for a judicial acceptance of the award                       and an enforcement, as the law of such jurisdiction may                       require or allow.\n\n         Notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes with respect to any Infringement Claim including without limitation any claim based on the infringement, violation or misappropriation of any Intellectual Property Right shall not be settled by arbitration, without the prior written consent of the parties.\n\n                      The arbitration panel will be composed of one person                       appointed by the party requesting the arbitration (the                       \"Applicant\"), one person appointed by the other party (the                       \"Respondent\") and a third person to act as chairperson,                       chosen by the two arbitrators, or, if both parties agree,                       the arbitration panel will consist of a sole arbitrator.                       No person may be appointed as an arbitrator unless he or                       she is independent of the Applicant and Respondent, is                       skilled in the subject matter of the Dispute and is not                       directly or indirectly carrying on or involved in a                       business being carried on in competition with the business                       of the parties. The decision of the arbitration panel                       shall be made by a majority vote or by the sole                       arbitrator, as the case may be. In the event of the                       failure of the arbitration panel to reach a majority                       decision, the decision of the chairperson shall constitute                       the decision of the arbitration panel. The venue for the                       arbitration shall be at the City of New York, New York                       unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing.\n\n                                       36\n\n                             CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT\n\nCorio/Changepoint Rev. 12/13/99\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidential/Draft\n\n                                   APPENDIX A\n\nThe Components which are the subject of the License, the Software Licenses granted to Customer and the fees payable to Changepoint hereunder are as follows:\n\n1.

If this Agreement terminates before the Expiration Date, you will pay us Liquidated Damages as follows:   14.4.1.1 If termination occurs before you begin the Hotel Work and before the Opening Date, and you or any Guarantor (or your or any Guarantor's Affiliates) directly or indirectly, enter into a franchise, license, management, lease and/or other similar agreement for or begin construction or commence operation of a hotel, motel, inn, or similar facility at the Hotel Site under a Competitor Brand within one (1) year after termination, then you will pay us Liquidated Damages in an amount equal to $3,600 multiplied by the number of approved Guest Rooms at the Hotel.   14.4.1.2 If termination occurs after you begin the Hotel Work but before the Opening Date, you will pay us Liquidated Damages in an amount equal to $3,600 multiplied by the number of approved Guest Rooms at the Hotel, unless your failure to complete the Hotel Work was the result of Force Majeure.   14.4.1.3 If termination occurs after the Effective Date but before the second anniversary of the Opening Date, you will pay us Liquidated Damages in an amount equal to $3,600 multiplied by the number of approved Guest Rooms at the Hotel.   14.4.1.4 If termination occurs after the second anniversary of the Opening Date but before the final five (5) calendar years of the Term, you will pay us Liquidated Damages in an amount calculated by dividing the sum of the Monthly Royalty Fees due to us under this Agreement for the prior twenty-four (24) month period by twenty-four (24) and then multiplying the resulting sum by sixty (60).   14.4.1.5 If there are less than sixty (60) months remaining in the Term on the date of termination, you will pay us Liquidated Damages in an amount calculated by dividing the sum of the Monthly Royalty Fees due to us under this Agreement for the prior twenty-four (24) month period by twenty-four (24) and then multiplying the resulting sum by the number of months remaining in the Term.   14.4.2 Payment of Liquidated Damages. Payment of Liquidated Damages is due thirty (30) days following termination of this Agreement or on demand.   14.5 Actual Damages Under Special Circumstances. You acknowledge that the Liquidated Damages described in Subsection 14.4 may be inadequate to compensate us for additional harm we may suffer, by reason of greater difficulty in re-entering the market, competitive damage to the System or the Network, damage to goodwill of the Marks, and other similar harm, under the following circumstances:   14.5.1 within twelve (12) months of each other, five (5) or more franchise agreements for the Brand between yourself (or any of your Affiliates) and us (or any of our Affiliates) terminate before their expiration date as a result of a breach by you or your Affiliate; or   14.5.2 this Agreement terminates due to an unapproved Transfer either to a (i) Competitor or (ii) buyer that converts the Hotel to a Competing Brand within two (2) years from the date this Agreement terminates.   14.5.3 In the circumstances set forth in Subsection 14.5.1 and 14.5.2, we reserve the right to seek actual damages in lieu of Liquidated Damages.   14.6 Your Obligations on Termination or Expiration. On termination or expiration of this Agreement, you will:   14.6.1 immediately pay all sums due and owing to us or any of the Entities, including any expenses incurred by us in obtaining injunctive relief for the enforcement of this Agreement;\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  14.6.2 immediately cease operating the Hotel as a System Hotel and cease using the System;   14.6.3 immediately cease using the Marks, the Trade Name, and any confusingly similar names, marks, trade dress systems, insignia, symbols, or other rights, procedures, and methods. You will deliver all goods and materials containing the Marks to us and we will have the sole and exclusive use of any items containing the Marks. You will immediately make any specified changes to the location as we may reasonably require for this purpose, which will include removal of the signs, custom decorations, and promotional materials;   14.6.4 immediately cease representing yourself as then or formerly a System Hotel or affiliated with the Brand or the Network;   14.6.5 immediately return all copies of the Manual and any other Proprietary Information to us;   14.6.6 immediately cancel all assumed name or equivalent registrations relating to your use of any Mark, notify the telephone company and all listing agencies and directory publishers including Internet domain name granting authorities, Internet service providers, global distribution systems, and web search engines of the termination or expiration of your right to use the Marks, the Trade Name, and any telephone number, any classified or other telephone directory listings, Internet domain names, uniform resource locators, website names, electronic mail addresses and search engine metatags and keywords associated with the Hotel, and authorize their transfer to us; and   14.6.7 irrevocably assign and transfer to us (or to our designee) all of your right, title and interest in any domain name listings and registrations that contain any reference to our Marks, System, Network or Brand; notify the applicable domain name registrars of the termination of your right to use any domain name or Sites associated with the Marks or the Brand; and authorize and instruct the cancellation of the domain name, or transfer of the domain name to us (or our designee), as we specify. You will also delete all references to our Marks, System, Network or Brand from any Sites you own, maintain or operate beyond the expiration or termination of this Agreement.   15.0 INDEMNITY   15.1 Beginning on the Effective Date, you must indemnify the Indemnified Parties against, and hold them harmless from, all losses, costs, liabilities, damages, claims, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, expert fees, costs and other expenses of litigation arising out of or resulting from:   15.1.1 any breach by you of this Agreement, the Manual or the Standards;   15.1.2 any act or omission of you or your officers, employees, Affiliates, associates or agents in any way arising out of or relating to this Agreement;   15.1.3 any claimed occurrence at the Hotel including personal injury, death or property damage;   15.1.4 your alleged or actual infringement or violation of any patent, Mark or copyright or other proprietary right owned or controlled by third parties;   15.1.5 your alleged or actual violation or breach of any contract (including any group sales agreement for the System), any Law, or any industry standard;   15.1.6 any business conducted by you or a third party in, on or about the Hotel or Hotel Site and\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  15.1.7 your failure to comply with Subsection 17.13, including a breach of the representations set forth therein.   15.2 You do not have to indemnify an Indemnified Party to the extent damages otherwise covered under this Section 15 are adjudged by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have been solely the result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of that Indemnified Party, and not any of the acts, errors, omissions, negligence or misconduct of you or anyone related to you or the Hotel. You may not rely on this exception to your indemnity obligation if the claims were asserted against us or any other Indemnified Party on the basis of theories of imputed or secondary liability, such as vicarious liability, agency, or apparent agency, or our failure to compel you to comply with the provisions of this Agreement, including compliance with Standards, Laws or other requirements.   15.3 You will give us written notice of any action, suit, proceeding, claim, demand, inquiry or investigation involving an Indemnified Party within five (5) days of your knowledge of it. At our election, you will defend us and/or the Indemnified Parties against the same or we may elect to assume (but under no circumstance will we be obligated to undertake) the defense and/or settlement of the action, suit, proceeding, claim, demand, inquiry or investigation at your expense and risk.   15.4 If we think our respective interests conflict, we may obtain separate counsel of our choice. This will not diminish your obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Parties and to hold them harmless. You will reimburse the Indemnified Parties on demand for all expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, expert fees, costs and other expenses of litigation, the Indemnified Parties incur to protect themselves or to remedy your defaults. The Indemnified Parties will not be required to seek recovery from third parties or otherwise mitigate their losses to maintain a claim against you, and their failure to do so will not reduce the amounts recoverable from you by the Indemnified Parties.   15.6 Your obligations under this Section 15 will survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.   16.0 RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES   16.1 No Agency Relationship. You are an independent contractor. Neither Party is the legal representative or agent of the other Party nor has the power to obligate the other Party for any purpose. You acknowledge that we do not supervise or direct your daily affairs and that you have exclusive control over your daily affairs. You expressly acknowledge that the Parties have a business relationship based entirely on, and defined by, the express provisions of this Agreement and that no partnership, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship is intended or created by reason of this Agreement.   16.2 Notices to Public Concerning Your Independent Status. All contracts for the Hotel's operations and services at the Hotel will be in your name or in the name of your Management Company. You will not enter into or sign any contracts in our name or any Entity's name or using the Marks or any acronyms or variations of the Marks. You will disclose in all dealings with the public, suppliers and third parties that you are an independent entity and that we have no liability for your debts.   17.0 MISCELLANEOUS   17.1 Severability and Interpretation.   17.1.1 if any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, void or voidable, that provision will be ineffective only to the extent of the prohibition, without in any way invalidating or affecting the remaining provisions of this Agreement, and all remaining provisions will continue in effect, unless the unenforceability of the provision frustrates the underlying purpose of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable due to its scope, but may be made enforceable by limiting its scope, the provision will be considered amended to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  17,1.2 This Agreement will be interpreted without interpreting any provision in favor of or against either Party by reason of the drafting of the provision, or either of our positions relative to the other.   17.1.3 Any covenant, term or provision of this Agreement that provides for continuing obligations after the expiration or termination of this Agreement will survive any expiration or termination.   17.2 Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue.   17.2.1 The Parties agree that, except to the extent governed by the United States Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham Act; 15 U.S.C.  lj 1050 et seq.), as amended, this Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without recourse to New York choice of law or conflicts of law principles. Nothing in this Section is intended to invoke the application of any franchise, business opportunity, antitrust, \"implied covenant,\" unfair competition, fiduciary or any other doctrine of law of the State of New York or any other state that would not otherwise apply absent this Subsection 17.2.1.   17.2.2 The Parties agree that any action brought pursuant to this Agreement or the relationship between them must be brought in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, in Alexandria, Virginia, or if that court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then in a court of competent jurisdiction whose jurisdiction includes either Fairfax County, Virginia or New York, New York, or in the county and state where the Hotel is located. You consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in each of these jurisdictions and waive, and agree not to assert, move or otherwise claim that the venue in any of these jurisdictions is for any reason improper, inconvenient, prejudicial or otherwise inappropriate.   17.3 Exclusive Benefit. This Agreement is exclusively for our and your benefit, and none of the obligations of you or us in this Agreement will run to, or be enforceable by, any other party (except for any rights we assign or delegate to one of the Entities or covenants in favor of the Entities, which rights and covenants will run to and be enforceable by the Entities or their successors and assigns) or give rise to liability to a third party, except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Agreement.   17.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and all of its attachments, documents, schedules, exhibits, and any other information specifically incorporated into this Agreement by reference (including any representations in any franchise disclosure document that we provided to you for the Brand in connection with the offer of this License) will be construed together as the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the Hotel and any other aspect of our relationship and will supersede and cancel any prior and/or contemporaneous discussions or writings between you and us.   17.5 Amendment and Waiver.   17.5.1 No change, termination, or attempted waiver or cancellation of any provision of this Agreement will bind us unless it is in writing, specifically designated as an amendment or waiver, and signed by one of our officers. We may condition our agreement to any amendment or waiver on receiving from you, in a form satisfactory to us, an estoppel and general release of claims that you may have against us, the Entities, and related parties.   17.5.2 No failure by us or by any of the Entities to exercise any power given us under this Agreement or to insist on strict compliance by you with any of your obligations, and no custom or practice at variance with the terms of this Agreement, will be considered a waiver of our or any Entity's right to demand exact compliance with the terms of this Agreement.   17.6 Consent; Business Judgment.   17.6.1 Wherever our consent or approval is required in this Agreement, unless the provision specifically indicates otherwise, we have the right to withhold our approval at our option, in our business judgment, taking into consideration our assessment of the long-term interests of the Systemoverall. We may withhold any and all consents or approvals required by this Agreement if you are in default or breach of this Agreement. Our approvals and consents will not be effective unless given in writing and signed by one of our duly authorized representatives.\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  17.6.2 You agree not to make a claim for money damages based on any allegation that we have unreasonably withheld or delayed any consent or approval to a proposed act by you under the terms of this Agreement. You also may not claim damages by way of set- off, counterclaim or defense for our withholding of consent. Your sole remedy for the claim will be an action or proceeding to enforce the provisions of this Agreement by specific performance or by declaratory judgment.   17.7 Notices. Notices under this Agreement must be in writing and must be delivered in person, by prepaid overnight commercial delivery service, or by prepaid overnight mail, registered or certified, with return-receipt requested.

Effective Date and Term\n\n2.1 This Agreement is effective June 11, 2015 (the \"Effective Date\"). The Agreement shall continue through the project's in-service date and for a period of fifteen (15) years after the project's in-service date (\"Initial Term\"). MPL shall provide written notice to Shipper\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\nconfirming the project's in-service date. Shipper acknowledges that the overall Project will be completed in several phases. New infrastructure will be completed first, with additional build-out projects and expansions completed in succession. MPL will provide a thirty (30) day notice to Shipper, notifying it of the actual in-service date for the included projects.\n\n2.2 This Agreement shall be binding upon the Parties under the same conditions and provisions for a time period commencing on the Effective Date and shall continue through the Initial Term. This Agreement will automatically renew for up to two (2) renewal terms of five (5) years each (each, an \"Extension Period\") unless either Party provides the other Party with written notice of its intent to terminate this Agreement at least six (6) months prior to the end of the Initial Term or the then current Extension Period. The Initial Term and Extension Period, if any, shall be referred to in this Agreement as the \"Term\".\n\n2.3 In the event Shipper does not wish to renew after the Initial Term or Extension Period or chooses to terminate the Agreement by written notice pursuant to Section 2.2, MPL reserves the option and right to hold a subsequent open season in which interested shippers can have opportunity to contract for resulting available volume, rate, and terms.\n\n3. Volume Commitment and Quarterly Deficiency Charges\n\n3.1 Shipper guarantees that during each Contract Year, Shipper will meet its Quarterly Volume Commitment or, in the event it fails to do so, shall remit to MPL the Quarterly Deficiency Payment pursuant to Section 3.5. All volumes moved by Shipper on the Pipeline will be subject to the applicable Tariff Rates and proration policies, as may be amended from time to time in accordance with FERC methodologies and as provided herein.\n\n3.2 Shipper will have the opportunity to fulfill its Quarterly Volume Commitment on a calendar quarter basis for condensate, natural gasoline, and diluent service. These three Products are interchangeable from a volume commitment standpoint and shipping a total volume of any one or combination of these Products will be applied towards the Quarterly Volume Commitment. Should MPL proceed with butane service, Shipper will also have the opportunity to fulfill its Quarterly Volume Commitment on a calendar quarter basis for butane service, separate from condensate, natural gasoline, and diluent service.\n\n3.3 Shipper shall be deemed to have shipped its Quarterly Volume Commitment on the Pipeline if the quantity of Product that Shipper ships on the Pipeline in any Quarter equals at least the Quarterly Volume Commitment for such Quarter.\n\n3.4 Shipper agrees to pay MPL monthly: (a) the Tariff Rates in effect for all Shipper Deliveries transported by MPL on the Pipeline during such month; and (b) any loading, handling, transfer and other charges incurred with respect to such Shipper Deliveries for such month in accordance with the provisions as set forth in the Tariffs (or any other tariffs that may be applicable to such Shipper Deliveries). If the amount owed by Shipper is the subject of a good faith dispute, Shipper shall be obligated to pay only the undisputed portion of such amount pending the resolution of such dispute in accordance with this Agreement. Late payments of undisputed amounts shall accrue interest at a rate equal to two percent (2%) per annum, until paid. Such payments will be paid by Shipper to MPL within fifteen (15) Days of the invoice date or resolution of any dispute, if applicable.\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5 Subject to the provisions of Section 5 of this Agreement, if the volume of each Product shipped by Shipper on the Pipeline during the Quarter is less than the applicable Quarterly Volume Commitment for that Product then, in addition to paying any amounts incurred by Shipper pursuant to Section 3.4 with respect to Shipper Deliveries for such Quarter, Shipper shall also pay MPL a deficiency payment (the \"Quarterly Deficiency Payment\"); equal to the product of:\n\n(a) the difference between the applicable Quarterly Volume Commitment for that Product for such Quarter and the volume of Shipper Deliveries of that Product on the Pipeline for such Quarter (the \"Deficiency Volume\"); and\n\n(b) the applicable Tariff Rate for that Product for such Quarter.\n\nEach Product to which the Shipper is obligated to move as part of its committed volumes will be added together for one total Quarterly Deficiency Payment.\n\nShipper's transportation of commodities outside this Agreement's definition of Product will not satisfy the obligation to move committed Product volume. All Product barrels moved by Shipper in excess of its Quarterly Volume Commitment will be attributed to Shipper's movements on the Pipeline as a Regular Shipper, subject to the applicable Rules & Regulations of the Tariff.\n\n3.6 The dollar amount of any Quarterly Deficiency Payment paid by Shipper shall constitute prepayment for transportation of Product by Shipper on the Pipeline and will posted as a credit (\"Prepaid Transportation Credits\") to Shipper's account for that type of Product. If, during any Quarter of the Contract Year, Shipper deliveries on the Pipeline exceed the applicable Quarterly Volume Commitment requirements, Shipper shall be permitted to apply Prepaid Transportation Credits against any amount due from Shipper and payable to MPL with respect to the transportation of volumes on the Pipeline for such Quarter. Any Prepaid Transportation Credits that are not used by Shipper during the four (4) Quarters immediately following the Quarter for which said Prepaid Transportation Credits were posted to Shipper's account (the \"Credit Period\") will expire. Those Prepaid Transportation Credits that are in payment dispute in accordance with Section 3.4, shall be posted as a credit on the date the payment dispute is resolved. If during any such four (4) Quarter period the nominated volume on the Pipeline for any month equals or exceeds the applicable portion in the Quarterly Volume Commitment for the Pipeline for such month (the \"Monthly Commitment\"), but Shipper is prevented from shipping volumes in excess of the Monthly Commitment because of lack of available capacity, either because (a) the Pipeline is in allocation and Shipper is specifically subject to allocation per Exhibit C, (b) the Pipeline is undergoing testing, maintenance or repair, or (c) a Force Majeure has occurred that prevents MPL from transporting Shipper volumes on the Pipeline in excess of the Monthly Commitment, then the Credit Period shall be extended by an equivalent time period for which Shipper has been prevented from shipping volumes in excess of the Monthly Commitment. For the purposes of this Section 3.6, during the Term, if the Pipeline is in allocation for any portion of the month, the Pipeline will be considered to be in allocation for the entirety of such month.\n\n3.7 Notwithstanding anything in Section 3.5 to the contrary, upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason to the extent that Shipper, at the time of such expiration or termination, holds any unused Prepaid Transportation Credits, Shipper shall be permitted to apply such Prepaid Transportation Credits against any amounts incurred by Shipper and\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\npayable to MPL with respect to any Shipper deliveries on the Pipeline until the expiration of the applicable Credit Period with respect to such Prepaid Transportation Credits. This Section 3.7 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n3.8 Shipper may not apply Prepaid Transportation Credits on differing types of Products; i.e, a Shipper may not use Prepaid Transportation Credits received for butane service on condensate, natural gasoline, or diluent service, or vice versa. Condensate, natural gasoline, and diluent are interchangeable from a volume commitment standpoint and shipping a total volume of any one or combination of these Products will be applied towards the Quarterly Volume Commitment. Should MPL proceed with butane service, Shipper will also have the opportunity to fulfill its Quarterly Volume Commitment on a calendar quarter basis for butane service, separate from condensate, natural gasoline, and diluent service.\n\n3.9 If, following the binding open season and prior to the in-service date of the Tariff, MPL determines that it has available capacity not subscribed to during the binding open season, not to exceed 90% of Project Capacity (\"Unsubscribed Capacity\"), to the extent permitted by Governmental Authority; MPL will provide Shipper the right to increase its Quarterly Volume Commitment as submitted on its Capacity Request Form on Exhibit C. MPL will provide at least sixty (60) days' advance written notice, simultaneously, to all shippers (including Shipper) who have executed a transportation service agreement during the binding open season of the availability and volume of Unsubscribed Capacity for additional volume commitments (the \"Additional Volume Commitments\"). No later than thirty (30) days following the date of MPL's written notice, Shipper must provide MPL with a written binding commitment identifying the additional volumes to be added to its Quarterly Volume Commitment (\"Pre-Service Increase Request\"). In the event MPL receives Pre-Service Increase Requests that are, in aggregate, less than or equal to the Unsubscribed Capacity, each shipper's volume commitment shall be increased by the volume of its Pre-Service Increase Request. In the event MPL receives Pre-Service Increase Requests that would, in aggregate, exceed the Unsubscribed Capacity, all Shippers will be allocated their Pre-Service Increases pro rata based on their then- current volume commitments. If Shipper makes a Pre-Service Increase Request, MPL shall notify Shipper of its new Quarterly Volume Commitment within thirty (30) days following receipt of Shipper's Pre-Service Increase Request, and Exhibit C shall be deemed revised to reflect Shipper's new volume commitment, which shall equal the sum of its original Capacity Request Form volume commitment and its Pre-Service Increase Request or its allocated portion thereof pursuant to this Section 3.9. If there is still Unsubscribed Capacity after shippers (including Shipper) exercise Additional Volume Commitments as set forth above, MPL may conduct a second open season to obtain additional volume commitments for any remaining Unsubscribed Capacity.\n\n4. Transportation Charges\n\n4.1 Shipper shall pay MPL a transportation charge for each Barrel of Product shipped under the terms of this Agreement and Exhibit C, at the rates provided for in Exhibit B, which shall be the Tariff Rates for the volume commitment on the Day of delivery of Product.\n\n4.2 The rates in Exhibit B will be adjusted annually in accordance with the standard FERC annual oil pipeline indexing methodology in effect at the time of the escalation. There shall be no downward adjustment of the Rates in the event the annual FERC oil pipeline index rate is negative. Rates will typically be indexed during July of each year and would be first indexed in July of the year following project completion.\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3 If during the term of this Agreement, MPL becomes obligated as a result of a Change in Law Event to bear Compliance Costs, MPL shall have the right to increase the Tariff Rates on the Pipeline, including Shipper's committed rate as originally executed on Exhibit B in this Agreement or to impose a surcharge on its shippers (including Shipper) to recover such Compliance Costs. If MPL determines to recover any Compliance Costs from its shippers, it will do so in a manner that is reasonable and equitable to all shippers on the Pipeline.\n\n4.4 A \"Committed Priority Shipper\" will receive transportation service exempt from prorationing provisions under normal operating conditions for its contractually committed volumes, in exchange for a commitment to transport (or pay for) those volumes, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement executed during the open season process. The rates vary depending upon project options, but in all instances will be $0.01 per barrel above the rates for uncommitted service for the same origin and destination points. A Committed Priority Shipper will have the same rates as the Committed Non-Priority Shipper (as defined below), unless the system in under prorationing. When under prorationing, the Committed Priority Shipper's rate will be charged the premium rate of $0.01 above the posted uncommitted rate. Shipper shall not be a Committed Priority Shipper solely through this Agreement. Shipper must submit a Capacity Request Form during MPL's binding open season (Exhibit C) which confirms the Shipper has elected Committed Priority Shipper Status.\n\n4.5 A \"Committed Non-Priority Shipper\" will receive transportation service subject to prorationing provisions for its contractually committed volumes, in exchange for a commitment to transport (or pay for) those volumes, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement executed during the open season process. Those who elect to become a Committed Non-Priority Shipper will receive the benefit of discounted rates that will not be available to the Committed Priority Shippers or the uncommitted shippers. The rates will vary depending upon project options and commitment duration. MPL will not presume Shipper to be a Committed Non-Priority Shipper solely through this Agreement, unless the Capacity Request Form submitted by Shipper during MPL's binding open season (Exhibit C) shows the Shipper has elected Committed Non-Priority Shipper Status.\n\n5. Force Majeure\n\n5.1 As soon as possible upon the occurrence of a Force Majeure event, the affected Party shall provide the other Party written notice of the occurrence of such Force Majeure event (a \"Force Majeure Notice\"). A Party shall identify the full particulars and the approximate length of time that the Party reasonably believes in good faith such Force Majeure event shall continue (the \"Force Majeure Period\"). If a Party advises in any Force Majeure Notice that it reasonably believes in good faith that the Force Majeure Period shall continue for more than twelve (12) consecutive months, then, subject to Section 10 below, at any time after a Party delivers such Force Majeure Notice, either Party may terminate this Agreement, but only upon delivery to the other Party of a notice (a \"Termination Notice\") at least twelve (12) months prior to the expiration of the Force Majeure Period; provided, however, that such Termination Notice shall be deemed canceled and of no effect if the Force Majeure Period ends prior to the expiration of such twelve (12) months period. For the avoidance of doubt, neither Party may exercise its right under this Section 5.1 to terminate this Agreement as a result of a Force Majeure event with respect to any machinery, storage, tanks, lines of pipe or other equipment that has been unaffected by, or has been restored to working order since, the applicable Force Majeure event.\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Shipper delivers a Termination Notice to MPL and, within thirty (30) days after receiving such notice, MPL notifies Shipper that MPL reasonably believes in good faith that it shall be capable of fully performing under its obligations under this Agreement within a reasonable period of time, then the Shipper Termination Notice shall be deemed revoked and the applicable portion of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as if such Shipper Termination Notice had never been given.\n\n5.3 Subject to Section 6 of this Agreement, MPL's obligation to transport on the Pipeline may be temporarily suspended during occurrences of, and for the entire duration of, a Force Majeure event that prevents MPL from transporting on the Pipeline. If MPL is unable to transport due to a Force Majeure event or otherwise, then Shipper's obligation to ship the applicable Quarterly Volume Commitment and pay the applicable Quarterly Deficiency Payment shall be reduced to the extent that MPL is prevented from shipping the full applicable Quarterly Volume Commitment. At such time as MPL is capable of transporting volumes equal to the full applicable Quarterly Volume Commitment on the Pipeline, Shipper's obligation to ship the full Quarterly Volume Commitment shall be restored.\n\n6. Capabilities of the Pipeline System\n\n6.1 MPL shall use reasonable commercial efforts to minimize the disruption of service on the Pipeline and any portion thereof. MPL shall promptly inform Shipper of any anticipated partial or complete disruption of service on the Pipeline, including relevant information about the nature, extent, cause and expected duration of the disruption and the actions MPL is taking to resume full operations, provided that MPL shall not have any liability for any failure to notify, or delay in notifying, Shipper of any such matters except to the extent Shipper has been materially prejudiced or damaged by such failure or delay.\n\n6.2 Subject to Force Majeure, disruptions for routine repair and maintenance consistent with pipeline industry standards and any requirements of Applicable Law, MPL shall accept for shipment on the Pipeline in accordance with pipeline industry standard Product. Further, MPL shall maintain and repair all portions of the Pipeline in accordance with pipeline industry standards and in a manner which allows the Pipeline to be capable, subject to Force Majeure or temporary shutdown for pipeline testing and maintenance, of shipping, storing and delivering volumes of Product.\n\n6.3 If the Shipper has agreed to pay, pursuant to Exhibit B and Exhibit C, a premium rate for transportation of Product on the Pipeline, the Shipper Deliveries shall not be reduced under normal operating conditions if the capacity for Product shipments is otherwise subject to prorationing in accordance with the prorationing provisions in MPL's Rules and Regulations Tariff.\n\n6.4 If, for any reason, including without limitation a Force Majeure event, the capacity of the Pipeline is reduced, then (a) during such period of reduced capacity, Shipper's obligation shall be reduced as described above in this Section 6; and (b) within a reasonable period of time after commencement of such reduction, MPL shall make repairs to and/or replace the affected portion of the Pipeline to restore capacity. MPL shall use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to provide transportation of Product tendered by Shipper under the Tariffs while restoration is being completed. Any work performed by MPL pursuant to this Section 6.4\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\nshall be performed and completed in a good and workmanlike manner consistent with applicable pipeline industry standards and in accordance with all applicable laws.\n\n6.5 Expansion of Pipeline. MPL reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to expand the capacity of the Pipeline at any time or from time to time.\n\n6.6 Right of Shipper to Secure Expansion Capacity. In the event that MPL decides in its sole discretion to expand the capacity of the Pipeline, then:\n\n(a) MPL will provide each Shipper with notice of such proposed expansion not less than one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to the expected in-service date of such proposed expansion (\"Expansion Notice\") and such Expansion Notice shall include:\n\n(i) the amount of the proposed expansion capacity;\n\n(ii) the expected rates and rules and regulations that will apply to such expansion capacity;\n\n(iii) the expected in-service date of such expansion/extension.\n\nThe costs of any expansion shall not be rolled into the rates associated with any Pipeline capacity existing prior to such expansion.\n\n(b) To the extent permitted by Governmental Authorities, MPL will provide to each Shipper a first right, on terms and conditions specified by MPL that is consistent with this first right, to submit a binding nomination to ship, or otherwise pay for, a committed volume of Product on the expansion capacity (\"Requested Expansion Volume Commitment\"). The amount of expansion capacity available for volume commitments pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall not exceed ninety percent (90%) of the total expansion capacity. No later than sixty (60) days following the date of MPL's Expansion Notice, Shipper must commit to, in a form acceptable to MPL in MPL's sole discretion, its Requested Expansion Volume Commitment (\"Election Deadline\"). In the event that, pursuant to this first right, MPL receives binding commitments for volumes that exceed the expansion capacity available for committed volumes, each Shipper that submitted a binding commitment pursuant to this first right procedure shall be allocated the lesser of: (i) its Requested Expansion Volume Commitment, or (ii) the Shipper's pro-rata share of the expansion capacity available for committed volumes, which shall be calculated by multiplying (1) the Shipper's Proportionate Share, times (2) the expansion capacity available for committed volumes (\"Expansion Volume Commitment\"). MPL shall notify Shipper of its Expansion Volume Commitment within thirty (30) days following the Election Deadline, and the Parties shall promptly execute a new and separate transportation service agreement reflecting Shipper's Expansion Volume Commitment. Any calculation of an Expansion Volume Commitment shall be without regard to and shall not affect any Volume Commitment on pre-existing capacity.\n\n(c) In the event that any expansion capacity available for committed volumes remains after the procedure set forth in Section 6.6 is completed, MPL has the right, in its sole discretion, to offer such committed capacity pursuant to an open season in which all interested shippers will be given an opportunity to commit to transport a specified volume of Product on such remaining expansion capacity, subject to the terms and conditions specified by MPL pursuant to or in connection with such open season.\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n7 Confidentiality\n\n7.1 From and after the Effective Date, each Party shall hold, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective directors, managers, officers, employees, agents, consultants, advisors, contractors, and other representatives (collectively, \"Representatives\") to hold all Confidential Information of the other Party in strict confidence, with at least the same degree of care that applies to such Party's confidential and proprietary information and shall not use such Confidential Information except in connection with its performance or acceptance of services hereunder and shall not release or disclose such Confidential Information to any other Person, except its Representatives. Each Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 7 by any of its Representatives.\n\n7.2 If a Party receives a subpoena or other demand for disclosure of Confidential Information received from any other Party or must disclose to a Governmental Authority any Confidential Information received from such other Party in order to obtain or maintain any required governmental approval, the receiving Party shall, to the extent legally permissible, provide notice to the providing Party before disclosing such Confidential Information. Upon receipt of such notice, the providing Party shall promptly either seek an appropriate protective order, waive the receiving Party's confidentiality obligations hereunder to the extent necessary to permit the receiving Party to respond to the demand, or otherwise fully satisfy the subpoena or demand or the requirements of the applicable Governmental Authority. If the receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose such Confidential Information or if the providing Party does not promptly respond as contemplated by this Section 7, the receiving Party may disclose that portion of Confidential Information covered by the notice or demand.\n\n7.3 Each Party acknowledges that the disclosing Party would not have an adequate remedy at law for the breach by the receiving Party of any one or more of the covenants contained in this Section 7 and agrees that, in the event of such breach, the disclosing Party may, in addition to the other remedies that may be available to it, apply to a court for an injunction to prevent breaches of this Section 7 and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Section 7. Notwithstanding any other section hereof, the provisions of this Section 7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\n\n8. Assignment\n\n8.1 Neither Party may assign its rights under this Agreement without prior written consent from the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that either Party may assign its rights under this Agreement to a successor in interest resulting from any merger, reorganization, consolidation or as part of a sale of all or substantially all of its assets. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Parties hereto.\n\n9. Representations and Warranties\n\n9.1 Each Party to this Agreement represents and warrants to the other that it is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of its organization and has all requisite corporate power and corporate authority to enter into this Agreement and to carry out the terms and provisions hereof.\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2 MPL shall take reasonable steps to obtain all necessary approvals, and authorizations of all Governmental Authorities to modify and operate the Pipeline, including approval by FERC of the rate structure and any premium service, and all other approvals and authorizations necessary, in MPL's sole opinion, desirable in connection with the provision of Product transportation, in each case, in form and substance acceptable to MPL in its sole discretion.\n\n9.3 Shipper hereby agrees (a) to take all such actions and do all such things as MPL reasonably requests in connections with its application for, and the processing of necessary approvals and authorizations of the FERC and other governmental authorities, (b) at all times to support the rate and (c) to not, directly or indirectly, take any action that is designed to or may delay review or approval of the applications to FERC or any other Governmental Authority or indicate a lack of support for the modifications of the Pipeline or the rate.\n\n10. Termination and Amendment\n\n10.1 This Agreement may not be terminated, except as expressly provided herein, nor may any of its provisions be amended or waived without prior written consent of both Parties hereto.\n\n10.2 Neither failure nor delay by MPL or Shipper to exercise any right or remedy provided herein shall operate as a waiver with respect to a future exercise thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy.\n\n10.3 Except as otherwise provided in Section 10.5, in the event of any breach of a term or condition of this Agreement by either Party, the other Party's remedy shall be limited to the direct damages caused thereby and in no event shall a Party be liable to the other Party for any consequential, indirect, pecuniary, punitive, or economic damages, howsoever caused.\n\n10.4 Upon termination of this Agreement for reasons other than a default by Shipper, pursuant to any provisions of this Agreement or any other termination of this Agreement initiated by Shipper pursuant to Section 5, Shipper shall have the right to require MPL to enter into a new transportation service agreement with Shipper that (a) is consistent with the terms and objectives set forth in this Agreement and (b) has commercial terms that are, in the aggregate, equal to or more favorable to Shipper than fair market value terms as would be agreed by similarly-situated parties negotiating at arm's length provided.\n\n10.5 Shipper acknowledges that MPL will incur certain building, expansion and improvement costs associated with its performance under this Agreement prior to the commencement of transportation service on the Pipeline. Shipper also acknowledges that MPL relied on the volume commitments received from Shipper on its Capacity Request Form in Exhibit C as part of an aggregate volume commitment received from all committed shippers during the binding open season to finalize the Project's ultimate scope, including but not limited to, pipe size, routing and destinations. If MPL is in compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and Shipper decides to terminate this Agreement after the Effective Date but prior to the commencement of transportation service on the Pipeline, Shipper shall notify MPL of its decision to terminate within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the Project's in-service date to allow MPL the opportunity to provide Shipper's unwanted capacity to other interested shippers as Unsubscribed Capacity as set forth in Section 3.8. If Shipper fails to notify MPL within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the Project's in-service date or if MPL is unsuccessful in obtaining additional volume commitments as provided for in Section 3.8 to\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\nfully replace Shipper's original volume commitment as submitted in its Capacity Request Form in Exhibit C, Shipper will reimburse MPL for Shipper's pro rata portion of actual and committed Construction Costs, plus, an administrative fee of ten (10) percent of said costs (such reimbursement is hereinafter referred to as the \"Construction Cost Reimbursement\"). The Parties agree that the Construction Cost Reimbursement shall be deemed liquidated damages and that such amount shall not be deemed a penalty, but rather represents a reasonable amount of liquidated damages in light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by Shipper's termination of this Agreement as stated, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or non- feasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy, and that the payment of such amount shall be MPL's sole and exclusive remedy for such termination by Shipper.\n\n10.6 The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement may be contingent on the Shipper executing a reasonably acceptable commodity supply agreement. Shipper must notify MPL if it is unable to execute a reasonably acceptable commodity supply agreement within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the Project in-service date. Furthermore, Shipper must make commercially reasonable efforts to enter into a commodity supply agreement within the one hundred and eighty (180) days. Provided, however, that Shipper acknowledges and agrees that Shipper remains responsible for the Construction Cost Reimbursement provided for in Section 10.5 of this Agreement if it is unable to reach and execute a commodity supply agreement within the required timeframe. 11. Conditions Precedent\n\nNotwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement is subject to the receipt by MPL of:\n\n11.1 All certificates, approvals and authorizations of any Governmental Authority deemed necessary or desirable by MPL in connection with this Agreement and, in each case, in form and substance acceptable to MPL in its sole discretion.\n\n11.2 Executed Transportation Service Agreements, in form and substance acceptable to MPL in its sole discretion, as MPL shall deem sufficient in its sole discretion to support the economic viability of the costs associated with the Project.\n\n11.3 Executed Transportation Service Agreements, in form and substance acceptable to both MPL and Shipper.\n\nIf any terms of this Agreement are required to be modified in accordance with a decision, approval or authorization from FERC or any other governmental authority, the Parties agree to reasonably cooperate with one another in amending this Agreement to align with those decisions, approvals and authorizations from FERC or any other governmental agencies. If these conditions precedent are not satisfied for MPL after exercising commercially reasonable efforts to meet such condition precedent, MPL shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by written notice to Shipper. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 11, MPL and Shipper shall be released from any and all obligations under this Agreement.\n\n12. Offer\n\n12.1 The submission of an unexecuted copy of this Agreement by MPL to Shipper shall not constitute an offer.\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n12.2 Shipper acknowledges that, upon closing of the open season described in the notice of open season, MPL will undertake significant alterations and improvements and will incur significant expense in connection with the Project. In consideration of the foregoing and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged by Shipper, Shipper agrees that the submission of an executed Agreement to MPL shall constitute an offer by Shipper. Shipper further agrees that its offer shall remain irrevocable; provided, however, that if Shipper has not received an executed copy of this Agreement from MPL within sixty (60) days after the close of the Binding Open Season, Shipper may revoke its offer thereafter by written notice to MPL, and upon such revocation, this Agreement will become null and void.\n\n13.

Default\n\n16.1 Either Party hereunder shall be in default if such Party: (a) materially breaches any provision of this Agreement and such breach is not cured within fifteen (15) Days after notice thereof (which notice shall describe such breach in reasonable detail) is received by such Party; (b) becomes insolvent, enters voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; (c) fails to pay any undisputed sums due hereunder; or (d) fails to provide satisfactory financial assurance as provided for in Section 17.\n\n16.2 If either Party is in default as described above, then the non-defaulting Party may: (a) terminate this Agreement upon notice to the defaulting Party; (b) withhold any payments due to the defaulting Party under this Agreement; and/or (c) pursue any other remedy at law or in equity if such breach is not remedied as provided for in Section 14.1.\n\n17.

Financial Assurances shall be limited to a guarantee from the parent company of Shipper in a form and substance acceptable to MPL and sufficient in amount to cover 6-months of Shipper's obligations to MPL so long as the guarantor has sufficient creditworthiness as set forth in this Section; and if not, MPL may then request an irrevocable standby letter of credit in a form and from an issuer acceptable to MPL, and in an amount no greater than 6-months of tolls based on the Quarterly Volume Commitment, plus all applicable taxes.\n\n17.2 As of the Project's in-service date, Shipper shall comply with the credit requirements and provide the financial assurances required in the Tariff so long as the Tariff is consistent with the terms of this Agreement. 17.3 Any failure of Shipper to comply with the provisions of this Section 17 will constitute an Event of Default under Section 16 of this Agreement.\n\n18. Miscellaneous\n\n18.1 Wherever possible, each provision hereof shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under Applicable Law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision or provisions shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without invalidating the remainder of such provision or provisions or any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction would be unreasonable.\n\n18.2 This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their successors and permitted assigns; provided, however, that the rights and obligations of any Party under this Agreement shall not be assignable by such Party without the prior written consent of the\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\nother Party pursuant to Section 8.1.
