That is, if the compensation committee (the \"Compensation Committee\") of the board of directors (the \"Board\") of the Company's parent company, Bicycle Therapeutics plc (\"BTL\") determines that you have completed all such corporate and personal objectives to its satisfaction in a given year, your bonus would be 35% of your Earned Salary in that year, excluding any other bonuses in this offer. Such bonus may be payable in cash or, in whole or in part, in share options in BTL, as agreed by you and the Compensation Committee following notification by you of your preference at least 90 days prior to the normal payment date (and in the case of share options with the appropriate HMRC valuation process (if required by the Compensation Committee) and Board approval so as to be compliant with BTL's share option plan rules), with due consideration for the operational requirements of the Company at that time in your role as CBO.\n\nAny Annual Performance Bonus paid will not be pensionable and are subject to statutory applicable tax and National Insurance deductions. Performance will be assessed by the Compensation Committee at the end of each calendar year, against annual corporate and personal performance objectives agreed between you and the Board at the start of each calendar year, with any such bonus being payable in the first quarter of the following year. Qualification for your Annual Performance Bonus will require that you are employed by the Company (and have not served notice of termination of your employment to the Company) on 31 December of the year to which your bonus entitlement applies.\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Equity Incentives\n\nBTL has established the Bicycle Therapeutics 2019 Share Option Plan (the \"Option Plan\").\n\nOn or as soon as practicable following the Effective Date, it is intended that you will be granted an option under the Option Plan to acquire 107,417 ordinary shares in the capital of BTL (\"Shares\") (representing approximately 0.6% of the Company's issued share capital as at the Effective Date).\n\nIn addition, and conditional on completion of a transaction on terms set out below, you will be granted a second option under the Option Plan, such option being one of:\n\n(a) an option to acquire 44,757 Shares (representing approximately 0.25% of the Company's issued share capital as at the Effective Date) granted as soon as practicable following the completion of a transaction approved by the Board on terms which include an upfront payment of at least USD30,000,000 and per product downstream milestone payments of at least USD300,000,000; or\n\n(b) an option to acquire 22,378 Shares (representing approximately 0.125% of the Company's issued share capital as at the Effective Date) granted as soon as practicable following the completion of a transaction approved by the Board on terms which include an upfront payment of USD24,000,000 and per product downstream milestone payments of USD240,000,000; or\n\n(c) an option to acquire such number of Shares (falling between 0.125% and 0.25% of the Company's issued share capital as at the Effective Date as the Board shall determine in its absolute discretion) granted as soon as practicable following completion of a transaction approved by the Board on terms which include an upfront payment greater than USD24,000,000 but less than USD 30,000,000, and per product downstream milestone payments greater than USD240,000,000 but less than USD 300,000,000.\n\nAny options granted under this paragraph 4.5 shall be subject to (i) the approval of the Board and/or the Compensation Committee; (ii) the rules of the Option Plan (as amended from time to time); and (iii) the terms of the option grant documentation which will be provided to you following such grant.\n\n5 BENEFITS\n\n5.1 The Company currently operates a personal pension plan provided by Scottish Widows Group. The Company will pay a sum equivalent to 12 % of your basic annual earned salary into a personal pension plan selected by the Company. You may make additional contributions if you wish, but this is not mandatory. In the event that you elect, of your own volition, to opt-out of the Company's pension scheme then the Company will pay you in equal monthly instalments in arrears (less statutory deductions) a sum equivalent to the contribution that it would have made into your pension scheme (the \"Cash Equivalent Payment\") less the Employer's National Insurance Contribution cost incurred by the Company as a result of making the Cash Equivalent Payment.\n\n5.2 The Company currently operates a private healthcare scheme and subject to acceptance by the insurer on reasonable terms, you will be entitled to join.\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 The Company operates a death in service scheme which you automatically join upon commencement of employment.\n\n5.4 Further details regarding benefits will be provided upon commencement of your employment. The Company reserves the right to replace or supplement any or all of the scheme(s) referred to in this paragraph 5, or to amend them at any time without compensation, provided that equivalent scheme(s) providing a similar level of benefit are put in place.\n\n6 EXPENSES\n\nThe Company shall reimburse all reasonable out of pocket expenses properly incurred by you in the performance of the duties under this Agreement including travelling, subsistence and entertainment expenses provided you follow the Company's guidelines/allowances in force at the relevant time and provided that you shall, where reasonably practicable, provide the Company with vouchers, invoices or such other evidence of such expenses as the Company may reasonably require.\n\n7 HOURS OF WORK\n\n7.1 Your normal working hours are Monday to Friday from 9.00 am to 5.30 pm on each working day with one hour for lunch. You will be required to work such other hours as shall be reasonably necessary for you to perform your duties for which no further remuneration is payable.\n\n7.2 By entering into this Agreement you confirm, that in your capacity as Chief Business Officer you may choose or determine the duration of your working time and the working time limits set out in part II of the Working Time Regulations 1998 do not apply to you.\n\n8 HOLIDAYS\n\n8.1 In addition to the usual public holidays you will be entitled to 25 working days paid holiday in each calendar year. The holiday will accrue on a pro rata basis throughout each calendar year.\n\n8.2 Holidays may only be taken at such time or times as are approved beforehand by the CEO, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. You must give reasonable notice of proposed holiday dates by e-mailing the CEO or delegated director in advance, for approval.\n\n8.3 The holiday year runs from January to December. With the agreement of the CEO, you may carry forward up to 5 days of untaken holiday into the next holiday year. Any carried over holiday must be taken by the end of March of the following calendar year or will be forfeited and no payment will be made in respect of any days so forfeited. You will not generally be permitted to take more than 10 days holiday at any one time.\n\n8.4 Upon termination of your employment you will receive pay in lieu of accrued but untaken holiday. The Company may deduct an appropriate sum in respect of days taken in excess of your pro rata entitlement from your final remuneration on the basis that one day's holiday will be calculated as 1/260ths of your basic annual salary.\n\n8.5 In the event that notice of termination of this Agreement is served by either party, the Company may require you to take any outstanding holiday during this notice period.\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n9 SICKNESS AND OTHER ABSENCE\n\n9.1 If you are unable to attend at work by reason of sickness or injury or any unauthorised reason you must inform the Company as soon as possible on the first day of absence (and in any event not later than 11.00 am on the first day of absence) and, in the case of absence of uncertain duration, you must keep the Company regularly informed of your continued absence and your likely date of return. You are expected to observe this rule very strictly since failure to do so will entitle the Company to stop payment in respect of each day you fail to notify the Company.\n\n9.2 If your absence, due to sickness or injury, is for less than seven (7) days, on your return to work you are required to immediately complete a self-certification form available from the Company. If your absence continues for more than seven (7) consecutive days (whether or not working days) you must provide the Company with a doctor's certificate from the seventh consecutive day of sickness or injury. This doctor's certificate must be provided to the Company promptly following the seventh consecutive day of absence. If illness continues after the expiry of the first certificate, further certificates must be provided promptly to cover the whole period of absence.\n\n9.3 Subject to your compliance with the Company's sickness absence procedures (as amended from time to time), the Company may in its sole and absolute discretion pay full salary and contractual benefits during any period of absence due to sickness or injury for up to an aggregate of 3 months in any fifty-two (52) week period (whether such absence is continuous or intermittent in any calendar year). Such payment shall be inclusive of any statutory sick pay due in accordance with applicable legislation in force at the time of absence. The Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, extend the period of allowance in an individual case if the circumstances so justify. Thereafter, the Company shall pay statutory sick pay or equivalent benefit to which you may be entitled subject to your compliance with the appropriate rules.\n\n9.4 Whether absent from work or not, you may be, but only on reasonable grounds, required to undergo a medical examination by a Company doctor and your consent will be sought for a report to be sent to the Company.\n\n9.5 The payment of sick pay in accordance with this paragraph 9 is without prejudice to the Company's right to terminate this Agreement prior to the expiry of your right to payments.\n\n9.6 In the event you are incapable of performing your duties by reason of injuries sustained wholly or partly as a result of a third party's actions all payments made to you by the Company as salary or sick pay shall to the extent that compensation is recoverable from that third party constitute loans to you and shall be due and owing when and to the extent that you recover compensation for loss of earnings from the third party.\n\n10 GARDEN LEAVE\n\n10.1 After notice of termination has been given by you or the Company, the Company may at its discretion require you, for all or part of your notice period, to comply with any or all of the following instructions:\n\n(a) not to carry out any further work for the Company or for any Group Company;\n\n(b) to remain away from the Company's business premises and those of any Group\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany (unless given written permission to do otherwise);\n\n(c) not to contact any of the Company's clients, suppliers or employees or those of any Group Company without the Company's prior written permission;\n\n(d) to carry out only part of your duties, or to carry out alternative duties or special projects for the Company within your skill set;\n\n(e) to co-operate in the handover of your duties and responsibilities;\n\n(f) to resign from any offices (including as a director) you hold within the Company or any Group Company or by virtue of your employment with us;\n\n(g) to answer, in an honest and helpful way, such questions as the Company may reasonably ask of you;\n\n(h) to keep the Company informed of your whereabouts and contact details and to remain reasonably contactable and available for work.\n\n10.2 During any such period as described in paragraph 10.1 (\"Garden Leave\") the Company may appoint another person to carry out some or all of your duties. You will continue to owe all other duties and obligations (whether express or implied including fidelity and good faith) during Garden Leave and you shall continue to receive full pay and benefits (except that you will not accrue any further entitlement to any cash or equity incentive awards or bonus payments in respect of the Garden Leave period).\n\n10.3 By placing you on Garden Leave, the Company will not be in breach of this Agreement or any implied duty of any kind whatsoever nor will you have any claim against the Company in respect of any such action.\n\n10.4 During any period of Garden Leave you will remain readily contactable and available for work save when on paid holiday taken in accordance with paragraph 8. In the event that you are not available for work having been requested by the Company to do so, you will, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, forfeit any right to salary and contractual benefits.\n\n10.5 During any period of Garden Leave the Company may require you to deliver up any Confidential Information or property of the Company or any Group Company and upon instruction, delete any emails, spreadsheets or other Confidential Information and you will confirm your compliance with this paragraph 10.5 in writing if requested to do so by the Company.\n\n10.6 During any period of Garden Leave the Company may require you to take any outstanding holiday entitlement.\n\n11 NOTICE\n\n11.1 Without prejudice to the Company's right to summarily terminate your employment in accordance with paragraph 11.3 below and your right to summarily terminate your employment for Good Reason in accordance with paragraph 11.4 below, either you or the Company may terminate your employment by giving to the other not less than six months' notice in writing.\n\n11.2 The Company reserves the right in its sole and absolute discretion to give written notice to\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\nterminate your employment forthwith and to make a payment to you in lieu of salary and the benefits set out in paragraph 5 of this Agreement for all or any unexpired part of the notice period. For the avoidance of doubt, any payment in lieu made pursuant to this paragraph 11.2 will not include any element in relation to any payment in respect of (i) any Annual Performance Bonus or (ii) any holiday entitlement that would have otherwise accrued during the period for which the payment in lieu is made. For the further avoidance of doubt, if the Company elects to make a Payment in Lieu after notice of termination has been given by you, this will not constitute a termination by the Company without Cause for the purposes of paragraphs 11.7 and 11.8 below.\n\n11.3 The Company may summarily terminate your employment hereunder (without notice) for Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, \"Cause\" shall mean where you:\n\n(a) commit gross misconduct which includes, but is not limited to, dishonesty, fraud, theft, being under the influence of alcohol or drugs at work, causing actual or threatening physical harm and causing damage to Company property;\n\n(b) commit a material breach or non-observance of your duties or any of the provisions of this Agreement, or materially fail to observe the lawful directions of the Company, or breach any material Company policy or code of conduct, including but not limited to the Company's policy from time to time on matters relating to harassment;\n\n(c) are convicted of a criminal offence (other than an offence under the road traffic legislation in the United Kingdom or elsewhere for which a non-custodial sentence is imposed);\n\n(d) act in a manner which in the reasonable opinion of the Company, brings the Company into disrepute or otherwise prejudices or is in the reasonable opinion of the Company considered likely to prejudice the reputation of the Company;\n\n(e) in the reasonable opinion of the Company, are guilty of any serious negligence in connection with or affecting the business or affairs of the Company;\n\n(f) are unfit to carry out the duties hereunder because of sickness, injury or otherwise for an aggregate period of 26 weeks in any fifty-two (52) week period even if, as a result of such termination, you would or might forfeit any entitlement to benefit from sick pay under paragraph 9.3 above.\n\nAny delay or forbearance by the Company in exercising any right of termination in accordance with this paragraph 11.3 will not constitute a waiver of such right.\n\n11.4 You may summarily terminate your employment hereunder at any time (without notice) for Good Reason after complying with the Good Reason Process. For purposes of this Agreement, \"Good Reason\" shall mean that you have complied with the \"Good Reason Process\" (hereinafter defined) following the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) a material diminution in your responsibilities, authority or duties; (ii) a material diminution in your Salary; (iii) a material change in the geographic location at which you provides services to the Company; or (iv) the material breach of this Agreement by the Company. \"Good Reason Process\" shall mean that (i) you reasonably determine in good faith that a \"Good Reason\" condition has occurred; (ii) you notify the Company in writing of the first occurrence of the Good\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\nReason condition within 60 days of the first occurrence of such condition; (iii) you cooperate in good faith with the Company's efforts, for a period not less than 30 days following such notice (the \"Cure Period\"), to remedy the condition; (iv) notwithstanding such efforts, the Good Reason condition continues to exist; and (v) you terminate your employment (without notice) within 60 days after the end of the Cure Period. If the Company cures the Good Reason condition during the Cure Period, Good Reason shall be deemed not to have occurred.\n\n11.5 Your employment hereunder shall also terminate immediately upon your death.\n\n11.6 If your employment with the Company is terminated for any reason, the Company shall pay or provide to you (or to your authorised representative or estate) (i) any Salary earned through the Termination Date (as defined below); (ii) unpaid expense reimbursements (subject to, and in accordance with, paragraph 6 of this Agreement); and (iii) any vested benefits you may have under any employee benefit plan of the Company through the Termination Date, which vested benefits shall be paid and/or provided in accordance with the terms of such employee benefit plans (collectively, the \"Accrued Benefits\").\n\nSeverance Pay and Benefits Upon Termination by the Company without Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason outside the Change in Control Period.\n\n11.7 If your employment is terminated on account of your death or by the Company without Cause (being for any reason not covered by paragraph 11.3), or you terminate your employment for Good Reason (as provided in paragraph 11.4), in either case outside of the Change in Control Period, then the Company shall pay you the Accrued Benefits. In addition, subject to (i) your (or your authorised representative or estate signing, if the termination is due to your death) signing a settlement agreement and a separation agreement and release (together the \"Settlement Agreements\") in a form and manner satisfactory to the Company, which shall include, without limitation, a general release of claims against the Company and all related persons and entities, a reaffirmation of all of your continuing obligations to the Company, including those set forth in paragraphs 13 - 15, and (in the case of the separation agreement and release) and a seven (7) business day revocation period; and (ii) the separation agreement and release becoming irrevocable, all within 60 days after the Termination Date (or such shorter period as set forth in the Settlement Agreements), the Company shall: (A) pay you (or your authorised representative or estate if the termination is due to your death) an amount equal to nine (9) months of your salary as of the Termination Date (which payment shall not be reduced by either the value of any salary paid to you during your notice period or by any payment in lieu of notice made pursuant to paragraph 11.2); and (B) pay you (or your authorised representative or estate if the termination is due to your death) an amount equal to the cost to the Company of providing you with the contractual benefits under paragraph 5 for nine (9) months or, at the Company's option, continue to provide you with such benefits for nine (9) months.\n\nSeverance Pay and Benefits Upon Termination by the Company without Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason Within the Change in Control Period\n\n11.8 The provisions of this paragraph 11.8 shall apply in lieu of, and expressly supersede, the provisions of paragraph 11.7 regarding severance pay and benefits upon a termination by the Company without Cause or by you for Good Reason if such termination of employment occurs within 12 months after the occurrence of the first event constituting a Change in Control (such period, the \"Change in Control Period\"). These provisions shall terminate and be of no further\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\nforce or effect after the Change in Control Period.\n\n(a) Change in Control Period. If during the Change in Control Period your employment is terminated on account of your death or by the Company without Cause (being for any reason not covered by paragraph 11.3) or you terminate your employment for Good Reason (as provided in paragraph 11.4), then, subject to (i) your signing (or your authorised representative or estate signing, if the termination is due to your death) a settlement agreement and a separation agreement and release (together the Settlement Agreements) in a form and manner satisfactory to the Company, which shall include, without limitation, a general release of claims against the Company and all related persons and entities, a reaffirmation of all of your continuing obligations to the Company, including those set forth in paragraphs 13 - 15, and (in the case of the separation agreement and release) and a seven (7) business day revocation period; and (ii) the separation agreement and release becoming irrevocable, all within 60 days after the Termination Date (or such shorter period as set forth in the Settlement Agreements):\n\n(i) the Company shall pay you (or your authorised representative or estate if the termination is due to your death) an amount equal to the sum of (A) your annual salary as of the Termination Date (or your annual salary in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control, if higher) plus (B) your target annual performance bonus amount under the Annual Bonus Plan for the then-current year (the \"Change in Control Payment\"), which payment shall not be reduced by either the value of any salary paid to you during your notice period or by the value of any payment made to you in lieu of notice pursuant to paragraph 11.2;\n\n(ii) the Company shall: pay you (or your authorised representative or estate if the termination is due to your death) an amount equal to the cost to the Company of providing you with the contractual benefits under paragraph 5 for twelve (12) months or, at the Company's option, continue to provide you with such benefits for twelve (12) months; and\n\n(iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any applicable option agreement or other stock-based award agreement, all Time-Based Equity Awards shall immediately accelerate and become fully exercisable (for a period determined in accordance with the rules of the applicable equity plan) or nonforfeitable as of the later of (A) the Termination Date or (B) the Accelerated Vesting Date; provided that any termination or forfeiture of the unvested portion of such Time-Based Equity Awards that would otherwise occur on the Termination Date in the absence of this Agreement will be delayed until the Effective Date of the Settlement Agreements and will only occur if the vesting pursuant to this subsection does not occur due to the absence of the Settlement Agreements becoming fully effective within the time period set forth therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no additional vesting of the Time-Based Equity Awards shall occur during the period between your Termination Date and the Accelerated Vesting Date.\n\n11.9 Definitions.

Key elements include the following:\n\n(a) You must ensure that laptops, memory sticks, phones and other mobile devices are password protected and encrypted. You must not take such devices outside the office without encryption.

Depending on context, you may then need to provide further information on the circumstances of the breach.\n\n18.6 A data breach occurs where there is destruction, loss, alteration or unauthorised disclosure of or access to personal data which is being held, stored, transmitted or processed in any way. For example, there is a data breach if our servers are hacked or if you lose a laptop or USB stick or send an email to the wrong person by mistake.\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n18.7 Failure to notify a breach or to provide information as set out above will be treated seriously and disciplinary action may be taken.\n\nWhy we process personal data\n\n18.8 For information on the nature of the data we process, why we process it, the legal basis for processing and related matters, please refer to our Privacy Notice.

We do not, in general, rely on your consent as a legal basis for processing. Agreeing the terms of this Agreement will not constitute your giving consent to our processing of your data.\n\n18.10 We reserve the right to amend the documents referred to above from time to time.\n\n19 THIRD PARTY RIGHTS\n\nSave in respect of any rights conferred by this Agreement on any Group Company (which such Group Company shall be entitled to enforce), a person who is not a party to this Agreement may not under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 enforce any of the terms contained within this Agreement.\n\n20 DEFINITIONS\n\nIn this Agreement:\n\n\"Group Company\" means a subsidiary or affiliate and any other company which is for the time being a holding company of the Company or another subsidiary or affiliate of any such holding company as defined by the Companies Act 2006 (as amended) and \"Group Companies\" will be interpreted accordingly.\n\n21 ENTIRE AGREEMENT\n\nThese terms and conditions constitute the entire agreement between the parties and supersede any other agreement whether written or oral previously entered into.\n\n22 JURISDICTION AND CHOICE OF LAW\n\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of England and Wales and the parties to this Agreement submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of England and Wales in relation to any claim, dispute or matter arising out of or relating to this Agreement.\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n23 NOTICES\n\nAny notices with respect to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally (upon receipt), sent by email or sent by first class post addressed, in the case of the Company, to the Company Secretary at its registered office and in your case, addressed to your address last known to the Company.\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\nSchedule\n\nDefinitions\n\nChange in Control: means and includes each of the following:\n\n(a) a Sale;

USE OF SEGMENT T   11.1 The Terminal Parties hereby grant to the Parties accessing APCN 2 at their respective terminal station, the right of use in the relevant Segment T (hereinafter referred to as \"Terminal Station Right of Use\") on the terms and conditions stated in this Paragraph 11, to the extent required for the use of its Allocated Capacity, for the purpose of using APCN 2 and carrying on the related activities at that location in accordance with this Agreement. This Terminal Station Right of Use shall commence on the RFS Date and shall continue for the duration of this Agreement.   11.2 In the event that an agreement for another cable system utilizing any Terminal Station of the APCN 2 is terminated prior to the termination of this Agreement, the owner of the respective Segment T, with the agreement of the Parties hereto, shall take all necessary   23\n\n\n\n\n\n  measures to ensure that the Terminal Station in question will be available for the APCN 2 for the duration of this Agreement on fair and equitable terms. If the Terminal Station in question is not available for the landing and terminating of the APCN 2 for any reason, the owner of the Terminal Station shall provide reasonable advance notice to all Parties and such owner, in agreement with the Parties hereto, shall take all necessary measures to ensure that another appropriate Terminal Station will be available for the APCN 2 for the duration of this Agreement on terms and conditions similar to those contained in this Agreement. Applicable costs to the Parties will be determined by the Management Committee.   11.3 For each Terminal Station Right of Use, the Parties hereto shall not be required to pay any additional charges over and above the Capital Costs and O&M costs.   11.4 Notwithstanding Subparagraph 11.1 of this Agreement, a Party thereby granted a Terminal Station Right of Use interest in Segment T may, prior to the commencement of that Terminal Station Right of Use interest, elect to renounce its Terminal Station Right of Use entitlement and to instead have use of any Segment T for the duration of this Agreement on such terms and conditions as are agreed between that Party and the relevant Terminal Party, and in such event the provisions of Subparagraphs 11.1 of this Agreement shall apply in relation to such use except insofar as they may be modified by such agreements. This Subparagraph 11.4 shall not operate to confer on a Party any financial or other benefit of substance to which that Party would not otherwise be entitled under this Agreement.   11.5 The Terminal Parties agree to grant a Terminal Station Right of Use to APCN 2 IRU purchasers.   11.6 In the event of a sale or other disposition of Segment T1, T2,T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9 and T10, or part thereof prior to the termination of this Agreement, the owner shall share with the other Parties hereto any net proceeds, or costs, of such sale or disposition received, or expended, by the owner, to the extent allocable to the Capital Costs, in the proportions set forth in Schedule B.   12. ACQUISITION AND USE OF CAPACITY   12.1 Capacity of APCN 2 can only be used by a carrier.   12.2 Parties shall obtain Allocated Capacity in the form of MIU on an ownership basis as shown in Schedule C, in return for their financial investment as identified in Schedule B.   12.3 Procedures for Parties activation of their Allocated Capacity will be developed by the AR&RSC and the NA for Management Committee approval.   24\n\n\n\n\n\n  ASSIGNMENT OF CAPACITY   12.4 For each MIU of its Allocated Capacity, a Party is allowed to assign two (2) half STM-l circuits on any Path within the APCN 2. All such circuits are ring-protected. Additional ring-protected half STM-1 circuits may be granted proportionately to a Party's Allocated Capacity as shown in Schedule C at the discretion of the Management Committee according to the recommendation of the AR&RSC and the NA.   12.5 The Parties may designate a portion of their Allocated Capacity in specific Paths of the APCN 2 as:   (i) Jointly Assigned Circuit (hereinafter referred to as \"JAC\") which shall be considered as consisting of two half STM-I circuits, with one half STM-1 circuit assigned to a Party, which together with the corresponding half STM-1 circuit, shall be used for the provision of international telecommunications services between such a Party and another Carrier that has received the right of use pursuant to this Paragraph 12 or an APCN 2 IRU purchaser. Any alteration to the JAC is subject to bilateral agreement between both Carriers.   (ii) Wholly Assigned Circuit (hereinafter referred to as \"WAC\") which shall be considered as consisting of two half STM-1 circuits assigned to one Party.   USE OF WHOLLY ASSIGNED CIRCUIT   12.6 A Party is allowed to use its WAC for the provision of international telecommunications services with itself, its Subsidiary, its Parent Company and/or the Subsidiary of the Party's Parent Company provided that the correspondent parties are also Carriers.   12.7 A Party is also allowed to use its WAC to interconnect with other communication systems for the provision of international telecommunications services terminating outside the APCN 2 landing Countries. If such WAC is originated from any APCN 2 landing Country, such Party must be a Carrier of that Country.   12.8 A Party is also allowed to use its WAC for the provision of international telecommunications services with its Affiliate and/or the Affiliate of the Party's Parent Company provided that this Affiliate is a Carrier and a cash contribution is made by the Party to a special fund dedicated solely to fund future upgrades to increase the Equipped Capacity. The amount of the contribution is described in Annex 7.   PORTABILITY OF CAPACITY   12.9 A Party is allowed to de-assign its JAC and/or WAC to its Allocated Capacity provided that bilateral agreement is given by the concerned Camera and according to the guidelines to be developed by the AR&RSC and the NA.   12.10 Re-assignment of Allocated Capacity which resulted from the de-assignment of the JAC and/or WAC shall give priority to the assignment of Allocated Capacity which has not   25\n\n\n\n\n\n  been de-assigned before, in the event that there is any conflicting requirement for use of capacity on the APCN 2.   12.11 Under no circumstances shall a Party's JAC and/or WAC be de-activated due to the assignment of other Parties' Allocated Capacity.   TRANSFER OF CAPACITY   12.12 For the purpose of this Agreement, Transfer of capacity (hereinafter called \"Transfer\") is the making available of all the right of use of the capacity being made available that is accorded to a Party by this Agreement to a third party without transferring the Party's other obligations and rights including the right of Transfer.   12.13 Transfer of a Party's Allocated Capacity to its Subsidiary or its Parent Company or the Subsidiary of the Party's Parent Company is allowed provided that the capacity transferred is in multiples of the MIU and that the recipient of the transferred capacity is a Carrier.   12.14 Transfer of a Party's Allocated Capacity to its Affiliate and/or the Affiliate of the Party's Parent Company is also allowed provided that the capacity transferred is in multiples of the MIU and that the recipient of the transferred capacity is a Carrier. For the Transfer to an Affiliate, the transferring party shall make a cash contribution to a special fund dedicated solely to fund future upgrades to increase the Equipped Capacity. The amount of the contribution is described in Annex 7.   12.15 The conditions applicable to the use and Transfer of capacity as specified in Annex 7 shall be relaxed after the Equipped Capacity is expanded to four (4) times of Initial Equipped Capacity or two (2) years after the RFS date whichever comes first unless an earlier date is approved by the Management Committee. Any relaxations on these conditions shall be approved by a vote of the members of the Management Committee representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the total voting interests as specified in Schedule B.   12.16 The Unallocated Capacity in the APCN 2 shall be owned by the Parties in common and undivided shares in accordance with the percentages in Schedule C.   12.17 IRU Capacity will be sold at the MJU level. Such IRU Capacity will be sold from the Unallocated Capacity. Proceeds from the sale of such IRU Capacity shall be used to fund the Expansion of the APCN 2 Equipped Capacity.   12.18 A Party or IRU purchaser may use its MIU with itself, another Party, or IRU purchaser to form matched circuits.   12.19 The distribution of capacity from the initial Unallocated Capacity shall be made no later than three (3) years from the RFS date on a pro rata basis, in MIUs, in accordance with the percentages in Schedule C. The exact time to implement such distribution of capacity   26\n\n\n\n\n\n  shall be decided by a vote of members of the Management Committee representing at least two-thirds (66.67%) of the total voting interests as specified in Schedule B.   12.20 Once the Equipped Capacity is expanded to six (6) times of Initial Equipped Capacity or three (3) years after the RFS date whichever comes first unless an earlier date is approved by the Management Committee, any Party is entitled to sell IRU to other Carriers from its Allocated Capacity on a private basis without any restrictions except that the IRU shall be for the life of APCN 2. The terms and conditions including pricing of such private IRU sales are bilateral matters between granting Party and purchaser.   12.21 When Unallocated Capacity is depleted, and during the period until the availability of additional Unallocated Capacity, a Party may be allowed to sell IRU to other Carriers from its Allocated Capacity privately subject to the Management Committee's approval on a case by case basis. The terms and conditions including pricing of such private IRU sales are bilateral matters between granting Party and purchaser.   12.22 Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Paragraph 12, when the Equipped Capacity is expanded to six (6) times of Initial Equipped Capacity or three (3) years after the RFS date whichever comes first, any Party is entitled to make available any of its Allocated Capacity for use by other Carriers on any commercial basis without any restrictions.   12.23 Guidelines for use of the IRU Capacity and Terms and Conditions of the IRU agreement shall be developed by the I&ASC and approved by a vote of members of the Management Committee representing at least two-thirds (66.67%) of the total voting interests as specified in Schedule B. The NA shall be authorized to execute IRU agreements for one or more whole MIUs with APCN 2 IRU Capacity purchasers on behalf of the Parties to this Agreement. No provisions of the IRU agreement shall override the provisions of this Agreement.   12.24 Schedules B, C, and D shall be modified by the NA, as appropriate, to reflect any revised ownership of capacity or sales of IRU Capacity pursuant to this Paragraph 12.   12.25 The Management Committee may authorize use of the Unallocated Capacity for restoration of telecommunications services and other purposes. The terms and conditions of such use shall be determined by the Management Committee based, in part, on terms to be agreed to by the relevant Terminal Parties of the APCN 2, in recognition of the technical and operational impact on the Terminal Station operations. Parties will receive revenues in accordance with Schedule C.   12.26 The communications capability of any capacity may be optimized by the Parties to whom such capacity is allocated by the use of equipment which will more efficiently use such capacity provided that the use of such equipment does not cause an interruption of, or interference, impairment, or degradation to, the use of any other capacity in the APCN 2 or prevent the use of similar equipment by other Parties. A Party to whom capacity is allocated shall permit the use of such equipment by a Carrier to which such Party has   27\n\n\n\n\n\n  made available the use of any such capacity, provided that such Carrier agrees that its use of the equipment will satisfy the conditions set forth in this Subparagraph 12.26.   12.27 A Party may sell capacity in fascicles smaller than a STM-1 in the APCN 2 at any time on any basis other than by transfer of ownership. The APCN 2 shall not be responsible for aggregating such capacity to the STM-1 level.   13. EXPANSION OF EQUIPPED CAPACITY   13.1 Any upgrade of Equipped Capacity of APCN 2, including any costs, financial adjustments and allocation of capacity associated with such upgrade, shall be approved by vote of members of the Management Committee representing at least two-thirds (66.67%) of the total voting interests as specified in Schedule B.   13.2 All Parties shall have the might to a pro-rata share of the upgrade capacity in accordance with Schedule C. However, no Party shall be forced to participate in such an upgrade. Parties not   14. INCREASE OR DECREASE OF DESIGN CAPACITY   14.1 In the event that the Initial Parties consider that it is beneficial to increase the Design Capacity of APCN 2, a Design Capacity expansion, including any costs, financial adjustments and allocation of capacity associated with such upgrade, shall be decided by the Management Committee representing at least two-thirds (66.67%) of the total voting interests as specified in Schedule B. However, no Party shall be forced to participate in such an upgrade, in the event that incremental funding is required to execute such an upgrade. Schedules B and C shall be appropriately modified to reflect the revisions associated with such increase of Design Capacity.   14.2 In the event that the capacity which APCN 2 or any Segment thereof is capable of providing is reduced below the capacity required to support the Allocated Capacity on its existing or planned routings as a result of physical deterioration, or for other reasons beyond the control of the Parties, the Management Committee shall initiate a review of the capacity routings, in order to support the rerouting of such Allocated Capacity.   14.3 In the event that the capacity which APCN 2 or any Segment thereof is capable of providing is lower than the capacity needed to support the routing of circuits assigned in APCN 2, the Allocated Capacity of the Parties may be reduced or changed as necessary and agreed by the Parties affected, and financial adjustments shall be made among the Parties, as necessary, on the terms and conditions to be agreed by the Management Committee. The Schedules shall be modified, as appropriate, to reflect the revised Allocated Capacity associated with such decrease of the Design Capacity.   28\n\n\n\n\n\n  15. OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE TRANSITING FACILITIES TO EXTEND APCN2 CAPACITY TO EXTEND APCN 2 CAPACITY   15.1 The Terminal Parties shall use all reasonable efforts to provide and maintain or cause to be provided and maintained in working order for the duration of this Agreement, the necessary transit facilities within their respective Countries as may be reasonably required for extending capacity in the APCN 2 so as to provide connections to the other international cables' transmission facilities.   15.2 The facilities provided pursuant to Subparagraph 15.1 shall be suitable for extending capacity in the APCN 2 of all payload types as defined in Subparagraph 15.3 and shall be furnished and maintained on terms and conditions which shall be no less favorable than those granted to another Carrier for transmission facilities of similar type and quantity transiting the location involved. Such terms and conditions shall not be inconsistent with applicable governmental regulations in the Countries in which the facilities are located.   15.3 As required the Terminal Parties shall support payloads of STM-l, STM-4, STM-l6 and STM-64.   16. OBLIGATION TO CONNECT THE APCN 2 WITH INLAND SYSTEMS   16.1 The Parties shall, at their own expense, on or before the RFS Date, do or cause to be done, all such acts and things as may be necessary within its operating Country to provide and maintain throughout the period of this Agreement suitable connection of capacity from APCN 2 with appropriate inland communications facilities in its operating Country.   16.2 The Terminal Parties will provide connection to APCN 2 to other Carriers within their Countries on terms and conditions negotiated and agreed by the parties concerned.   17.

In such circumstances, the Schedules shall be revised to reflect the default of a Party and the reallocation of interests pursuant to the arrangements determined by the Management Committee.   23.3 Notwithstanding Subparagraph 23.2, reclamation of a Terminal Party's capacity will not release the Terminal Party from providing, operating and maintaining its respective Terminal Station until a reasonable agreement is negotiated in order to ensure the continuous operation of the said Terminal Party's Terminal Station after reclamation of its capacity.   24. WAIVER   The failure of any Party, on one or more occasions, to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any right or privilege hereunder shall not thereafter be   34\n\n\n\n\n\n  construed as a waiver of any breach or default, or as a waiver of any such provision, right, or privilege hereunder.   25. COMPLIANCE WITH LAW   In the performance of their obligations hereunder, the Parties agree to comply with all applicable laws of all Countries having jurisdiction over the activities performed under or stipulated by this Agreement.   26.

RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES   27.1 If a dispute should arise under this Agreement between or among the Parties they shall make every reasonable effort to resolve such dispute. However, in the event that they are unable to resolve such dispute, the matter shall be referred to the Management Committee which shall either resolve the matter or determine the method, such as arbitration, by which the matter should be resolved. This procedure shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any dispute which may arise under this Agreement between or among the Parties. The performance of this Agreement by the Parties shall continue during the resolution of any dispute.   27.2 If any difference shall arise between or among the Parties or any of them in respect of the interpretation or effect of this Agreement or any part or provision thereof or their rights and obligations thereunder, and by reasons thereof there shall arise the need to decide the question by what municipal or national law this Agreement or any part or provision thereof is governed, the following facts shall be excluded from consideration, namely that this Agreement was made in a particular country and that it may appear by reason of its form, style, language or otherwise to have been drawn preponderantly with reference to a particular system of municipal or national law; the intention of the Parties being that such facts shall be regarded by the Parties and in all courts and tribunals wherever situated as irrelevant to the question aforesaid and to the decision thereof.   28.

Customer agrees, as reasonably requested by eGain, to provide eGain with access to Customer's premises and equipment and to otherwise cooperate with eGain in performing the services. During the term of this Agreement, Customer may obtain information (\"Reports\") regarding Customer's use of the Software and the quantity and handling of Online Messages routed to the eGain System by accessing the eGain System through a password-protected Web site made available by eGain. Customer shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of such passwords and shall permit only authorized employees of Customer to access the eGain System. The Hosting Services, and the hosting fees specified in Exhibit A, do not include any deployment, training or other consulting or professional services which, if applicable, will be specified in a Statement of Work, signed by both parties, and incorporated herein by this reference.\n\n2.1 Customer Support. eGain will provide live telephone support to Customer 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week by a trained eGain customer support representative.\n\n3. Customer's Responsibilities. Customer agrees that it shall be responsible for providing and maintaining its own Internet access and all necessary telecommunications equipment, software and other materials (\"Customer Equipment\") at Customer's location necessary for accessing the Software and the eGain System through the Internet. Customer agrees to notify eGain of any changes in the Customer Equipment, including any system configuration changes or any hardware or software upgrades, which may affect the Hosting Services provided hereunder.

Customer agrees not to transmit, re-transmit or store materials on or through the eGain System or the Software that are harmful to the eGain System or Software, or in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, including without limitation laws relating to infringement of intellectual property and proprietary rights of others. To the extent that certain components of the Software may be downloaded to Customer's or User's computer as a result of accessing the Software as part of the Hosting Services, eGain grants Customers a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license, with right to sublicense solely to Users, to use such Software only in connection with the Hosting Services. Neither Customer nor Users are otherwise permitted to use the Software, nor will Customer or Users disassemble, decompile or otherwise attempt to discern the source code of such Software. Customer agrees that, except as expressly set forth in this Section and in Section 11, it will not rent, lease, sublicense, re-sell, time-share or otherwise assign to any third party this Agreement or any of Customer's rights or licenses to access the Software or the eGain System, nor shall Customer use, or authorize others to use, the Software, Hosting Services or the eGain System to operate a service bureau. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Customer shall be permitted to provide access to the eGain System to its employees and agents located worldwide.\n\n4. Proprietary Rights. Except for the limited access right granted to Customer in this Agreement, all right, title and interest in and to the Software (including any and all modifications as a result of any implementation services rendered) and the eGain System are and shall remain the exclusive property of eGain and its licensors. eGain acknowledges and agrees that the Online Messages are the property of Customer and that eGain has only a limited right to use the Online Messages as set forth in the following sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, eGain may access and disclose the Online Messages solely as necessary to provide the Hosting Services, to operate and maintain its systems, to comply with applicable laws and government orders and requests, and to protect itself and its customers.\n\n5. Pricing and Payment. Customer agrees to pay the fees and other charges for the Hosting Services and other services provided under this Agreement as specified in Exhibit A of this Agreement. CUSTOMER AGREES TO PAY FOR HOSTING SERVICES ON OR BEFORE THE FIRST DAY OF THE MONTH IN WHICH THE HOSTING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED, except that, with respect to Additional Fees (as defined in Exhibit A), eGain will invoice Customer for such Fees in the month after the month in which such fees accrue as provided in Exhibit A. All amounts payable hereunder are exclusive of any and all taxes, and Customer is responsible for payment of such taxes (excluding taxes based on eGain's net income). All prices are stated, and Customer shall pay, in United States dollars. Payment received by eGain after the due date shall be subject to a late fee equal to one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or, if less, the maximum amount allowed by applicable law. At the end of the initial one-year term of this Agreement and any subsequent one-year terms, eGain may adjust the monthly fee payable under this Agreement by providing Customer written notice of such adjustment at least sixty (60) days prior to the beginning of the new term.\n\n6. Limited Warranties; Disclaimer of Warranties.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1 eGain warrants and represents to Customer that (i) the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the documentation, if any, provided by eGain to Customer, and (ii) the Hosting Services will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner and in accordance with Section 2. In the event of Downtime (as defined in this Section 6.1 below), as Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and eGain's sole and exclusive liability, the monthly fee payable for the Hosting Services shall be reduced as follows:\n\na) For the first sixty (60) minutes of Downtime during Normal Business       Hours or the first four (4) hours of Downtime outside of Normal Business       Hours (\"Initial Downtime\"), eGain will credit Customer's account for one       (1) day of service.\n\nb) For each eight (8) hour period of Downtime per day in addition to the       Initial Downtime, eGain will credit Customer's account for one (1)       additional day of service.\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, \"Downtime\" shall mean any interruption in the availability of Hosting Services to Customer (excluding scheduled interruptions of which Customer is notified 48 hours in advanced), only if such interruption is due either to: 1) an error in the Software, or 2) failure of the eGain System (but not including problems associated with Internet connectivity). Downtime begins upon Customer notification to eGain of the interruption, either\n\neGAIN COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION\n\nHOSTING AGREEMENT\n\nby speaking directly with an eGain customer service representative or recording a voice mail message in the eGain customer service voice mail box, and continues until the availability of the Hosting Services is restored to the Customer. For purposes of this Agreement, \"Normal Business Hours\" shall mean between the hours of 6:00 a.m to 6:00 p.m. Pacific time, Monday through Friday excluding national holidays.\n\nIn the event of a breach (other than Downtime) of the warranty set forth in Section 6.1(i) above, Customer's sole and exclusive remedy, and eGain's sole and exclusive liability shall be, at eGain's option, repair or replacement of the Software.\n\nTHE FOREGOING CONSTITUTES CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, AND eGAIN'S ENTIRE LIABILITY, FOR DOWNTIME AND FOR BREACH OF THE HOSTING SERVICES WARRANTY PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION 6.1.\n\n6.2 eGain represents and warrants that, prior to, during and after the calendar year 2000 A.D., the Software and the eGain System will process, calculate, manipulate, sort, store and transfer date data without material error or material performance degradation, including without limitation date data which represents or references different centuries or more than one century (such representation and warranty being referred to as \"Year 2000 Compliant\"). In the event that the Software or eGain System is not Year 2000 Compliant, Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and eGain's sole and exclusive liability shall be for eGain, at no additional cost to Customer, to promptly modify the Software or the eGain System so that the Software or eGain System is Year 2000 Compliant. The foregoing warranty is conditioned upon the Customer using the Software and/or the eGain System in accordance with its applicable Documentation, and on other software, hardware, network and systems (other than the Software and the eGain System) with which the Software and/or the eGain System interface or interoperate also being Year 2000 Compliant.\n\n6.3 EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTIONS 6.1-6.2, (A) THE HOSTING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED, AND THE SOFTWARE AND THE eGAIN SYSTEM ARE MADE AVAILABLE, BY eGAIN TO CUSTOMER \"AS IS,\" AND (B) eGAIN AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THE HOSTING SERVICES, THE SOFTWARE OR THE eGAIN SYSTEM, AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND AGAINST INFRINGEMENT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE BY LAW.\n\n6.4 Without limiting the express warranties set forth in this Agreement, eGain does not warrant that the Software, the eGain System or the Hosting Services will meet Customer's requirements (except as provided in Section 6.1) or that Customer's access to and use of the Software, the eGain System or the Hosting Services will be uninterrupted or free of errors or omissions. eGain cannot and does not guarantee the privacy, security, authenticity and non-corruption of any information transmitted through, or stored in any system connected to, the Internet. eGain will use commercially reasonable efforts to adequately maintain, and upgrade as necessary, the eGain System to provide the Hosting Services to its customers. However, except as expressly set forth herein, eGain shall not be responsible for any delays, errors, failures to perform, or disruptions in the Hosting Services caused by or resulting from any act, omission or condition beyond eGain's reasonable control.\n\n7. Limitation of liability. EXCLUDING LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AS DISCUSSED IN SECTION 9 OF THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL eGAIN BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS), OR BE LIABLE TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, EVEN IF eGAIN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. eGain's entire liability under this Agreement for any damages from any cause whatsoever, regardless of form or action, whether in contract, negligence or otherwise, shall in no event exceed an amount equal to the price paid for the Services out of which the claim arose.\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Confidential Information. Each party agrees to keep confidential and to use only for purposes of performing (or as otherwise permitted under) this Agreement, any proprietary or confidential information of the other party disclosed pursuant to this Agreement which is marked as confidential or which would reasonably be considered of a confidential nature. The obligation of confidentiality shall not apply to information which is publicly available through authorized disclosure, is known by the receiving party at the time of disclosure as evidenced in writing, is rightfully obtained from a third party who has the right to disclose it, or which is required by law, government order or request to be disclosed. Upon any termination of this Agreement, each party shall return to the other party all confidential information of the other party, and all copies thereof, in the possession, custody or control of the party unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement.\n\n9. Indemnification. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 9, eGain will defend any third-party suit or action against Customer to the extent such suit or action is based on a claim that the Software or the eGain System infringes any valid United States patent, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right, and eGain will pay those damages and costs finally awarded against Customer in any monetary settlement of such suit or action which are specifically attributable to such claim. These obligations do not include any claims to the extent they are based on use of the Software or eGain System in violation of this Agreement or in combination with any other software or hardware, or any modification to the Software or eGain System pursuant to Customer's specifications. If any portion of the Software or eGain System becomes, or in eGain's opinion is likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement, then eGain may, at its option and expense, (a) procure for Customer the right to continue using such Software or the eGain System, or (b) replace or modify the Software or the eGain System so that it becomes non-infringing. The indemnity obligations set forth in this Section 9 are contingent upon: (i) Customer giving prompt written notice to the eGain of any such claim(s); (ii) eGain having sole control of the defense or settlement of the claim; and (iii) at eGain's request and expense, Customer cooperating in the investigation and defense of such claim(s). THE FOREGOING STATES eGAIN'S ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS.\n\n10. Term and Termination.\n\n10.1 Term and Termination. This Agreement shall continue in effect from the Effective Date for a one (1) year period, unless earlier terminated as set forth below, and thereafter shall renew automatically for successive one (1) year periods unless either party gives the other party at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of its intent not to renew the Agreement. In addition, either party may terminate this Agreement by giving to the other party written notice\n\neGAIN COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION\n\nHOSTING AGREEMENT\n\nof such termination upon the other party's material breach of any material term (subject to the other party's right to cure within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice), the other party's insolvency, or the institution of any bankruptcy or similar proceedings by or against the other party.\n\n10.2 Effect of Termination. Upon any termination of this Agreement, eGain shall immediately cease providing all Hosting Services, and Customer shall no longer have access to the Software or the eGain System. Except in the event of termination for Customer's breach, eGain shall provide Customer with an electronic copy of the final Reports (covering the month just prior to termination of this Agreement). eGain shall be entitled to retain a copy (whether electronic or otherwise) of the Online Messages and the Reports for its records and internal purposes and shall not disclose such Online Messages or Reports to any third party except as permitted under Section 4. Within fifteen (15) days of any termination of this Agreement, Customer shall pay to eGain all unpaid fees accrued prior to termination. Sections 4, 5 (as to amounts accrued but unpaid), 7, 8, 10.2 and 12 and Exhibit A (as to amounts accrued but unpaid) shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n11. Customer References. Customer agrees that, during the term of this Agreement, eGain may reference Customer in eGain's customer listings and may place Customer's name and logo on eGain's Web site and in collateral marketing materials relating to eGain's products and services. Customer hereby grants eGain a right to use Customer's trademarks (name and logo only) designated by Customer for such limited uses, subject to Customer's trademark/logo usage guidelines, if any, provided by Customer to eGain.

If any provision of this Agreement shall be declared invalid, illegal or unenforceable, all remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect. All waivers of any rights or breach hereunder must be in writing to be effective, and no failure to enforce any right or provision shall be deemed to be a waiver of the same or other right or provision on that or any other occasion.

The rights or  remedies  set forth in this  Agreement  are in addition to any other rights or remedies  which may be granted by law.\n\n                                      32\n\n      19.3  GOVERNING  LAW/JURISDICTION.

The  parties  agree  that if any  provisions  of this Agreement may be construed in two ways,  one of which would render the provision illegal or  otherwise  voidable or  unenforceable,  and the other of which would render  the  provision  valid and  enforceable,  such  provision  shall have the meaning which renders it valid and  enforceable.  The language of all provisions of this  Agreement  shall be  construed  according  to its fair  meaning and not strictly  against any party. It is the intent of the parties that the provisions of this  Agreement  be enforced  to the  fullest  extent and should any court or other public agency  determine that any provision  herein is not  enforceable as written  in  this  Agreement,  the  provision  shall  be  amended  so that it is enforceable to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies of the  jurisdiction in which the enforcement is sought.

To the extent feasible, all such information will be properly de-identified.\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) Collaboration Assays. During the Term, Biocept shall keep Life Technologies reasonably apprised of its plans to add analytes to the Assay. In addition, Life Technologies may desire for Biocept to develop a specific new analytes for the Assay (for example, the inclusion of additional mutations to the mutation analysis component of the Assay), to be offered by the parties as an additional Test under this Agreement. In either case, the parties shall negotiate in good faith an amendment to this Agreement that will govern the development (as needed) and commercialization of such Tests with new analytes (each a \"Collaboration Assay\"), which amendment may include financial support, contributions of and access to each party's technology and/or clinical samples, milestones, timing of the development effort, exclusivity and ownership rights. Any such agreed upon Collaboration Assay development shall be performed by Biocept or jointly as the parties may agree. Once the parties have agreed upon a plan relating to the development of a particular Collaboration Assay, if development is needed (each, a \"Project\"), the parties shall reduce such agreement to writing, which shall include a project plan which will set forth each party's obligations with respect to the Project (each, a \"Project Plan\") and thereafter, such Collaboration Assay shall be deemed a Test for all purposes under this Agreement and shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement as amended. Each such Project Plan shall be attached as a part of Exhibit D to this Agreement following written acceptance thereof by both parties without any additional action required on the part of either party. Any amendments or revisions to a Project Plan shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties in writing.\n\n(g) Costs and Expenses. Unless otherwise specified herein or in a Project Plan attached hereto, each party shall perform its activities under this Agreement at its sole cost and expense.\n\n(h) Training and Education.\n\n(i) The parties shall work together to develop and implement a training program for client services and the sales and marketing representatives of each party to ensure that a clear and consistent message is delivered to all prospective customers. Following such implementation, each party agrees to train its client services and sales and marketing representatives in accordance with such training program.\n\n(ii) Representatives of each party, where deployed, shall each educate physicians, clinical and support personnel on the Tests, their applications and benefits, and the procedures for providing samples for the Tests. The Joint Steering Committee will approve all presentation and meeting materials. In addition, the parties will each be responsible for providing customer support related to test logistics, billing and reimbursement, and for establishing a call center to handle inquiries related to the Tests. For purposes of clarity, the parties acknowledge and agree that Life Technologies will not be required to establish a dedicated web portal, but all results of Tests will be made available through an existing Life Technologies portal solution, once commercially available for use, as determined by Life Technologies at its sole discretion. Technical or\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\nprocess questions regarding the Tests received by Life Technologies can be referred to Biocept. Each party will cover its own costs related to physician education, customer support, and any travel related thereto and comply with all federal and state regulations regarding the same.\n\n(i) Performance Standards. Each party shall conduct its activities under this Agreement and any Project Plan in a professional and workmanlike manner, and in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of applicable Laws and regulations, to attempt to achieve the objectives of this Agreement efficiently and expeditiously. Each party shall contribute such personnel and resources, and shall maintain such laboratories and other facilities, as are reasonably necessary to carry out the activities to be performed under this Agreement, including any Project Plans. In conformity with standard industry practices and the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party shall prepare and maintain, or shall cause to be prepared and maintained, complete and accurate written records, accounts, notes, reports and data with respect to activities conducted by such party under this Agreement, including any Project Plans. In addition, the parties shall work together to establish minimum agreed upon performance standards with respect to the promotion, sales and performance of the Tests, including the Demand Forecast, and the timely supply, accuracy, reliability and reporting of the Tests, as well as responsiveness to customer inquiries related to the Tests throughout the Territory (collectively, \"Performance Standards\"). In the event that one or more Performance Standards are not met by a party, the parties will work quickly and efficiently to (i) identify the cause of the failure, (ii) develop a plan to remediate the issue, and (iii) implement the remediation plan. If the parties are unable to successfully resolve a Performance Standards issue by this procedure, such failure to maintain Performance Standards shall constitute a material breach by the party failing to maintain such Performance Standards, and the other party may terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 11.2.\n\n(j) Bundling. Neither party shall bundle its assays (including the Tests) with any assays of the other party, without the prior written approval of that party.   4.

Biocept hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Life Technologies, its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, consultants and agents (the \"Life Technologies Indemnitees\"), from and against any and all Losses to the extent such Losses arise directly or indirectly out of: (a) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Biocept Indemnitee; (b) the material breach by Biocept of any warranty, representation, covenant or agreement made by it in this Agreement; or (c) the performance by Biocept of the Technical Component of the Assay or Test; except, in each case, to the extent such Losses result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Life Technologies Indemnitee or the material breach by Life Technologies of any warranty, representation, covenant or agreement made by it in this Agreement.\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n12.3 Procedure. In the event a party seeks indemnification under Section 12.1 or 12.2, it shall inform the other party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") of a claim as soon as reasonably practicable after such party (the \"Indemnified Party\") receives notice of the claim (it being understood and agreed, however, that the failure by an Indemnified Party to give notice of a claim as provided in this Section 12.3 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligation under this Agreement except and only to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is actually damaged as a result of such failure to give notice), shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume direction and control of the defense of the claim (including the right to settle the claim solely for monetary consideration), and shall cooperate as requested (at the expense of the Indemnifying Party) in the defense of the claim. The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of such action, suit, proceeding or claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of such action, suit, proceeding or claim or consent to any judgment in respect thereof that does not include a complete and unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect thereto, that imposes any liability or obligation on the Indemnified Party or that acknowledges fault by the Indemnified Party; in each case, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party.\n\n12.4 Insurance. Each party, at its own expense, shall maintain product liability and other appropriate insurance (or self- insure) in an amount consistent with industry standards during the Term and shall name the other party as an additional insured with respect to such insurance. Each party shall provide a certificate of insurance (or evidence of self-insurance) evidencing such coverage to the other party upon request.   13. DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n13.1 Dispute Resolution. The parties recognize that disputes as to certain matters may arise from time to time during the Term. The parties shall first submit the dispute to the Joint Steering Committee for resolution in accordance with Section 4.3 hereof. In the event that the Joint Steering Committee is unable to resolve the dispute, the parties shall be entitled to seek relief in a court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the full extent allowed by law, either party may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction for injunctive relief (or any other provisional remedy) to protect the parties' rights or enforce the parties' obligations under this Agreement pending resolution of any claims related thereto by the Joint Steering Committee.   14. GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n14.1 Governing Law. This Agreement and any disputes, claims, or actions related thereto shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to the conflicts of law provisions thereof.\n\n14.2 Entire Agreement; Modification.

Neither party is a legal representative of the other party, and neither party can assume or create any obligation, representation, warranty or guarantee, express or implied, on behalf of the other party for any purpose whatsoever.\n\n14.4 Non-Waiver. The failure of a party to insist upon strict performance of any provision of this Agreement or to exercise any right arising out of this Agreement shall neither impair that provision or right nor constitute a waiver of that provision or right, in whole or in part, in that instance or in any other instance. Any waiver by a party of a particular provision or right shall be in writing, shall be as to a particular matter and, if applicable, for a particular period of time and shall be signed by such party.\n\n14.5 Assignment. Except as expressly provided hereunder, neither this Agreement nor any rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned or otherwise transferred by either party without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); provided, however, that either party may assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder without the other party's consent in connection with the transfer or sale of all or substantially all of the business of such party to which this Agreement relates to a Third Party, whether by merger, sale of stock, sale of assets or otherwise (a \"Change of Control Event\"). The rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the parties. Any assignment not in accordance with this Agreement shall be void.\n\n14.6 No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is neither expressly nor impliedly made for the benefit of any party other than those executing it.\n\n14.7 Severability. If, for any reason, any part of this Agreement is adjudicated invalid, unenforceable or illegal by a court of competent jurisdiction, such adjudication shall not affect or impair, in whole or in part, the validity, enforceability or legality of any remaining portions of this Agreement. All remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect as if the original Agreement had been executed without the invalidated, unenforceable or illegal part.\n\n14.8 Notices.

Limited Warranty and Disclaimer of All Other Warranties: EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTY, IF ANY, THAT THE PRODUCTS COMPLY WITH THE SPECIFICATIONS IDENTIFIED IN WRITING ON THE FACE OF OR ACCOMPANYING THIS ORDER, SELLER MAKES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES IN THIS ORDER OR OTHERWISE. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SELLER DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ALL WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND/OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. SELLER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY TO BUYER FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF PROFITS, INCOME, OR REVENUE, LOSS OF TIME OR INCONVENIENCE, LOSS OR DAMAGE TO ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT, COST OF SUBSTITUTED OR REPLACEMENT EQUIPMENT, LOSS TO FACILITIES, LOSS OF CAPITAL, LOSS OF SERVICES OR ANY OTHER INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF THIS ORDER OR THE OPERATION, FUNCTION OR CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PRODUCTS PURCHASED HEREUNDER OR OTHERWISE PROVIDED BY SELLER. IN THE EVENT THAT PRODUCTS DO NOT SATISFY SPECIFICATIONS, THEY WILL BE REPLACED, AT SELLER'S OPTION, WITH PRODUCTS THAT DO SATISFY THE SPECIFICATIONS AT SELLER'S SOLE EXPENSE. SAID REPLACEMENT IS THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF BUYER.   9. Limitation of Liability: To the fullest extent permitted by law, the parties waive and relinquish any claims, demands, causes of action or recoveries for punitive damages, exemplary damages, or statutory damages. Seller shall not be liable for indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages arising under this Agreement or otherwise with respect to the sale of the products, including any lost revenues or profits, consequential and/or incidental damages, business interruption or damage to business reputation, regardless of the theory upon which any claim may be based, including any statutory causes of action or claims. In no event will Seller's entire liability to Buyer, including any liability in the event the exclusive remedy set forth in this Agreement fails of its essential purpose, exceed the purchase price actually paid by Buyer for the products hereunder, or any defective portion thereof, whichever is the lesser amount.   10. Force Majeure: Seller shall have no liability or obligation to Buyer of any kind, including but not limited to any obligation to ship products, arising from any delay or failure to perform all or any part of this Order as a result of causes, conduct or occurrences beyond Seller's reasonable control, including, but not limited to, commercial impracticability, fire, flood, act of war, civil disorder or disobedience, act of public enemies, terrorist acts, terrorism generally affecting commerce, problems associated with transportation (including car or truck shortages), acts or failure to act of any state, federal or foreign governmental or regulatory authorities, labor disputes or strikes.   11. Relationship: The relationship between Seller and Buyer shall be that of independent contractors. Seller, its agents and employees, shall under no circumstances be deemed the employees, distributors, franchisees, agents or representatives of Buyer.\n\n\n\n\n\n12. Default: The failure of Buyer to perform any obligations hereunder, including without limitation, the payment of the purchase price for products and all other amounts due hereunder, the failure to materially perform other agreements between Buyer and Seller, or Buyer's bankruptcy or insolvency, shall constitute a default under this Agreement and shall, in addition to any other remedies, afford Seller all of the remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of Illinois. In the event of default, Seller may, in addition to pursuing any of the remedies provided by law, equity or as set forth in this Agreement, refuse to make available for shipment products under this or any other agreement relating to the products, and may also cancel this Order and any pending orders without liability to Buyer. It is expressly understood that Seller's remedies are cumulative to the fullest extent permitted by law.   13. Attorneys' Fees: In the event it becomes necessary for Seller to enforce the terms and conditions of this Order by litigation or otherwise, or to defend itself in any Controversy (as defined herein), litigation, claim, demand or cause of action arising out of or as a result of this Order or the products or services provided hereunder, and if Seller is the substantially prevailing party in said Controversy, litigation, claim, demand or cause of action, then Seller shall be entitled to recover, in addition to any other relief granted or damages assessed, its reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness fees, costs, and all expenses of litigation.   14. Waiver: No claim or right arising out of a breach of this Order can be discharged in whole or in part by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless the waiver or renunciation is supported by consideration and is in writing signed by the aggrieved party.   15. Severability: If any term, covenant, warranty or condition of this Order, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall, to any extent, be held or deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Order or the application of such term, covenant or provision, to persons or circumstances other than those to which it is held invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each remaining term, covenant or provision of this Order shall be deemed valid and enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.   16. Indemnification: To the fullest extent permitted by law, Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold Seller harmless from any and all claims, demands, subrogation claims by Buyer's insurers, causes of action, liabilities, fines, regulatory actions, seizures of product, losses, costs, expenses (including, but not limited to attorneys' fees, expert witness expenses and litigation expenses) (hereinafter \"Claim\"), arising from or in connection with any Claim asserted against Seller for any damage, injury, death, loss, property damage, environmental liability, or any other Claim, whether in tort, contract, or otherwise, relating to this Order, the business relationship between the parties or the goods provided hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer has no indemnity obligation to Seller with respect to any Claims that result solely from the negligence of Seller and this indemnity provision does not purport to indemnify Seller solely for its own negligence, but rather for the negligence or conduct, whether sole or concurrent, of Buyer. Buyer, for itself and its insurers, expressly waives any and all limitations or liability caps, if any, on Buyer's contribution liability to Seller, and any and all statutory or common law lien rights or Claims against Seller arising from any applicable workers compensation or disability acts, which Buyer might or could assert against Seller or Seller's insurers in the event of the personal injury or death of Buyer's employees, representatives or servants. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer, for itself and its insurers, also waives any liens, claims or other rights it may have as a result of being subrogated to any rights of its employees, representatives or servants.   17. Insurance: Buyer shall obtain comprehensive general liability coverage, including contractual liability coverage, naming Seller as an additional named insured, in amounts sufficient to fully protect Seller under this Agreement from loss, damage or casualty caused by Buyer or incurred by Seller under this Agreement.   18. Governing Law and Forum Selection: This agreement shall be governed by and subject to the internal laws (exclusive of the conflicts of law provisions) and decisions of the courts of the State of Illinois. The parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal court in Chicago, Illinois or the state court located in DuPage County, Illinois with respect to all litigation, claims, causes of action, demands, Controversies (as defined\n\n\n\n\n\nherein) or disputes among the parties. The only exception to this forum selection provision is a claim by Seller seeking the replevin of the products in the event the courts specified in this provision will not or cannot assert jurisdiction. All counterclaims, if any, in connection with the replevin claim, shall be subject to this forum selection provision."}]}, {"title": "AzulSa_20170303_F-1A_EX-10.3_9943903_EX-10.3_Maintenance Agreement1", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "GLOBAL MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT (", "answer_start": 2657}], "id": "AzulSa_20170303_F-1A_EX-10.3_9943903_EX-10.3_Maintenance Agreement1__Document Name", "question": "The name of the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "AVIONS DE TRANSPORT REGIONAL", "answer_start": 454}, {"text": "AZUL LINHAS A\u00c9REAS BRASILEIRAS S/A", "answer_start": 400}, {"text": "Hereinafter individually referred to as the \"Party\" or collectively as the \"Parties\", as the context requires.", "answer_start": 3634}, {"text": "the \"Repairer\"or \"ATR\",", "answer_start": 3589}, {"text": "\"Company\" or \"AZUL\",", "answer_start": 3209}], "id": "AzulSa_20170303_F-1A_EX-10.3_9943903_EX-10.3_Maintenance Agreement1__Parties", "question": "The two or more parties who signed the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "March 9th 2015", "answer_start": 2752}], "id": "AzulSa_20170303_F-1A_EX-10.3_9943903_EX-10.3_Maintenance Agreement1__Agreement Date", "question": "The date of the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [], "id": "AzulSa_20170303_F-1A_EX-10.3_9943903_EX-10.3_Maintenance Agreement1__Effective Date", "question": "The date when the contract is effective\u00a0", "is_impossible": true}, {"answers": [{"text": "The Agreement shall end on the End Date without any further action, unless otherwise provided under this Agreement.", "answer_start": 32399}, {"text": "\"End Date\"\n\n\n\nmeans the date on which this Agreement is terminated or expires, and shall be the earlier to occur of the following, as appropriate:   (i) the end of the Initial Term as defined in Clause 3.1of this Agreement; or,   (ii) the end of the term of each annual renewal of this Agreement as per Clause 3.2 of this Agreement; or,   (iii) the date on which all or part of this Agreement is terminated as per Clause 16 (\"Termination\");", "answer_start": 15620}, {"text": "The Agreement enters into force on the Signing Date; it will have a duration of [*****] as from the Start Date (the \"Initial Term\").", "answer_start": 32035}], "id": "AzulSa_20170303_F-1A_EX-10.3_9943903_EX-10.3_Maintenance Agreement1__Expiration Date", "question": "On what date will the contract's initial term expire?", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "Upon expiry of the Initial Term, this Agreement [*****] unless a Notice of non-renewal is given by either Party to the other Party [*****] prior to the expiry of the Initial Term or the end of a renewal period, if any.", "answer_start": 32174}], "id": "AzulSa_20170303_F-1A_EX-10.3_9943903_EX-10.3_Maintenance Agreement1__Renewal Term", "question": "What is the renewal term after the initial term expires?

If either party shall default           under this Section, the other party shall be entitled to specific           performance.  If Licensee shall fail to give notice of the exercise of           its right of first\n\n                                          4\n\n          refusal under this Section within such ninety (90) day period, or if           Licensee shall notify the Offeree within such ninety (90) day period           that Licensee has waived such right, then the Offeree shall have the           right to sell, transfer or convey all or the applicable portion of the           stock in, or assets of, Licensor (as specified in the Offering Notice)           pursuant to the terms of the specific offer described in the           applicable Offering Notice, but not otherwise.  If such sale, transfer           or conveyance is not consummated in accordance with the offer and the           Terms and Conditions specified in the applicable Offering Notice, the           rights of Licensee to an Offering Notice shall be reinstated.  No           exercise or waiver by Licensee of any of its rights hereunder shall           modify, abridge, impair or affect any of Licensee's rights under any           of the other terms or provisions of this Agreement.  Any sale,           transfer or other conveyance of all or any part of the stock in, or           assets of, Licensor in violation of this Section shall be null and           void.

Such option shall be exercisable during a period (the           \"Option Period\") commencing on and including the earlier of (i) the           date upon which Licensee shall have paid to Licensor, in any single           fiscal year of Licensee, royalty payments hereunder in the aggregate           amount of $10,000,000 or (ii) January 1, 2002, and ending upon the           expiration or sooner termination of this Agreement.

Licensee may           exercise the Option by written notice to Licensor and Skunkware at any           time during the Option Period.  Upon any such exercise of the Option,           Licensee and Licensor or Skunkware (as the case may be) shall proceed           to diligently and in good faith negotiate and execute a definitive           purchase and sale agreement for Licensor's acquisition of all of the           assets of, or outstanding capital stock in, Licensor, as the case may           be.  In the event that Licensee and Licensor or Skunkware, as the case           may be, are unable to agree on any terms or conditions for such           acquisition, the same shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance           with the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association,           with the arbitrator(s) to be experienced in the mainframe software           industry.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provision for arbitration           concerning the terms of any purchase and sale agreement, and without\n\n\n\n\n\n          limiting any other\n\n                                          5\n\n          conditions that may be included in any such purchase and sale           agreement, Licensee shall have no obligation to consummate the           acquisition of the assets of, or stock in, Licensor pursuant to its           exercise of the Option if Licensee's board of directors should           determine, in its sole discretion, that such acquisition would not be           accretive to the value of Licensee.  The definitive purchase and sale           agreement shall provide that License may pay the purchase price           thereunder in cash, in shares of its Common Stock or in some           combination thereof.  So long as the Option shall be in existence           (whether or not exercisable), Skunkware and Licensor agree that           Licensor will conduct its business in the ordinary course and will           not, without the prior written consent of Licensee, merge or           consolidated with any other entity, sell all or substantially all of           its assets, grant or permit to exist any lien or encumbrance on any           material portion of its assets, issue any securities to any person           other than Skunkware or engage in any other transaction or enter into           any other agreement other than in the ordinary course of business.            Skunkware further agrees that, so long as the Option shall be in           existence (whether or not exercisable), it shall be and remain the           sole Stockholder Licensor, and Licensor shall not issue to any other           person or entity any stock, warrants or similar rights to acquire           equity interests in Licensor.\n\n     9.

Excite maintains a site on the Internet at http://www.excite.com (the      \"Excite Site\") and owns and/or manages related Web Sites worldwide      (collectively, the \"Excite Network\") which, among other things, allow users      to search for and access content and other sites on the Internet.\n\nB.   Excite also maintains and/or manages certain Web pages which may be      delivered to users via email, desktop \"channels\" or Internet \"push\"      technologies (collectively, \"Broadcast Pages\") which may incorporate      content supplied to Excite by third parties for the purpose of providing      value to Excite users and providing access to the content, products and/or      services of such third parties.\n\nC.   Sponsor is in the business of distributing certain online retail music      merchandise and related content and maintains a Web site at      http://www.musicblvd.com (the \"Sponsor Site\") and other Web sites through      which it makes this merchandise and this content available to its users.\n\nD.   Sponsor wishes to be the exclusive retail store music sponsor of the Excite      Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages, to distribute its music-related      content through the Excite Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages and to      promote its online retail music merchandise business to Excite.com users.\n\nTherefore, the parties agree as follows:\n\n1.       EXCLUSIVITY, TERM AND RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL\n\n      a)       Sponsor will be the exclusive retail music store sponsor of                   the Excite Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages. Excite will                   not permit the display of advertising banners, promotional                   buttons, promotional links or other promotional materials for                   any retail sale of Music Products on the Excite Site, except                   those Music Products offered by Sponsor, nor advertising by                   any other Retail Music Store. \"Retail Music Store\" shall mean                   any entity which is primarily engaged in the sale of Music                   Products at retail to consumers. \"Music Products\"     2                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL\n\n              shall mean pre-recorded music hard goods, digitally                  distributed music (except live and/or cybercast events), music                  books (to the extent this Agreement does not conflict with                  Excite's existing agreement with Amazon.com), music-related                  t-shirts and apparel, and music videos (except live and/or                  cybercast events).\n\n              Notwithstanding the foregoing, Excite may make available                  opportunities on the Excite Site to purchase Music Products                  from parties other than Sponsor if such Music Products are not                  available from Sponsor so long as, prior to entering into                  arrangements to make available opportunities to purchase Music                  Products from parties other than Sponsor, Excite notifies                  Sponsor of its interest in the Music Products and gives Sponsor                  thirty (30) days to make the desired Music Products available                  through the Sponsor Site. Excite and Sponsor acknowledge that                  certain market opportunities may arise in which the desired                  Music Products must be made available on less than thirty (30)                  days advance notice and will work together in good faith to                  maximize those opportunities. In no event will Excite enter                  into arrangements to make available opportunities to purchase                  Music Products from parties other than Sponsor that would                  prevent Sponsor from being the exclusive source of such Music                  Products on the Excite Site once the Music Products become                  available through Sponsor.\n\n      b)      The term of this Agreement will begin on the Effective Date and                  will end on the second (2nd) anniversary of the Commencement                  Date. The \"Commencement Date\" means the date on which Excite                  commences delivery of Impressions (defined below). The parties                  anticipate the Commencement Date will be on or about October                  15, 1997.\n\n      c)      The parties' existing agreements regarding sponsorship of the                  WebCrawler Web site (http://webcrawler.com) and all of the                  existing advertising buys on the Excite Network will be                  terminated as of the Commencement Date. Excite will credit                  Sponsor in an amount equal to [****]. This credit will be\n\n\n\n\n\n              applied to reduce the first year exclusivity fee described in                  Section 7(b) and will be reflected in a reduction of Sponsor's                  December 31, 1997 payment to Excite described in Section 7(e).\n\n      d)      Excite will offer Sponsor the right of first refusal to                  negotiate with Excite for renewal of this sponsorship.\n\n                                    2    3                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL\n\n               i) Excite will not propose, solicit or negotiate offers from                   entities other than Sponsor for any retail music store                   sponsorships of the Excite Site, if at all, until [****] prior                   to the expiration of the term of this Agreement.\n\n               ii) Commencing not later than [****] prior to the expiration                   of the term of the Agreement, Excite will negotiate with                   Sponsor in good faith with respect to the terms and conditions                   under which this Agreement would be renewed. Excite will                   negotiate exclusively with Sponsor for the next [****] in good                   faith effort to negotiate and execute a written sponsorship                   renewal agreement. If, [****] prior to the expiration of the                   term of the Agreement, the parties have not entered into a                   written sponsorship renewal agreement. Excite may enter into                   negotiations with any third party with respect to retail music                   store sponsorships of the Excite Site.\n\n               iii) In the event that Excite intends to enter into an                   agreement with a third party with respect to retail music                   store sponsorships of the Excite Site before the expiration of                   the term of the Agreement, Excite will deliver to Sponsor a                   written notice describing the relevant opportunity. Although                   Excite will not be required to disclose any information in                   violation of any nondisclosure agreement between Excite and                   any third party, the notice will include information                   sufficient to permit Sponsor to evaluate the requirements for                   meeting the competing offer for retail music store sponsorship                   of the Excite Site and to formulate a meaningful response.                   Sponsor will have [****] after receipt of such written notice                   to provide notice to Excite that it is prepared to enter into                   an agreement with Excite on the same terms and conditions as                   Excite proposes to accept from such third party. Excite and                   Sponsor will then promptly commence good faith negotiations to                   conclude the agreement.\n\n               iv) If Sponsor rejects said offer or fails to notify Excite of                   its acceptance within the [****] period, Excite shall have                   the right thereafter to enter into the agreement with such                   third party, provided the terms and conditions of the                   agreement (if entered into within the subsequent ninety (90)                   days) are not less favorable to Excite than previously offered                   by Sponsor.\n\n                                    3    4                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL\n\n2.       IMPRESSIONS\n\n      a)       \"Impression\" means any appearance of a link to the Sponsor                   Site whether graphic, text or any combination of graphic and                   text. More than one Impression may appear on a page, except,                   however, not more than three (3) Impressions per Channel page                   will count towards delivery of guaranteed Impressions and, of                   these 3 Impressions, at least two (2) will link to pages in                   the Sponsor Site offering Music Products; not more than two                   (2) Impressions per generic search results page will count                   towards delivery of guaranteed Impressions and, of these 2                   Impressions, at least one (1) will link to pages in the                   Sponsor Site offering Music Products; and no more than one (1)                   Impression per specific search results page will count towards                   delivery of guaranteed Impressions. In all events, Excite will                   make a good faith effort to avoid duplicate Impressions on a                   single page, but in no event will more than one (1)                   Impression for the same artist on a Music Product page count                   towards delivery of guaranteed Impressions. For the purposes                   of this Agreement, \"generic search results page\" is an Excite                   Search results page displayed in response to a query                   concerning generic music topics and a \"specific search results                   page\" is an Excite Search results page displayed in response                   to a query concerning a specific music artist or specific                   album title.\n\n      b)      Excite and Sponsor will work together in good faith to define                  mutually agreeable Impressions in the Excite Site designed to                  provide content of interest (defined below) to Excite users                  and/or promote the Sponsor Site, in numbers sufficient to meet                  the Impression guarantees stated in Section 3.\n\n      c)      Excite and Sponsor will collaborate on the design, appearance,                  and placement (the \"look and feel\") of all Impressions. Excite\n\n\n\n\n\n              will have final approval over the look and feel of the                  promotional Impressions, which approval will not be                  unreasonably withheld.\n\n3.       IMPRESSION GUARANTEES\n\n      a)       During the first year of the sponsorship following the                   Commencement Date, Excite will deliver not less than                   [****] Impressions on the Excite Site.\n\n      b)       During the second year of the sponsorship following the first                   anniversary of the Commencement Date, Excite will deliver not                   less than [****] Impressions on the Excite Site.\n\n                                    4    5                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL\n\n      c)       Excite will report traffic, Impressions and click-thrus to                   Sponsor on a monthly basis.\n\n4.       CONTENT PROVIDED TO EXCITE\n\n      a)       Sponsor will provide to Excite the content described in                   Exhibit A (\"Content\"), subject to the terms and conditions                   hereunder. Excite may incorporate music-related content on the                   Excite Site from parties other than Sponsor so long as any                   links in or associated with such third-party content relating                   to opportunities to purchase Music Products will link to pages                   in the Sponsor Site. Any Content which appears in the Excite                   Site will be accompanied by attribution or branding                   identifying Sponsor as the source of the Content and linking                   to the Sponsor Site.\n\n      b)       Sponsor will ensure that the Content will at all times feature                   the full array of content and functionality as made generally                   available by Sponsor at the Sponsor Site and its related Web                   sites, through any other means of distribution of Sponsor's                   own branded service or through any other third-party                   relationship, where Sponsor controls the Content.\n\n      c)       Sponsor and Excite will determine mutually agreeable methods                   for the transmission and incorporation of updates to the                   Content.\n\n      d)       Excite will have sole control over the \"look and feel\" of the                   Excite Site and the Excite Network. Excite will have sole                   control over the content, composition, \"look and feel\" and                   distribution of the Broadcast Pages. Excite will have sole                   responsibility for providing, hosting and maintaining, at its                   expense, the Excite Network and for providing and delivering                   the Broadcast Pages and for integration of Content into the                   Broadcast Pages.\n\n      e)       Sponsor will have sole responsibility for providing, at its                   expense, the Content to Excite.\n\n5.       THE CO-BRANDED AREA OF THE SPONSOR SITE AND DISTRIBUTION THROUGH THE           EXCITE SITE AND THE BROADCAST PAGES\n\n      a)       Sponsor will design and create Web pages (\"Co-Branded Pages\"                   or, collectively, the \"Co-Branded Area\") in the Sponsor Site                   incorporating music-related content to be mutually determined                   by the parties including but not limited to Content described                   in Exhibit A, subject to the terms and conditions hereunder.                   Each Co-Branded Page will display the name and/or brands of                   Sponsor and Excite.\n\n                                    5    6                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL\n\n               Sponsor and Excite will collaborate on the \"look and feel\" of                   the Co-Branded Pages including, but not limited to, the                   display, appearance and placement of the parties' respective                   names and/or brands and of advertising displayed on the                   Co-Branded Pages. Excite will have final approval over the                   \"look and feel\" of the Co-Branded Pages, which approval will                   not be unreasonably withheld.\n\n      b)       The Co-Branded Area will reside completely on the Sponsor                   Site. Sponsor will have sole responsibility for providing and                   maintaining, at its expense, the Sponsor Site, the Co-Branded                   Area, the content displayed on the Co-Branded Site and any                   updates thereto.\n\n      c)       Each Co-Branded Page will include one or more links to the                   Excite Site. Excite will supply Sponsor with the URLs for                   these links.\n\n      d)       Excite may, upon fifteen (15) days prior notice to Sponsor,                   request reasonable revisions to the Co-Branded Area as needed                   to reflect changes that will not adversely affect Sponsor,                   such as changes to Excite's name and/or brand or changes to                   the URLs for the links to the Excite Site. Sponsor will use                   reasonable efforts to accommodate Excite's requested changes\n\n\n\n\n\n               within the fifteen (15) day period.\n\n      e)       Excite may incorporate reasonable portions of the Content on                   the Excite Site. Each such display of the Content will count                   as an Impression, as defined in Section 2(a). Excite will                   provide links to the Co-Branded Area from any pages on the                   Excite Site on which the Content appears.

This                            three-month Total Revenue amount will be compared to                            an amount equal to two (2) times the corresponding                            three-month share of the applicable sponsorship fee                            described in Sections 6(c) and 6(d) (each pro rata                            share a \"Revenue Floor\").\n\n                                    8    9                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL\n\n               iii)     If the Total Revenue earned by Sponsor during the                            three-month period exceeds the total of the Revenue                            Floor applicable to the same three-month period,                            Sponsor will pay Excite [****] of the gross margin                            Sponsor realizes on the gross revenue amount equal to                            the excess of the Total Revenue over the Revenue                             Floor during the three-month period.                   iv)      If the Total Revenue earned by Sponsor during the                            three-month period does not exceed the Revenue Floor                            applicable to the same three-month period, Sponsor                            will not be obligated to pay Excite any share of the                            gross revenue realized during the three-month period.\n\n      g)       Payments of shared gross margin will be due to Excite within                   thirty (30) days of the end of each calendar quarter in which                   the revenue is recognized by Sponsor.\n\n      h)       With each payment, Sponsor will provide to Excite                   documentation reasonably detailing the calculation of the                   payment.\n\n      i)       Sponsor will maintain accurate records with respect to the                   calculation of all payments due under this Agreement. Excite                   may, upon no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice                   to Sponsor, cause an independent Certified Public Accountant                   to inspect the records of Sponsor reasonably related to the                   calculation of such payments during Sponsor's normal business                   hours. The fees charged by such Certified Public Accountant in                   connection with the inspection will be paid by Excite unless                   the payments made to Excite are determined to have been less                   than ninety percent (90%) of the payment owed to Excite, in                   which case Sponsor will be responsible for the payment of the                   reasonable fees for such inspection.\n\n8.

TERMINATION             a)       If Excite fails to deliver the guaranteed number of                   Impressions on the Excite Site during the first year, Excite                   will use commercially reasonable efforts to \"make good\" the                   shortfall. If Excite fails to \"make good\" the shortfall within                   [****] following the first year end, Sponsor may terminate the                   Agreement in accordance with Section 11 (b).\n\n      b)       If Excite fails to deliver the guaranteed number of                   Impressions on the Excite Site during the second year, Excite                   will use commercially reasonable efforts to \"make good\" the                   shortfall within [****] following the second year end.                   However, the term of this Agreement will continue until Excite                   has made good the guaranteed number of Impressions on the                   Excite Site.

For the purposes of the                   calculation of revenue sharing during this \"make good\" period                   only, the \"Revenue Floor\" from the last quarter of the second                   year of the term of the Agreement will apply.          c)       Either party may terminate this Agreement if the other party                   materially breaches its obligations hereunder and such breach                   remains uncured for thirty (30) days following the notice to                   the breaching party of the breach, with the following                   exceptions:\n\n               i)       Excite will promptly notify Sponsor of any errors,                            failures or outages of the Content. Sponsor will                            promptly notify Excite of any errors, failures or                            outages of the Co-Branded Area.\n\n                                    11    12                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL\n\n                        Sponsor will take all reasonable measures to correct                            any such errors or outages as soon as reasonably                            possible.

Any VRRM-MFP Shares unsold in a remarketing will be returned to the relevant tendering Beneficial Owners or their Agent Members, or the relevant tendering Holders, as the case may be, by the Remarketing Agent; provided that such tender will continue until the earlier of the occurrence of a successful remarketing or the Failed Remarketing Mandatory Redemption Date.\n\n(i) Timing Requirements. The Remarketing Agent agrees to the remarketing timing requirements applicable to it in the Supplement. The Remarketing Agent may, in its sole discretion, modify the settlement procedures set forth therein with respect to any Remarketing upon ten (10) days' prior written notice to the Fund and the Calculation and Paying Agent, provided any such modification does not adversely affect the Holders, the Beneficial Owners, the Calculation and Paying Agent or the Fund.\n\n(j) Purchases by Remarketing Agent. If the Remarketing Agent in its sole discretion decides to purchase unsold VRRM- MFP Shares for its own account, on each Purchase Date, the Remarketing Agent will settle such purchase through delivery against payment of the Purchase Price for such VRRM-MFP Shares to be received by the Remarketing Agent by 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Purchase Date. The Remarketing Agent is not obligated to purchase any VRRM-MFP Shares that would otherwise remain unsold in a remarketing.\n\n(k) Sales by Remarketing Agent for its Own Account. It is expressly understood and agreed by the parties hereto that VRRM-MFP Shares as to which the Remarketing Agent is the Beneficial Owner may be held by the Remarketing Agent for its own account or for the account of others, and may be sold in a remarketing or otherwise sold by the Remarketing Agent.

Whenever the Fund intends or expects to include any Taxable Allocation in any dividend on VRRM-MFP Shares, the Fund shall provide a Notice of Taxable Allocation in accordance with Section 2.7(a) of the Supplement. Whenever such advance notice is received from the Fund, the Calculation and Paying Agent will notify each Holder and the Remarketing Agent.

Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Remarketing Agent and the Fund.\n\n(a) The Remarketing Agent hereby represents, warrants and agrees that it has, and during the term of this Agreement shall maintain, all licenses, consents and other rights required for the use of any index or other data in connection with calculation of the Dividend Rate or dissemination thereof.\n\n(b) The Fund represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the Remarketing Agent as as of each Purchase Date, Remarketing Date or New Mode Commencement Date, as applicable (each, a \"Representation Date\"), that (i) the Fund has made all the filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"Commission\") that are required to be made under the 1940 Act and the 1940 Act Regulations (collectively, the \"1940 Act Documents\"), (ii) each 1940 Act Document complies in all material respects with the requirements of the 1940 Act and the 1940 Act Regulations, and each 1940 Act Document did not at the time of filing with the Commission include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (iii) the applicable Remarketing Materials, as amended or supplemented, including by any subsequently filed 1940 Act Document on or prior to such Representation Date (or, if applicable, by any document filed pursuant to the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations), as provided by the Fund, will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that the Fund makes no representations or warranties with respect to information provided by the Remarketing Agent specifically for use in the Remarketing Materials.\n\n(c) The financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the 1940 Act Documents, together with the related notes and schedules, present fairly the financial position of the Fund as of the dates indicated and the results of operations, cash flows and changes in shareholders' equity of the Fund for the periods specified and have been prepared in compliance with the requirements of the 1940 Act and the 1940 Act Regulations and in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved; the other financial and statistical data contained or incorporated by reference in the 1940 Act Documents are accurately and fairly presented and prepared on a basis consistent with the financial statements and books and records of the Fund.\n\n(d) The Fund agrees (i) to deliver to the Remarketing Agent, within fifteen (15) calendar days following the last day of each calendar month beginning with [\u25cf], a report of 6\n\n\n\n\n\nportfolio holdings of the Fund as of the close of business as of the last Business Day of such calendar month, listing portfolio holdings of the Fund by CUSIP and principal amount, and (ii) that, on or after such fifteenth calendar day (or earlier, with the Fund's prior approval) the Remarketing Agent may provide such report and/or the information therein to investors in the VRRM- MFP Shares, upon the investor's request.\n\nSection 4. Fees and Expenses. For the performance of its services as Remarketing Agent hereunder, the Fund shall pay to the Remarketing Agent in arrears on the first day of each calendar month (or, if such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day) a monthly fee for each MFP Share Outstanding on the first calendar day of the preceding calendar month (or the date hereof in the case of the first such payment), in an amount, rounded upward to the nearest dollar, equal to (a) the product of (i) the rate of compensation as then in effect, as shall be agreed upon from time to time in writing by the Fund and the Remarketing Agent, times $[\u25cf] multiplied by (ii) the actual number of days from and including such first calendar day of the preceding calendar month (or the date hereof in the case of the first such payment) to and including the last calendar day of such preceding calendar month or, if applicable, the date of termination of this Agreement, if earlier, or the date of any prior redemption or liquidation for such share (as the case may be), divided by (b) 360. The obligation of the Fund to make the payments required by this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and remain in full force and effect until all such payments shall have been made in full.\n\nSection 5. Resignation, Suspension and Removal of the Remarketing Agent.\n\n(a) The Remarketing Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares by giving 90 days' prior written notice to the Fund and the Calculation and Paying Agent.\n\n(b) The Fund may remove the Remarketing Agent with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares by giving at least 60 days' prior written notice to the Remarketing Agent (and will provide prior notice also to the Calculation and Paying Agent, if any); provided, however, that no such removal shall become effective for an additional 30 days unless the Fund shall have appointed at least one nationally recognized securities dealer with expertise in remarketing variable rate securities as a successor Remarketing Agent for the VRRM-MFP Shares and the successor Remarketing Agent shall have entered into a remarketing agreement with the Fund, in form and substance satisfactory to the Fund, in which it shall have agreed to, among other duties, conduct remarketings in respect of VRRM-MFP Shares and determine the Dividend Rate on each Business Day for the VRRM-MFP Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Supplement.\n\nIn each of the occurrences described in clause (a) or (b), the Fund shall use its best efforts to appoint a successor Remarketing Agent for such VRRM-MFP Shares and enter into a remarketing agreement with such Person as soon as reasonably practicable.\n\nSection 6. Dealing in the VRRM-MFP Shares. The Remarketing Agent in its sole discretion may purchase for its own account VRRM-MFP Shares in a remarketing; however, subject to the last two sentences in Section 2(c) above, the Remarketing Agent shall not be obligated to purchase any VRRM-MFP Shares that would otherwise remain unsold in a 7\n\n\n\n\n\nremarketing. None of the Fund, the Calculation and Paying Agent nor the Remarketing Agent (subject to the last sentence in Section 2(c) above) shall be obligated in any case to provide funds to make payment to a Beneficial Owner or its Agent Member or a Holder upon such Beneficial Owner's or Holder's tender of its VRRM-MFP Shares in a remarketing unless, in each case, such VRRM-MFP Shares were acquired for the account of the Fund, the Calculation and Paying Agent or the Remarketing Agent, as applicable. The Remarketing Agent may exercise any vote or join in any action which any Holder of VRRM-MFP Shares may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Statement with like effect as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder. The Remarketing Agent, in its individual capacity, either as principal or agent, may also engage in or have an interest in any financial or other transaction with the Fund as freely as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder.\n\nSection 7. Information.\n\n(a) The Fund agrees to furnish to the Remarketing Agent: (i) copies of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Statement, the Supplement and its bylaws and any amendment thereto and each report or other document mailed or made available to Holders (including annual reports to shareholders) or filed by the Fund with the Commission (including any documents incorporated therein by reference) as the Remarketing Agent may reasonably request from time to time; (ii) notice of the creation of any subsidiary by the Fund; (iii) notice of the purchase of VRRM-MFP Shares by a subsidiary or affiliate of the Fund as soon as the Fund shall become aware of such purchase; (iv) notice of any change (including being put on Credit Watch or Watchlist), suspension or termination in or of the ratings on the VRRM-MFP Shares by any NRSRO then rating the VRRM-MFP Shares or any change of an NRSRO rating the VRRM-MFP Shares as promptly as practicable upon the occurrence thereof or the occurrence of any of the events set forth in clause (b)(i) or (b)(ii) of Section 8 hereof (with the occurrence of any of the events described in clause (b)(ii) to be determined without regard to the opinion of the Remarketing Agent referred to therein); and (v) in connection with a remarketing, a Remarketing Memorandum, and such other remarketing information, as the Remarketing Agent may reasonably request from time to time, including but not limited to the financial condition of the Fund. The Fund agrees to provide the Remarketing Agent with as many copies of the foregoing materials and information as the Remarketing Agent may reasonably request for use in connection with a remarketing or Transition Remarketing, as the case may be, of VRRM-MFP Shares and consents to the use thereof for such purpose.\n\n(b) If at any time during the term of this Agreement any event or condition known to the Fund relating to or affecting the Fund or the VRRM-MFP Shares shall occur which might affect the accuracy or completeness of any statement of a material fact contained in any of the reports, documents, materials and information referred to in clause (a)(v) above or any document incorporated therein by reference (collectively, the \"Remarketing Materials\") or any other materials or information made publicly available by the Fund, the Fund shall promptly notify the Remarketing Agent in writing of the circumstances and details of such event or condition and the Fund shall promptly prepare or cause to be prepared and delivered to the Remarketing Agent, at the Fund's expense, a supplement or amendment to the Remarketing Materials describing the circumstances and details of such event or condition. 8\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 8. Conditions to Obligations of the Remarketing Agent. The obligations of the Remarketing Agent with respect to VRRM-MFP Shares under this Agreement have been undertaken in reliance on, and shall be subject to: (a) the due performance in all material respects by the Fund of its obligations and agreements as set forth in this Agreement (including Sections 3(c) and 7(b) hereof); and (b) the non-occurrence of any of the following events: (i) all of the VRRM-MFP Shares shall have been redeemed by the Fund; (ii) without the prior written consent of the Remarketing Agent, the Supplement, the Statement, the Declaration, the by-laws of the Fund, or the Tender and Paying Agent Agreement shall either not be in full force and effect or have been amended in any manner that in the reasonable opinion of the Remarketing Agent materially changes the nature of the VRRM- MFP Shares or the remarketing procedures; (iii) legislation, or a decision by a court of the United States shall be rendered, or a stop order, ruling, regulation or official statement by, or on behalf of, the Commission or other governmental agency having jurisdiction of the subject matter shall be made, to the effect that the offering or sale of the VRRM-MFP Shares is or would be in violation of any provision of the 1933 Act as then in effect, or the 1934 Act as then in effect, or with the purpose or effect of otherwise prohibiting the offering or sale of the VRRM-MFP Shares, as contemplated hereby, without registration under the 1933 Act; (iv) any legislation, resolution, ordinance, rule or regulation shall be enacted by, any governmental body, department or agency of the United States or the State of New York, or a decision by any court of competent jurisdiction within the United States or the State of New York shall be rendered, which, in the Remarketing Agent's reasonable opinion, materially adversely affects the marketability of the VRRM-MFP Shares; (v) additional material restrictions not in force as of the date hereof shall have been imposed upon trading in securities generally by any governmental authority or by any national securities exchange, which, in the Remarketing Agent's reasonable opinion, would cause the performance of the Remarketing Agent's obligations hereunder to violate applicable law; (vi) any litigation shall be instituted and be outstanding, to restrain or enjoin the sale or remarketing of the VRRM-MFP Shares or in any way protesting or affecting any authority of the Fund with respect to the validity of the VRRM- MFP Shares or this Agreement, or the existence or powers of the Fund to perform its obligations hereunder; (vii) a general banking moratorium has been declared by federal or New York authorities having jurisdiction, a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services or a force majeure event shall have occurred which in the reasonable opinion of the Remarketing Agent materially adversely affects the settlement or clearance of the VRRM-MFP Shares; or (viii) a material misstatement or omission in the Remarketing Materials has occurred, so that it is not advisable, in the reasonable judgment of the Remarketing Agent, to attempt to remarket the VRRM-MFP Shares, provided that the Remarketing Agent, upon identifying any such material misstatement or omission in the Remarketing Materials, shall promptly notify the Fund. In the event of the failure of any such conditions with respect to the VRMM-MFP Shares, the Remarketing Agent may terminate its obligations under this Agreement with respect to the VRMM-MFP Shares as provided in Section 10(b).\n\nSection 9. Indemnification.\n\n(a) The Fund and the Investment Adviser, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Remarketing Agent and its respective officers, directors, employees and control persons within the meaning of the 1934 Act (collectively, the \"Indemnified Persons\" 9\n\n\n\n\n\nand individually, an \"Indemnified Person\") from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which any Indemnified Person may become subject insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any of the Remarketing Materials or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading (except with respect to information provided by the Remarketing Agent specifically for use therein), or arise out of, or are based upon, any violation by the Fund or the Investment Adviser of, or any failure by the Fund or the Investment Adviser to perform, any of its obligations under, this Agreement. The Fund and the Investment Adviser agree to promptly reimburse each Indemnified Person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in investigating, defending or preparing to defend any such action or claim; provided, however, that neither the Fund nor the Investment Adviser shall be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of the use by the Remarketing Agent of any information that is not contained in the Remarketing Materials (in the form provided for use in connection with the remarketing). The indemnity agreement in this paragraph shall be in addition to any liability or obligation which the Fund or the Investment Adviser may otherwise have to any Indemnified Person and shall extend upon the same terms and conditions to each Person, if any, who controls any Indemnified Person within the meaning of the 1934 Act.\n\n(b) The Fund agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Persons from and against every loss, liability or expense, including without limitation, damages, fines, suits, actions, demands, costs, out-of-pocket expenses, and reasonable legal fees and expenses (collectively, \"Losses\"), that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against, any Indemnified Person for or in respect of its (1) execution and delivery of this Agreement, (2) compliance or attempted compliance with or reliance upon any instruction or other direction upon which the Remarketing Agent is authorized to rely pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and (3) performance under this Agreement, except to the extent that the Loss resulted from such Indemnified Person's gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith, violations of law or violations of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Fund agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Persons from and against any and all Losses that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against, any Indemnified Person for or in respect of the failure of the Remarketing Agent to deliver Remarketing Materials during the course of a remarketing, if such failure is due to the failure by the Fund to provide to the Remarketing Agent such Remarketing Materials for delivery (regardless of whether the Remarketing Agent has requested such Remarketing Materials), notwithstanding that such failure by the Remarketing Agent to deliver Remarketing Materials during the course of a Remarketing could be deemed a violation of law by an Indemnified Person. The indemnity agreement in this paragraph shall be in addition to any liability or obligation which the Fund may otherwise have to any Indemnified Person.\n\n(c) Each Indemnified Person shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each of the Fund and the Investment Adviser (collectively, the \"Indemnifying Persons\" and individually, an \"Indemnifying Person\") of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify the Indemnifying Persons 10\n\n\n\n\n\nshall not relieve any Indemnifying Person from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. No settlement or compromise of any such action shall be made without the consent of the Indemnifying Persons, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.\n\n(d) In case any such action is brought against any Indemnified Person, and it notifies each Indemnifying Person from which it seeks indemnification of the commencement thereof, such Indemnifying Person (which may be the Fund and/or the Investment Adviser, in the case of notification of either) will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other Indemnifying Person, similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof so long as its interests are not adverse to those of the Indemnified Person, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, and after notice from each Indemnifying Person to such Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Person will not be liable to such Indemnified Person under this Section 9 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. Upon assumption by any Indemnifying Person of the defense of any such action or proceeding, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to participate in such action or proceeding and to retain its own counsel but the Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any legal expenses of other counsel subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the Indemnifying Person has agreed to pay such fees and expenses, (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall have failed to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person in a timely manner, or (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have been advised by counsel that there are actual or potential conflicting interests between the Indemnifying Persons and the Indemnified Person, including situations in which there are one or more legal defenses available to the Indemnified Person that are different from or additional to those available to each of the Fund and the Investment Adviser. If the Indemnifying Person elects not to assume the defense of any such suit, it will reimburse the Indemnified Persons for the reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by them. In the event that the parties to any such action (including impleaded parties) include one or more Indemnifying Persons and one or more Indemnified Persons, and one or more Indemnified Persons shall have been advised by counsel reasonably satisfactory to each Indemnifying Person that there may be one or more legal defenses available to any of the Indemnified Persons, which are different from, additional to, or in conflict with those available to any of the Indemnifying Persons, the Indemnifying Persons will reimburse the Indemnified Persons for the reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by the Indemnified Persons (it being understood that the Indemnifying Persons shall not, in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (plus local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, which firm shall be designated by the Indemnified Persons, the Remarketing Agent or each Indemnifying Person, as the case may be). Each Indemnifying Person agrees promptly to notify each Indemnified Person of the commencement of any litigation or proceedings against it in connection with the remarketing of the VRRM-MFP Shares. No Indemnifying Person shall consent to the terms of any compromise or settlement of any action defended by any Indemnifying Person in accordance with the foregoing without the prior consent of the Indemnified Person. No Indemnifying Person shall be liable under this Section 9 for the amount of any compromise or settlement of any action 11\n\n\n\n\n\nunless such compromise or settlement has been approved in writing by such Indemnifying Person, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.\n\n(e) If the indemnification provided for in subparagraph (a) of this Section 9 is unavailable, because of limitations imposed by securities laws or for any other reason, to a party that would otherwise have been an Indemnified Person under subparagraph (a) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then the party that would have been an Indemnifying Person thereunder shall, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion so that the Remarketing Agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the Remarketing Agent's fee (calculated for a one year period) with respect to such remarketing bears to the aggregate liquidation preference of such VRRM-MFP Shares being remarketed but will not exceed the amount of such fee (calculated for a one year period) and each of the Fund and the Investment Adviser is responsible for the balance; provided, however, that no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereon referred to above in this subparagraph (e)) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claims (which shall be limited as provided in this subparagraph (e) above if the Indemnifying Person has assumed the defense of any such action in accordance with the provisions thereof).\n\n(f) The indemnity agreements contained in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 9 shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agent, and shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement and the remarketing of any VRRM-MFP Shares hereunder.\n\nSection 10. Termination of Remarketing Agreement. (a) This Agreement shall terminate as to the Remarketing Agent and its obligations hereunder with respect to VRRM-MFP Shares upon the earliest to occur of (a) the effective date of the resignation or removal of such Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 5(a) and Section 5(b), respectively, (b) the completion of a successful Transition Remarketing on a New Mode Commencement Date in connection with transition to a new Mode, or (c) the date on which no VRRM-MFP Shares are Outstanding.\n\n(b) In addition, the Remarketing Agent may terminate this Agreement and all of its obligations hereunder with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares, by notifying the Fund and the Calculation and Paying Agent of its election to do so, if any of the conditions referred to or set forth in Section 8 hereof with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares have not been met or satisfied in full and such failure shall have continued for a period of 30 days after the Remarketing Agent has given notice thereof to the Fund specifying the condition which has not been met and requiring it to be met; provided, however, that termination of this Agreement with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares by the Remarketing Agent after giving the required notices with respect to the VRRM- MFP Shares shall be immediate in the event of the occurrence and continuation of 12\n\n\n\n\n\nany event set forth in Section 8(b)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) hereof with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares, or in the event the Remarketing Agent determines, in its sole discretion, that it shall not have received all of the information, whether or not specifically referenced herein, necessary to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares.\n\nSection 11. Remarketing Agent's Performance; Duty of Care.\n\n(a) The duties and obligations of the Remarketing Agent shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement and the Supplement. No implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement, or the Supplement. In the absence of bad faith on the part of the Remarketing Agent, the Remarketing Agent may conclusively rely upon any document furnished to it, which purports to conform to the requirements of this Agreement and the Statement, as to the truth of the statements expressed in any of such documents. The Remarketing Agent shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to have been signed, presented or made by the proper party or parties. The Remarketing Agent shall incur no liability to the Fund, the Investment Adviser, the Calculation and Paying Agent or to any Beneficial Owner (or its Agent Member) or any Holder of the VRRM-MFP Shares in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent for any action or failure to act, in connection with its duties under this Agreement and the Supplement or otherwise, except as a result of bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part.\n\n(b) The Remarketing Agent shall not be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement arising out or caused by the failure of any other party (other than an affiliate of the Remarketing Agent) to provide any notice, statement or document required to be delivered pursuant to any Related Document in connection with performance by the Remarketing Agent of the relevant obligation.\n\nSection 12. Amendment, Supplement or Modification of Agreements. Without the prior written consent of the Remarketing Agent, the Fund will not agree or consent to any amendment, supplement or modification of the Tender and Paying Agent Agreement, this Agreement or the Supplement, nor waive any provision thereof, if such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver would materially adversely affect the interests of the Remarketing Agent, in the Remarketing Agent's sole discretion; provided, that, for purposes of this Section 12, any changes or amendments to the rating agency criteria provided in the Supplement for the VRRM-MFP Shares shall not be deemed to materially adversely affect the interests of the Remarketing Agent.\n\nSection 13. Books and Records. The Remarketing Agent shall keep such books and records with respect to the performance of its duties hereunder as shall be consistent with prudent industry practice and shall, to the extent permitted by law, make such books and records available for inspection by the Fund on reasonable notice during normal business hours. Any costs and expenses associated with such inspections shall be for the account of the party requesting such inspection.\n\nSection 14. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of New York, except Section 25 below, which shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 13\n\n\n\n\n\nin each case without regard to conflict of laws principles that would require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.\n\nTHE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY SUBMIT TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL AND NEW YORK STATE COURTS LOCATED IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY MATTERS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.\n\nSection 15. Waiver of Jury Trial. The Fund, the Investment Adviser and the Remarketing Agent hereby waive trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by any of the parties hereto against the other on any matters whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected with this Agreement.\n\nSection 16. Certain Provisions to Survive Termination of Agreement. Regardless of any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the obligations of the Fund and the Investment Adviser pursuant to Sections 3, 4 and 9 hereof and of the Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 9 hereof shall remain operative and in full force and effect until fully satisfied.\n\nSection 17. Successors and Assigns. The rights and obligations of the Fund and the Investment Adviser hereunder may not be assigned or delegated to any other person without the prior written consent of the Remarketing Agent. The rights and obligations of the Remarketing Agent hereunder may not be assigned or delegated to any other person without the prior written consent of the Fund. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Fund, the Investment Adviser and the Remarketing Agent and their respective permitted successors and assigns, and, subject to Section 23, will not confer any benefit upon any other person, partnership, association or corporation other than persons, if any, controlling any Remarketing Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, or any Indemnified Person to the extent provided in Section 9 hereof. As used in this Section 17, the terms \"successors\" and \"assigns\" shall not include any purchaser of VRRM-MFP Shares merely because of such purchase.\n\nSection 18. Headings. The section headings herein are for convenience of reference only, and it is agreed that such section headings are not a part of this Agreement and will not be used in the interpretation of any provisions of this Agreement.\n\nSection 19. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held or deemed to be or shall, in fact, be invalid, inoperative or unenforceable as applied in any particular case in any or all jurisdiction or jurisdictions, because it conflicts with any provision of any constitution, statute, rule of public policy, or for any other reason, such circumstances shall not have the effect of rendering the provision in question invalid, inoperative or unenforceable in any other case, circumstance or jurisdiction, or of rendering any other provision or provisions of this Agreement invalid, inoperative or unenforceable to any extent whatsoever.\n\nSection 20. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be regarded as an original and all of which shall constitute one and the same document. 14\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 21. Remarketing Agent Not Acting as Underwriter. It is understood and agreed by the parties hereto that the only obligations of the Remarketing Agent hereunder are as set forth in Sections 2, 3, 9 and 13 hereof. When engaged in remarketing any properly-Tendered VRRM-MFP Shares, the Remarketing Agent shall act only as agent for and on behalf of each owner of the VRRM-MFP Shares so tendered. The Remarketing Agent shall not act as an underwriter for the Tendered VRRM- MFP Shares and shall in no way be obligated to advance its own funds to purchase any Tendered VRRM-MFP Shares (except as provided in Section 2(c) or to the extent that in its individual capacity as purchaser of those VRRM-MFP Shares it may elect, in accordance with Section 6 hereof, to purchase, in its sole discretion) or to otherwise expend or risk its own funds or incur or become exposed to financial liability in the performance of its duties hereunder.\n\nSection 22.

(the \"Investment Adviser\"), Securian Financial Services, Inc. (the \"Underwriter\") and Securian Funds Trust (the \"Trust\"), a  Delaware statutory trust, on behalf of the Trust's Advantus Money Market Fund (the \"Fund\").\n\nWHEREAS, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization approved by both the Board of Trustees of the Trust and the Board of  Directors of Advantus Series Fund, Inc. (the \"Series Fund\") on July 28, 2011, and approved by a majority of the shareholders of each Portfolio of  the Series Fund on October 21, 2011, each Portfolio of the Series Fund was reorganized into a separate Fund of the Trust effective as of May 1,  2012; and\n\nWHEREAS, the Investment Adviser, the Underwriter and the Series Fund have previously entered into a Net Investment Income  Maintenance Agreement, effective as of February 1, 2009 and an Amended and Restated Net Investment Income Maintenance Agreement  effective as of October 29, 2009 (the \"Prior Agreements\"); and\n\nWHEREAS, the parties have determined that each desires to restate and adopt the Prior Agreements as set forth herein; and\n\nWHEREAS, the Trust is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\"), as an open-end management  company of the series type, and the Fund is a series of the Trust; and\n\nWHEREAS, the Trust and the Investment Adviser have entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement dated May 1, 2012 (the \"Advisory  Agreement\"), pursuant to which the Investment Adviser will render investment advisory services to the Fund for compensation based on the  value of the average daily net assets of the Fund; and\n\nWHEREAS, the Trust and the Underwriter have entered into an Underwriting and Distribution Agreement dated May 1, 2012 (the  \"Underwriting Agreement\") pursuant to which the Underwriter acts the principal underwriter for the Fund, and receives compensation thereunder  pursuant to the Fund's Rule 12b-1 Plan; and\n\nWHEREAS, the Trust and the Investment Adviser have determined that it is appropriate and in the best interests of the Fund and its  shareholders to maintain the Fund's daily \"Net Investment Income\" (as defined in paragraph 1.1 below) at or in excess of zero.\n\n\n\n\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   2\n\n1. Net Investment Income Maintenance.\n\n\n\n1.1 Net Investment Income. \"Fund Investment Income\", as defined in paragraph 1.2 below, minus \"Fund Operating Expenses\" as defined  in paragraph 1.3 below equals Net Investment Income. If the Fund's Net Investment Income on any day is below zero, the Investment  Adviser shall waive its Advisory Fee or reimburse the Fund an amount (defined as \"Expense Waiver\") sufficient to produce a Net  Investment Income of zero.\n\n  1.2 Fund Investment Income. Fund Investment Income includes interest and dividends, net of foreign withholding taxes, plus income from  securities lending activities, if applicable. Fund Investment Income does not include realized and unrealized gains or losses on  investments and foreign currencies.\n\n\n\n1.3 Fund Operating Expenses. Fund Operating Expenses are the aggregate expenses of every character incurred by the Fund, including but  not limited to investment advisory fees of the Investment Adviser (but excluding interest, taxes, brokerage commissions and other  expenditures which are capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and other extraordinary expenses not  incurred in the ordinary course of the Fund's business). Fund Operating Expenses do not include \"acquired fund fees and expenses\"  as defined in SEC Form N-1A, as it may be amended from time to time.\n\n\n\n1.4 Method of Computing Expense Waiver. To determine the Expense Waiver (Investment Adviser's liability), each day the Fund  Operating Expenses shall be subtracted from the Fund Investment Income to produce the daily Net Investment Income. If the daily Net  Investment Income is below zero for any day, the Investment Adviser shall first waive or reduce its advisory fee for such day by an  amount sufficient to bring the Net Investment Income to zero. If the amount of the waived or reduced advisory fee for any such day is  insufficient to bring the Net Investment Income to zero , the Investment Adviser shall also pay Fund expenses or reimburse the Fund  an amount that, together with the waived or reduced advisory fee, is sufficient to bring the Net Investment Income to zero.\n\n\n\n1.5 Right of Recovery. The Investment Adviser shall have the option to recover the full amount waived, paid or reimbursed (the Expense  Waiver) by the Investment Adviser on any day on which the Fund's Net Investment Income exceeds zero. In no event, however, shall  the Expense Waiver, or any portion thereof, constitute an obligation of the Fund to the Investment Adviser on any such day unless  the Investment Adviser has expressly exercised its right to recover all or a portion of the Expense Waiver on that day, in which case  such portion of the Expense Waiver elected by the Investment Adviser for recovery that day shall then be due and payable. If, and to  the extent, the payment by the Fund to the Investment Adviser of the Expense Waiver would cause the Fund's Net Investment Income  to fall below zero, such payment shall be deferred until such date on which the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn connection with the obligation of the Investment Adviser to maintain the Fund's Net Investment Income as set forth in section 1 herein,  the Underwriter may waive its Rule 12b-1 fees contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, and shall have the same rights to be reimbursed  by the Fund as the Investment Adviser, as set forth in Section 1 herein, to the extent the Investment Adviser has not already been  reimbursed by the Fund for its payment of Rule 12b-1 fees.\n\nThis Agreement shall continue in effect for a period of one year from the date of its execution and from year to year thereafter provided such  continuance is specifically approved by a majority of the trustees of the Trust who (i) are not \"interested persons\" of the Trust or any other party  to this Agreement, as defined in the 1940 Act, and (ii) have no direct or indirect financial interest in the operation of this Agreement (\"Non- Interested Trustees\"). This Agreement will terminate upon the termination of the Advisory Agreement except the Investment Adviser's Right of  Recovery set forth in section 1.5 herein.\n\n\n\n   3\n\n\n\npayment would not cause the Fund to have a Net Investment Income of less than zero, provided that the right of the Investment  Adviser to receive such payment shall expire three years after the day it effected such waiver, or made such payment or reimbursement.  For purposes of this paragraph 1.5 (and for purposes of paragraph 2), the Expense Waiver that may be recovered from the Fund shall  include the amount of any unrecovered Expense Waiver under the Prior Agreements, provided that the Investment Adviser's right to  receive such payment shall also expire three years after the day it effected such waiver, or made such payment or reimbursement.\n\n\n\n1.6 Payment. If the Investment Adviser is required to reimburse the Fund, the Investment Adviser shall make such payment within 30 days  after each month-end in the amount due the Fund as of each month. If the Fund is required to pay the Investment Adviser the Expense  Waiver, the Fund shall make such payment within 30 days after each month-end. Reimbursements to the Fund or the Expense Waiver  shall not include any additional charges or fees whatsoever, including, e.g., interest accruable on such reimbursements or the Expense  Waiver.\n\n  1.7 Operating Expense Limit. Any Expense Waiver recovery payment by the Fund to the Investment Adviser shall not cause the Operating  Expense for the Fund's full year of operations to exceed 1.25% of the Fund's average daily net assets.\n\n2. The Underwriter.\n\n3. Term and Termination of Agreement.\n\n4. Miscellaneous.\n\n  4.1 Captions. The captions in this Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and in no other way define or delineate any  of the provisions hereof or otherwise affect their construction or effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly executed as of the day and year first above written.\n\n\n\n\n\n   4\n\n  4.2 Interpretation. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to require any party hereto to take any action contrary to its Articles of  Incorporation or Agreement and Declaration of Trust or By-Laws, or any applicable statutory or regulatory (including self-regulatory)  requirement to which it is subject or by which it is bound.\n\n\n\n4.3 Definitions. Any question of interpretation of any term or provision of this Agreement, including, but not limited to the investment  advisory or Rule 12b-1 fee, the computations of net asset values, and the allocation of expenses, having a counterpart in or otherwise  derived from the terms and provisions of the Advisory Agreement, the Underwriting Agreement, or the 1940 Act, shall have the same  meaning as and be resolved by reference to such Advisory Agreement, the Underwriting Agreement, or the 1940 Act.\n\nSECURIAN FUNDS TRUST\n\nBy:    /s/ David M.

(\"Moody's) within thirty (30) days of such Ratings       Event and subject to written confirmation from Fitch and Moody's that       delivery of such collateral in the context of such downgrade will not       result in a withdrawal, qualification or downgrade of the then current       ratings assigned to the Certificates. For the avoidance of doubt, a       downgrade of the rating on Wells Fargo Mortgage Backed Securities 2006-6       Trust, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-6, Class I-A-22       (the \"Certificates\") could occur in the event that UBS AG does not post       sufficient collateral.\n\nFor purposes of this Transaction, a \"Ratings Event\" shall occur with       respect to UBS AG if its long term unsecured debt rating (the \"Long Term       Rating\") ceases to be rated at least \"A1\" by Moody's Investors Service,       Inc. or at least \"A+ by Fitch Ratings (such ratings being referred to as       the \"Approved Ratings Threshold\"), (unless, within 30 days after such       withdrawal or downgrade Fitch and Moody's have reconfirmed the rating of       the Certificates which were in effect immediately prior to such withdrawal       or downgrade).\n\n2. Swap Disclosure Event. If upon the occurrence of a Swap Disclosure Event (as defined in paragraph (xxiii) above), UBS AG has not, within 5 business days after such Swap Disclosure Event complied with any of the provisions set forth in paragraph (xxiii) above, then an Additional Termination Event shall have occurred with respect to UBS AG with UBS AG as the sole Affected Party with respect to such Additional Termination Event.\n\nTransfer, Amendment and Assignment:\n\nNo transfer, amendment, waiver, supplement, assignment or other modification of this Transaction (other than the pledge of this Transaction to the Master Servicer pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) shall be permitted by either party unless Moody's and Fitch have been provided notice of the same and confirm in writing (including by facsimile transmission) that they will not downgrade, qualify, withdraw or otherwise modify its then-current rating of the Certificates; provided however that except with respect to a transfer at the direction of UBS, nothing in this provision shall impose any obligation on UBS to give notice to any rating agency.\n\nPermitted Security Interest:\n\nFor purposes of Section 7 of the Agreement, UBS AG hereby consents to the Permitted Security Interest.\n\n\"Permitted Security Interest\" means the collateral assignment by the Counterparty of the Cap Collateral to the Master Servicer pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and the granting to the Master Servicer of a security interest in the Cap Collateral pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.\n\n\"Cap Collateral\" means all right, title and interest of the Counterparty in this Agreement, each Transaction hereunder, and all present and future amounts payable by UBS AG to the Counterparty under or in connection with the Agreement or any Transaction governed by the Agreement, whether or not evidenced by a Confirmation, including, without limitation, any transfer or termination of any such Transaction.\n\nPayer Tax Representations\n\nFor the purposes of Section 3(e) of the Master Agreement, UBS AG will make the\n\n\n\n\n\nfollowing representation and Counterparty will not make the following representation: it is not required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, of any Relevant Jurisdiction to make any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax from any payment (other than interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or 6(e) of the Master Agreement) to be made by it to the other party under this Agreement.

The term \"Imbalance\" means the cumulative difference in a Month between: (i) the quantity of Gas in MMBtu received for the account of Customer at the Point(s) of Receipt, less Customer's System Fuel & LUAF quantity, as applicable, and (ii) the quantity of Gas in MMBtu delivered for the account of Customer at the Point(s) of Delivery. After any adjustment for System Fuel & LUAF, if the Imbalance is the result of receipts at the Point(s) of Receipt exceeding the delivered (or scheduled, as applicable) quantity of Gas for Customer's account at the Point(s) of Delivery, it is a \"Positive Imbalance\". If the Imbalance is a result of receipts at the Point(s) of Receipt being lower than the delivered quantity of Gas for Customer's account at the Point(s) of Delivery, it is a \"Negative Imbalance\". Imbalances will be cashed out on a Monthly basis.   8\n\nSource: PENNTEX MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP, S-1/A, 4/16/2015\n\n\n\n\n\nCash Out. The cash-out settlement price will be the monthly arithmetical average of the prices (\"Cash-out Price\") as posted in Gas Daily's Daily Price Survey during the Month under the heading \"Texas Gas Transmission Corp.,\" under the column labeled \"Index\" corresponding to the row labeled \"Zone 1.\" Transporter will pay Customer an amount that is the product of the Positive Imbalance each Month, if any, and the Cash-out Price. Customer will pay Transporter an amount that is the product of the Negative Imbalance each Month, if any, and the Cash-out Price. If the actual monthly volume varies by more than five percent (5%) from the delivered volumes for the Month, then the Cash-out Price will be adjusted as follows:\n\n\n\n1. For Negative Imbalances, the Cash-out Price will be increased by the percentage variance, rounded up to the nearest whole percentage point, between the Point(s) of Delivery volumes and the adjusted Point(s) of Receipt volumes. (i.e., if the adjusted receipt volume from Customer is 7% less than the Point(s) of Delivery volume, then the Index Price will be increased by 7%), however in no event shall the Cash-Out Price be increased more than 10%; and\n\n\n\n2. For Positive Imbalances, the Cash-out Price will be decreased by the percentage variance, rounded up to the nearest whole percentage point, between the Point(s) of Delivery volumes and the adjusted Point(s) of Receipt volumes. (i.e., if the adjusted receipt volume from Customer is 7% greater than the Point(s) of Delivery volume, then the Index Price will be increased by 7%), however in no event shall the Cash-Out Price be increased more than 10%.\n\nArticle V. Curtailment\n\nIf the quantity of Customer Gas and all other Gas available for delivery into the Transportation System exceeds the capacity of the Transportation System at any point, then Transporter shall interrupt or curtail receipts of Customer Gas with respect to the affected point(s) only in accordance with the following:\n\n(a) First, Transporter shall curtail all Interruptible Service Gas prior to curtailing Firm Service Gas. In the event Transporter curtails some, but not all, Interruptible Service Gas on a particular Day, Transporter shall allocate the capacity of the Transportation System available for Interruptible Service Gas at the affected points on a pro rata basis based upon Customer's last confirmed nomination of Interruptible Service Gas hereunder and the last confirmed nominations of Interruptible Service Gas from all other shippers on the Transportation System prior to the event causing the curtailment.\n\n(b) Second, if additional curtailments are required beyond those described in the immediately preceding clause (a), Transporter shall curtail Firm Service Gas. In the event Transporter curtails some, but not all, Firm Service Gas on a particular Day, Transporter shall allocate the capacity of the Transportation System at the affected point(s) on a pro rata basis based upon Customer's last confirmed nomination of Firm Service Gas hereunder and the last confirmed nominations of Firm Service Gas from all other shippers on the Transportation System prior to the event causing the curtailment.\n\nTransporter shall provide Customer notice of any interruption or curtailment of the receipt of Customer Gas into the Transportation System as is reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nArticle VI. Measurement & Testing\n\nThe construction, ownership, installation, operation and maintenance of each Measurement Facility that is owned by a Person other than Transporter shall be governed by an interconnect agreement between Transporter and such Person. Each other Measurement Facility shall be constructed, installed, owned, operated and maintained by Transporter.   9\n\nSource: PENNTEX MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP, S-1/A, 4/16/2015\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle VII.

Transporter acknowledges and agrees that Memorial Resource Development Corp. is a satisfactory guarantor.\n\nShould Customer or its guarantor fail to provide Performance Assurance within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of written demand for such assurance, then Transporter shall have the right to suspend performance under this Agreement until such time as Customer furnishes Performance Assurance. For the avoidance of doubt, such suspension of performance by Transporter shall not relieve Customer of its obligation to make payments of amounts due hereunder, including, without limitation, payment of fees due hereunder.   14\n\nSource: PENNTEX MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP, S-1/A, 4/16/2015\n\n\n\n\n\nIf during the Term, if Transporter has failed to pay any amount when due under this Agreement and if such non-payment is not being disputed in good faith by Transporter, Customer shall have the right to request and receive from Transporter adequate Performance Assurance under similar terms and conditions as described above, including the right to suspend performance under this Agreement until such time as Transporter furnishes Performance Assurance.\n\nArticle XV.

Upon such mutual agreement (or, if mutual agreement is not required, upon notice of any such changes desired by Microsoft), Inktomi shall alter the Services in order to accommodate the revised Deployment, Hosting and Maintenance Specifications.\n\n                                       3\n\n                 2.2.1  Inktomi and Microsoft will confer not less frequently than monthly regarding the appropriate size (including hardware requirements) and capacity of the Hosting Server cluster, and Inktomi will supply all available and relevant usage data it may have; Microsoft will specify its capacity desires, and, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any and all changes in capacity (including without limitation, number of Hosting Servers and connectivity capacity) requested by Microsoft shall be deemed acceptable to Inktomi, and Inktomi shall conform to such new capacity requirements in accordance with the timetable specified by Microsoft.\n\n               2.2.2  Inktomi will deploy the capacity requested by Microsoft hereunder within the timeframe specified in the Deployment, Hosting and Maintenance Specifications, or as otherwise may be agreed by Microsoft and Inktomi at such time.\n\n               2.2.3  At each monthly conference referred to above in Section 2.2.1, Inktomi will state its good faith estimate of the hardware and capacity needs for itself and its other customers. At its sole cost and expense, Inktomi promptly will provision for such hardware and capacity needs, and supply Microsoft with a list of the hardware provisioned and an officer's certification that Inktomi has made such provisions. Upon Microsoft's request (but not more often than twice in any calendar year), Inktomi will supply Microsoft with documentation evidencing such provisioning.\n\n          2.3  In accordance with its performance of the Services, Inktomi may collect and/or possess Web Indexing Data and Usage Data.\n\n               2.3.1  As between Inktomi and Microsoft, Inktomi will own all rights in and to Web Indexing Data. However, Inktomi will provide Microsoft with access to the Web Indexing Data solely for purposes of managing, marketing and promoting the Microsoft Search Engine.\n\n               2.3.2  All Usage Data shall be owned jointly by Microsoft and\n\n\n\n\n\nInktomi, and Inktomi hereby irrevocably assigns to Microsoft an [*] interest therein. However, Inktomi shall not have the right to share any of such Usage Data with third parties (except that Inktomi may include Usage Data as part of \"gross\" undifferentiated data which it shares with other search engine customers but does not indicate as Usage Data related to the Microsoft Search Engine).\n\n          2.4  Inktomi shall provide to Microsoft all reports described in the Deployment, Hosting and Maintenance Specifications, in accordance with the terms therein.\n\n                                       4\n\n[*]=CERTAIN INFORMATION IN THIS EXHIBIT HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY  WITH THE COMMISSION. CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED WITH RESPECT TO  THE OMITTED PORTIONS.\n\n            2.5  Inktomi shall strictly adhere to all Security Measures in performing the Services, including without limitation securing the Usage Data, which it may possess or have under its control from time to time, from unauthorized access and modification.\n\n          2.6  Microsoft will have the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to require Inktomi to devote a separate cluster of Hosting Servers to servicing Microsoft hereunder, which Servers would not be used to service any needs of Inktomi and/or any third parties. The Hosting Servers purchased by Inktomi at Microsoft's request hereunder would be re-deployed to such separate cluster.\n\n               2.6.1  If Microsoft notifies Inktomi in writing that it desires such a separate cluster, Microsoft shall reimburse Inktomi for all actual, direct expenses incurred and paid by Inktomi for equipment (other than Hosting Servers, which shall be purchased by Inktomi with financing loaned by Microsoft as set forth elsewhere herein) and services of necessary subcontractors (but not services of Inktomi employees) required to create and set up such separate cluster, but Microsoft's obligations to make any payments to Inktomi pursuant to clause (a) of Section 4.1 below will cease and terminate effective on the date such separate cluster becomes operational.\n\n               2.6.2  Nothing contained in this Agreement will be deemed to require Microsoft to deploy the Product in Hosting Servers owned by Inktomi, or to require Microsoft to continue to utilize Inktomi's services to host the Product at any time during the Term; without limitation, Microsoft will have the right to deploy the Product, in whole or in part, at other site(s) (whether owned by Microsoft or third parties) during the Term. If Microsoft elects to deploy and operate the Product at other sites, Inktomi will take all steps necessary or appropriate to facilitate such other deployment and operation; without limitation, Inktomi will move any and all Hosting Servers to any location(s) designated by Microsoft (costs of relocation, including shipping and insurance, to be borne exclusively by Microsoft), and Inktomi will provide training to Microsoft personnel and/or others designated by Microsoft to enable them to satisfactorily operate and maintain the Product and Hosting Servers wherever located. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Microsoft will not be obligated to make any payments to Inktomi pursuant to clauses (a), (e) and/or (f) of Section 4.1 below if Microsoft exercises its rights to move the Hosting Servers under this Section 2.6.2.\n\n          2.7  Inktomi will assign two (2) full-time Inktomi employees exclusively dedicated to maintenance duties hereunder. Such employees are identified in Exhibit D attached hereto; and their replacements shall be subject to Microsoft's prior written approval (which approval Microsoft will not unreasonably withhold). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Microsoft and Inktomi mutually agree in writing, additional Inktomi employees may be required to be assigned to maintenance duties hereunder.\n\n                                       5\n\n            2.8  Microsoft acknowledges that Inktomi has customized and provided, and will continue to customize and provide, its software and technology to other parties for use in connection with a variety of applications, including search engine applications. Except as may be expressly provided to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to (i) limit or restrict Inktomi from customizing and providing its software and technology to other parties for any purpose, including in connection with search engine applications, or (ii) in any way affect the rights granted to such other parties. Microsoft further acknowledges that in addition to utilizing the Hosting Servers to host the Product, Inktomi may also use the Hosting Servers to service its own needs and the needs of other third parties, unless Microsoft elects to use a separate cluster in accordance with Section 2.6 above (it being understood that Inktomi will estimate the capacity for servicing the needs of itself and its other customers in good faith and provision accordingly, in accordance with Section 2.2).\n\n     3.   Hosting Servers.           ---------------\n\n          3.1  Inktomi shall own all new Hosting Servers purchased by Inktomi pursuant to Microsoft's request hereunder.\n\n               3.1.1  To the extent Inktomi is required to do so in order to meet Microsoft's capacity requests under the Deployment, Hosting and Maintenance Specifications (as the same may change from time to time), Inktomi shall purchase new Hosting Servers. Prior to purchasing any such new Hosting Servers, Inktomi will seek bids from third parties, copies of which Inktomi will provide\n\n\n\n\n\nto Microsoft, and Microsoft will have the right to approve all such purchases and the applicable purchase prices. Inktomi shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the purchase prices of such new Hosting Servers, but in any event such purchase prices will not be more than any comparable equipment purchased by Inktomi during the same time frame. Inktomi will consult with Microsoft regarding the proposed purchase prices of all new Hosting Servers prior to purchasing the same, and if Microsoft is aware of a vendor who is willing to sell Hosting Servers to Inktomi at a lower purchase price than as proposed by Inktomi, Inktomi agrees to purchase the applicable new Hosting Servers from such vendor.\n\n               3.1.2  Notwithstanding Section 3.1.1 above, Inktomi shall have no obligation whatsoever to purchase any new Hosting Servers unless Microsoft loans Inktomi an amount equal to the purchase price thereof pursuant to the Loan Agreement between Inktomi and Microsoft of even date herewith (the \"Loan Agreement\").\n\n          3.2  Microsoft acknowledges that, pursuant to Inktomi's contractual arrangement with its subcontractor, Exodus Communications, Inc. (\"Exodus\"), Inktomi will locate the Hosting Servers at the facilities of Exodus, and Exodus will provide power and Internet telecommunications services to the Hosting Servers. However, Microsoft will have no obligations or liabilities to Exodus, Inktomi will remain liable for providing all\n\n                                       6\n\n  Services to Microsoft notwithstanding its arrangement with Exodus, and Inktomi will [*] and [*] against from any and all [*] to [*] (in accordance with the procedures specified in Section [*] below). A copy of the contract(s) between Inktomi and Exodus is/are attached hereto as Exhibit [*], and Inktomi shall not modify said contract(s) or replace Exodus as its subcontractor for the applicable services (including without limitation by having Inktomi perform the Services directly) without Microsoft's prior written approval (which approval Microsoft agrees to not unreasonably withhold). Inktomi shall provide Exodus with a copy of the Security Measures applicable under this Agreement and will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that Exodus strictly adheres to all such Security Measures.\n\n          3.3  Subject to Microsoft's rights under Section 2.6.2 above and/or the Security Agreement between Inktomi and Microsoft of even date herewith, executed in accordance with the Loan Agreement, Microsoft shall not have any access to the Hosting Servers, except as follows: (i) Microsoft will have electronic read-only access to \"real time\" system data on the status of the usage, accessibility and performance of the Microsoft Search Engine (via software developed by Inktomi in consultation with Microsoft), and (ii) Microsoft will have the right, upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, to have representatives escorted by Inktomi employees tour the premises where the Hosting Servers are located as necessary to ensure Microsoft's satisfaction with the operation of the physical plant and equipment. Microsoft agrees to comply with the Security Measures at all times when accessing the Hosting Servers as permitted hereunder.\n\n     4.   Payment For Services.           --------------------\n\n          4.1  As full and complete compensation for the Services, Microsoft shall pay to Inktomi the following monthly fees:\n\n               (a)  beginning with the Launch Date, the sum of [*] [*] Dollars ($[*]) (attributable to the use during the Term of the Hosting Servers owned by Inktomi as of the Effective Date), provided that in no event will Microsoft be obligated to make more than [*] ([*]) monthly payments pursuant to this clause (a), and if the Term extends beyond [*] years after the Launch Date, this clause (a) will be deemed deleted from this Agreement effective on the [*] anniversary of the Launch Date notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein;\n\n               (b)  an amount equal to [*] ([*]) of the [*], [*], [*], [*] thereon, incurred by Inktomi to purchase each new Hosting Server required to service Microsoft's needs in accordance with Section 3.1 above (attributable to the use during the Term of such new Hosting Servers); such payments will commence with respect to each new Hosting Server at such time as Inktomi's repayment obligations begin with respect to such new Hosting\n\n                                       7\n\n[*]=CERTAIN INFORMATION IN THIS EXHIBIT HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY  WITH THE COMMISSION.

Notwithstanding section 4.2 below, such payments shall be due in immediately available funds on the first business day of each month. The parties acknowledge that the monthly fee under this clause (b) will increase throughout the Term if and to the extent that Microsoft's Hosting Server requirements increase, but, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no amounts shall be payable under this clause (b) attributable to any Hosting Server which is more than [*] years old;\n\n               (c)  an amount equal to the [*] and [*] of the new Hosting Servers purchased by Inktomi pursuant to Section 3.1 above ([*] any amounts paid by Inktomi to Exodus for such services or attributable to the employees referred to in clause (f) below), payable if and when Inktomi pays such maintenance\n\n\n\n\n\ncosts; Inktomi will use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the annual hardware and software maintenance costs for each such new Hosting Server are not more than [*] percent ([*]%) of the purchase price of such New Hosting Server, and Microsoft will not be obligated to pay higher maintenance costs than such [*]% annual estimate without its prior written consent;\n\n               (d)  an amount equal to [*] Percent ([*]%) of the sum of the amounts payable under clauses (b) and (c) above (attributable as Inktomi's management fee for providing the Services);\n\n               (e)  an amount equal to Microsoft's [*] of the [*] [*] by Inktomi to Exodus in connection with the applicable Hosting Servers cluster, computed in accordance with Exhibit [*], [*] the [*] new Hosting Servers are [*] at Exodus; and\n\n               (f)  an amount equal to [*] per month per person identified in Section 2.7 above, [*] of the new Hosting Servers.\n\nIn addition, if the number of ADH (as defined in the Software Development Agreement and Information Services Agreement) should exceed the capacity requested by Microsoft, or if Inktomi's usage of its estimated capacity requirements should exceed its estimates as communicated to Microsoft in accordance with Section 2.2.1 above, then Microsoft's applicable payment(s) hereunder will be [*] in [*] with the [*] set forth in Exhibit [*] hereto.\n\n          4.2  Except as set forth in Section 4.1(b) above, Inktomi shall supply to Microsoft written invoices for all amounts due under this Agreement, and payments will be due net [*] ([*]) days from Microsoft's receipt of such invoice. Inktomi shall bear sole responsibility for all expenses incurred in connection with the performance of the Services, unless otherwise set forth herein or agreed to in writing by Microsoft.\n\n                                       8\n\n[*]=CERTAIN INFORMATION IN THIS EXHIBIT HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY  WITH THE COMMISSION.

Inktomi will permit Microsoft to have access to, and to make copies of, all such books and records for purposes of auditing and verifying such costs and expenses, provided that Microsoft shall give Inktomi reasonable notice prior to each requested audit and shall perform such audit during normal business hours at Inktomi's office(s) where such records are normally kept. If any Microsoft audit should determine that Inktomi overcharged Microsoft by an amount of [*]% or more for the period audited, then in addition to any and all other rights and remedies Microsoft may have under the circumstances, Microsoft may require Inktomi to reimburse it for all costs it incurred relating to such audit.\n\n          4.4  Taxes.                -----\n\n               4.4.1  All amounts to be paid by Microsoft to Inktomi herein are exclusive of any federal, state, local, municipal or other governmental taxes, including, without limitation, taxes based on, imposed on or measured by net or gross income or receipts, franchise taxes, taxes on doing business, capital stock taxes (including any minimum taxes and taxes measured by any item of tax preference), sales, use, excise, property, withholding or similar taxes, duties, levies, fees, excises or tariffs (all such taxes and other charges collectively \"Taxes\") now or hereafter imposed on Inktomi under applicable law (the \"Inktomi Taxes\").

Microsoft shall in turn promptly secure and deliver to Inktomi an official receipt for any Taxes withheld. Inktomi may provide to Microsoft an exemption certificate acceptable to Microsoft and to the relevant taxing authority (including without limitation a resale certificate) in which case Microsoft shall not collect the Taxes covered by such certificate.
