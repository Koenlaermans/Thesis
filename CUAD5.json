Only authorized personnel designated by Converge (\"Converge Support Personnel\") may communicate Problem Reports and Support\n\n                                        3\n\nRequests to VNE. The number of Converge Support Personnel will not exceed seven persons without VNE's prior approval. The initial Converge Support Personnel shall be identified to VNE in writing within 10 business days following the Effective Date. Converge may change the Converge Support Personnel on written notice to VNE; provided, however, that Converge shall use reasonable efforts not to change the Converge Support Personnel more frequently than once every 30 days. All replacement personnel shall be required to participate in Support Training as described in Section 3.3 below. Converge Support Personnel will be the \"single point of contact\" for the Maintenance and Support Services provided by VNE under this Section 2.\n\n            2.3 Method of Reporting. All Problem Reports and Support Requests shall be communicated by the Converge Support Personnel to VNE as follows: (1) via telephone at 1-877-249-1423, or such other telephone number(s) as VNE may provide to Converge from time to time, or (2) via electronic mail to support.solutions@verticalnet.com, or such other e-mail address(es) as VNE may provide to Converge from time to time, or (3) in person to VNE Service Personnel (if any) on Converge premises at the time; provided, however, that the Converge Support Personnel shall communicate all Severity Level 1 and Severity Level 2\n\n\n\n\n\nProblems to VNE via method (1) or method (3) above. Converge shall classify all Problems reported to VNE according to the Problem Severity Levels listed in Exhibit A attached hereto.\n\n            2.4 Support Responsibilities. Converge and the Converge Support Personnel shall be responsible for providing \"Level 1\" (help desk-type support) support to both Converge personnel (internal help desk) and Converge users (external help desk), for each of the Supported Products on which VNE has provided training as set forth in Section 3.3 below. Subject to the provisions of this Section 2, VNE shall be responsible for providing \"Level 2\" (responding to technical inquiries) and \"Level 3\" (code fixes) support for such Supported Products. In the case of Supported Products for which Converge is providing Level 1 support, Converge shall not escalate Problem Reports or Support Requests to VNE until such Problem Reports or Support Requests have been reasonably escalated through the \"Level 1\" support procedures of Converge. In addition, Converge shall conduct reasonable problem identification and isolation activities to determine whether or not a given problem relates to the Products (i.e., whether a \"Problem\" as defined exists). Converge shall not escalate Problem Reports or Support Requests to VNE prior to conducting such activities or if Converge has determined that the Problem Report or Support Request does not relate to the Supported Products.\n\n            2.5 Additional Information for Problems. With respect to each Problem reported to VNE, Converge shall provide, at the time the Problem Report is communicated to VNE and to the extent known to or reasonably ascertainable by Converge, information that will enable VNE to reproduce (in as complete a step-by-step manner as is reasonably possible), or verify the existence of the Problem, plus any additional information regarding the Problem that Converge believes will assist in the diagnosis thereof and response thereto. The parties shall reasonably cooperate to obtain and provide to VNE any additional information about the reported Problem that may be relevant to diagnosing and responding thereto. In the event that Converge is unable to make a determination based on the problem identification and isolation activities described in Section 2.4 or reproduce, or provide the information necessary for VNE to diagnose or reproduce, any Problem, Converge may request VNE's assistance in performing identification and isolation or reproducing the Problem and/or generating or documenting such information.\n\n                                        4\n\n            2.6 Response to Problem Reports. VNE shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide Converge with an initial response to and status reports for all Problems reported by Converge, and to resolve all Problems identified, in accordance with the provisions of Exhibit B attached hereto; provided, however, that VNE shall have no further obligation to respond to or attempt to diagnose or resolve a Problem once it is determined not to be attributable to Errors. VNE will review all Problem Requests submitted by Converge at the Problem Severity Level indicated by Converge unless another Problem Severity Level is clearly warranted. In the event of a reasonable uncertainty, the parties will assume a higher Severity Level for a Problem until they have sufficient information to make a determination that a lower Severity Level is warranted. If, at Converge's request, VNE responds to a Problem at a Severity Level that is higher than what proves to be the actual Severity Level of the Problem, or if VNE's review of a Problem reported by Converge establishes that the Problem was not due to an Error, Converge shall pay or reimburse VNE for all incremental fees and expenses reasonably incurred by VNE in performing such activities.\n\n            2.7 Response to Support Requests. VNE shall respond to all Support Requests submitted by Converge within a reasonable period of time, taking into consideration the nature of the Support Request, its impact on Converge's business operations and any Problem Reports or other Support Requests VNE is responding to at such time.\n\n            2.8 Tracking Procedures. VNE will maintain procedures and systems designed to ensure that Problem Reports and Support Requests submitted by Converge are properly logged and tracked. In addition, VNE will provide to Converge a weekly status log of Problem Reports and Support Requests currently being tracked. Such report shall identify, as appropriate, each Problem Report or Support Request as submitted by Converge, the Severity Level for each identified Problem, the date and time each Problem Report or Support Request was received by VNE, an assessment of the Problem Report or Support Request and an action plan detailing the proposed method of resolution, and an estimated time schedule for delivery of any necessary Error corrections.\n\n            2.9 Remote Access. Converge shall provide VNE with remote access, via modem, the Internet or some other remote communications method mutually agreed-upon by the parties and subject to Converge's network security procedures and requirements, to Converge's servers on which the Supported Products are installed for the sole and limited purpose of enabling VNE to fulfill its obligation to provide Maintenance and Support Services hereunder. Converge shall be responsible for all costs associated with providing data network connectivity at the point of connectivity to Converge's data network. The parties will share equally in the cost of such connectivity between VNE's facilities and Converge's facilities (including all associated telecommunications charges). VNE shall not be responsible for any delay in providing Maintenance and Support Services under this Agreement to the extent such delay is due to Converge's adoption of unreasonable network security procedures or requirements.\n\n            2.10 Provision of Maintenance Updates. VNE shall provide Converge with Maintenance Updates as VNE makes them generally available to its other customers. Converge agrees to install in the recommend environments all Maintenance Updates within a reasonable time following the date they are provided by VNE, taking into consideration any testing and customization required by Converge (the parties expect that the time for such installation\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        5\n\ngenerally will not exceed 90 days). Should Converge find one or more material deficiencies in any Maintenance Update, Converge shall promptly identify such deficiencies to VNE in reasonable detail.\n\n            2.11 Method of Delivery. VNE will transfer to Converge all Maintenance Updates, and any associated Documentation, by remote telecommunications from the VNE place of business, to a Converge computer located at a Converge place of business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, if any. If any such Maintenance Update and/or associated Documentation cannot be delivered via remote telecommunications to a Converge computer located at a Converge place of business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, such Maintenance Update and/or Documentation will be installed by VNE on a Converge computer located at a Converge place of business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, if any. Converge will not obtain title or possession of any tangible personal property, including any storage media, as a result of the delivery of any Maintenance Update or associated Documentation under this Agreement.\n\n            2.12 Acceptance. Each Maintenance Update will be deemed accepted by Converge upon Converge's receipt of the complete delivery thereof to a Converge computer located at a Converge place of business.\n\n            2.13 License Rights. The scope of Converge's license rights to all Maintenance Updates shall be as set forth in the Subscription License Agreement. Except as may be set forth in the Subscription License Agreement, Converge acknowledges and agrees that Vert has no obligation to deliver Source Code for any Maintenance Update, or to grant Converge any license to use the Source Code form of any Maintenance Update.\n\n            2.14 Tracking of Maintenance Updates. VNE will maintain procedures and systems designed to ensure that all Maintenance Updates are compatible with previous versions of the Supported Products and any previously provided Maintenance Updates and Enhancements.\n\n            2.15 Modifications by Converge. Converge may notify VNE at least 10 Business Days in advance, through the Problem reporting process above, of Converge's desire to modify any Supported Product, or the hardware and other application and system software environment for any Supported Product. Within 10 Business Days of VNE's receipt of Converge's written notice, VNE will provide Converge with any recommendations that VNE may have as to how Converge should implement the desired modification. VNE shall have no responsibility for any Problems, Errors or other issues with respect to the Supported Products that are due to Converge's failure to ask for or follow any such recommendations of VNE.\n\n      3. Professional Services.\n\n            3.1 Project Managers. Each of Converge and VNE shall appoint a Project Manager to coordinate such party's activities with respect to the Professional Services hereunder. The initial VNE Project Manager shall be Michael Decker and the initial Converge Project Manager shall be Farooq Ahmad. Either party may change its Project Manager on notice (via e-mail or in some other reasonable fashion not necessarily in accordance with the express notice\n\n                                        6\n\nprovisions of this Agreement) to the other party's Project Manager and Relationship Manager at any time.\n\n            3.2 Monthly Work Plans. As reasonably requested by either party, the Converge Project Manager and the VNE Project Manager will conduct planning meetings to determine the Professional Services that VNE will provide to Converge for each month during the Term. In connection with each such planning meeting, the Converge Project Manager and the VNE Project Manager will jointly prepare a written work summary or plan (each, a \"Work Plan\") indicating the Professional Services to be performed by VNE for such month. The Work Plan shall identify those Professional Services that the Project Managers anticipate can be performed without causing VNE to materially exceed (on a pro-rata monthly basis for the given quarter, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing) the Quarterly Allocation for any quarter during the Term. All Professional Services that the Project Managers anticipate will cause VNE to materially exceed (on a pro-rata monthly basis for the given quarter, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing) the Quarterly Allocation shall either be separately identified in the applicable Work Plan or performed by VNE pursuant to a Statement of Work prepared in accordance with the following provisions of this Section 3. The Converge Project Manager and the VNE Project Manager may amend any Work Plan upon their written agreement at any time.\n\n            3.3 Training to Converge. VNE will provide, and the Work Plans will encompass as appropriate, VNE providing reasonable training and available training materials to enable Converge to provide Level 1 support for the Supported Products (\"Support Training\"). Support Training will include both introductory training reasonably in advance of when new Supported Products are put into production by Converge and periodic refreshers as appropriate when Maintenance Updates and Vert-General Release Enhancements are released. Support Training will be provided at mutually agreed locations and times.\n\n            3.4 Environment and Deployment Process. As part of the Professional Services provided by VNE, VNE will create a document entitled, \"Environment and Deployment Process.\" This document will detail the recommended Supported Product environments and the build and deployment process for the Supported Products.\n\n\n\n\n\nVNE agrees to complete a draft of this document for Converge's review within 30 days following the Effective Date. Converge agrees to review and provide final comments on this draft document within 30 days after receipt thereof. Both parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to reach a mutual agreement on the document and execute the final document within 90 days following the Effective Date.\n\n            3.5 Initial Request and Response. If Converge desires that VNE perform any Professional Services that the Project Managers anticipate would cause VNE to materially exceed (on a pro-rata monthly basis for the given quarter, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing) the Quarterly Allocation, Converge shall submit to VNE a written request for such Professional Services, which request shall detail the Professional Services being requested in reasonable detail. Within 45 days after VNE's receipt of Converge's request for VNE to perform any such Professional Services, VNE shall furnish to Converge a preliminary statement of work (including proposed pricing, which shall take into account any portion of such work that will be covered by a portion of the Quarterly Allocation) under which VNE would be willing to perform such Professional Services for Converge (each, a \"Proposed SOW\"). VNE may respond to\n\n                                        7\n\nseparate requests for Professional Services in a single Proposed SOW; provided, however, that the Proposed SOW will itemize the foregoing information separately for each of the requested Professional Services.\n\n            3.6 Finalization of Proposed SOWs. If Converge desires to have VNE provide any Professional Services under the terms of a Proposed SOW, Converge shall notify VNE thereof in writing. Should Converge wish to negotiate the terms of the Proposed SOW, the Converge Project Manager and the VNE Project Manager shall promptly and in good faith discuss and agree upon what revisions, if any, should be made to the Proposed SOW. Should the Converge Project Manager and the VNE Project Manager reach mutual agreement on such revisions, if any, the Proposed SOW shall be finalized and executed by both parties in writing (each, a \"Final SOW\").\n\n            3.7 Change Orders. Either party may request changes to a previously agreed upon Final SOW. In such event, VNE will inform Converge the impact of such changes. Changes to any Final SOW will be specified in a written change order or amendment to the Final SOW. Neither party shall be bound by any change order or amendment to a Final SOW unless and until such change order or amendment has been executed by both parties in writing.\n\n            3.8 Implementation. VNE will use commercially reasonable efforts to perform all Professional Services covered by a Work Plan or Final SOW in accordance with the schedule for performance of such Services set forth therein (or within a reasonable time, with due regard for the consequences of delayed performance, if no such schedule is set forth). Converge will reasonably cooperate with VNE in connection with its performance of such Professional Services as specified in the corresponding Work Plan or Final SOW and as may otherwise be reasonably requested by VNE. VNE shall not be liable for any default or delay in performance of such Professional Services to the extent the same is attributable to the failure of Converge to comply in any material respect with its obligations under this Agreement or any Work Plan or Final SOW.\n\n            3.9 Method of Delivery. VNE will transfer to Converge all Converge-Requested Enhancements to Converge, and any associated&bbsp;Documentation, by remote telecommunications from the VNE place of business, to a Converge computer located at a Converge place of business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, if any. If any such Converge-Requested Enhancement and/or associated Documentation cannot be delivered via remote telecommunications to a Converge computer located at a Converge place of business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, such Enhancement and/or Documentation will be installed by VNE on a Converge computer located at a Converge place of business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, if any. Converge will not obtain title or possession of any tangible personal property, including any storage media, as a result of the delivery of any Converge-Requested Enhancement or associated Documentation under this Agreement.\n\n            3.10 Acceptance. Each Converge-Requested Enhancement provided to Converge under a Final SOW will be subject to acceptance testing by Converge in accordance with the provisions of its corresponding Final SOW. All other Converge-Requested Enhancements provided to Converge under this Agreement will be deemed accepted by\n\n                                        8\n\nConverge upon Converge's receipt of the complete delivery thereof to a Converge computer located at a Converge place of business.\n\n            3.11 Ownership; License to Vert. Unless otherwise expressly stated in an applicable Work Plan or Final SOW, Vert shall be the sole and exclusive owner of all Converge-Requested Enhancements, but excluding any portions thereof that are or were developed independently by Converge or its Affiliates (\"Converge-Independent Materials\") and any portions thereof that are Converge Brand Features or Third-Party Materials. Except as the parties may otherwise agree in writing, Converge, to the extent it has the legal right to do so, hereby grants to Vert an irrevocable, perpetual, world-wide, non-exclusive right and license to use, load, store, transmit, execute, copy, market, distribute, in any medium or distribution technology whatsoever, known or unknown, display, perform and sublicense the Converge-Independent Materials and the Third-Party Materials, in both Source Code and Object Code formats, and to make unlimited\n\n\n\n\n\ninstantiations thereof, for any and all purposes. As used herein, \"Converge Brand Features\" means all logos, trademarks, service marks and trade names, brand names and other brand features of Converge and its licensors (other than Vert). As used herein, \"Third-Party Materials\" means any products or materials of third parties (including Converge's licensors and third-party contractors) to be incorporated into or provided as part of any Converge-Requested Enhancement. Converge shall use reasonable efforts to identify to VNE all relevant Third-Party Materials in the applicable Work Plan or Final SOW.\n\n            3.12 License Rights of Converge. The scope of Converge's license rights to each Converge-Requested Enhancement shall be as set forth in the Subscription License Agreement and, if relevant, the applicable Final SOW. Except as may be set forth in the Subscription License Agreement or as the parties may otherwise expressly agree in writing, Converge acknowledges and agrees that Vert has no obligation to deliver Source Code for any Converge-Requested Enhancement, or to grant Converge any license to use the Source Code form of any Converge-Requested Enhancement.\n\n            3.13 Installation and Configuration. Converge shall be responsible for installing and configuring any Converge-Requested Enhancements provided by VNE hereunder. Converge may request, and VNE will provide, reasonable assistance to Converge in its efforts to install and configure such Enhancements as part of the Professional Services provided hereunder.\n\n            3.14 Third-Party Technology. Except as the parties may otherwise expressly agree in writing, Converge shall be responsible for paying for and, with VNE's assistance, securing license rights to any third-party technology required for the provision or use of any Converge-Requested Enhancements provided under this Agreement. Vert shall use reasonable efforts to identify to Converge all required license rights to third-party technology in the applicable Work Plan or Final SOW.\n\n            3.15 Unforseen Costs and Expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3, neither party shall be obligated to incur any costs or expenses in connection with the performance or implementation of a Work Plan or Final SOW unless such Work Plan or Final SOW reasonably contemplates that such party shall be responsible for such costs or expenses, or such party otherwise agrees in writing to incur such costs and expenses.\n\n                                        9\n\n            3.16 Escalation Procedures. Should the Converge Project Manager and the VNE Project Manager be unable to reach agreement on any matter within the scope of their discretion under this Section 3, the matter shall be escalated to the parties' respective Relationship Managers for discussion. In addition, should either party believe that the other party has failed to fulfill its obligations under Section 2 or this Section 3 above, the matter shall be escalated to the parties' respective Relationship Managers for discussion. The initial VNE Relationship Manager shall be William Swank and the initial Converge Relationship Manager shall be Francesco DeMarchis. Either party may change its Relationship Manager on notice (via e-mail or in some other reasonable fashion not necessarily in accordance with the express notice provisions of this Agreement) to the other party's Project Manager and Relationship Manager at any time, except that the Relationship Manager always shall be at the director level or higher.\n\n      4. Fees and Payments.\n\n            4.1 Minimum Fee During Initial Term. Converge shall pay to VNE a minimum fee of Four and One-Half Million Dollars ($4,500,000) for VNE's provision of the Services during the Initial Term (the \"Initial Term Minimum Fee\"). Converge shall pay the Initial Term Minimum Fee to VNE in 18 equal installments of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) (each, a \"Monthly Installment\"). Converge shall pay the first such Monthly Installment to VNE on the date this Agreement is executed and delivered by both parties. Thereafter, Converge shall pay each such Monthly Installment to VNE no later than the first day of each month during the Initial Term (November 2001 and through March 2003). All such Monthly Installments are non-refundable.\n\n            4.2 Minimum Fee During Each Renewal Term. If the Parties mutually agree in writing to renew this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, the minimum fee payable by Converge to VNE during any such renewal period shall be as mutually determined by the Parties.\n\n            4.3 Application of Quarterly Allocation; Out-Of-Scope Services. For each quarter during the Term of this Agreement that Converge pays the applicable Monthly Installments, Converge shall be entitled to receive Services in an amount equal to the Quarterly Allocation; provided, however, that VNE shall provide all Maintenance and Support Services with respect to Problem Reports (but not with respect to Support Requests) reported during such quarter, and all Maintenance Updates released by VNE during such quarter, regardless of whether the provision of such Services would cause VNE to exceed the Quarterly Allocation for such quarter; and provided further, however, that if Converge fails to make a Monthly Installment when due (subject to the cure period in Section 9.2(c)), VNE shall not be required to provided additional Services during the remaining portion of the applicable quarter until such payment is made. Should Converge request and VNE provide any Professional Services, or any Maintenance and Support Services with respect to Support Requests, that would cause VNE to exceed the Quarterly Allocation for any quarter, then Converge shall pay VNE's then-current time charges, or such other charges as the parties may otherwise agree in any Final SOW (\"Out-Of-Scope Services\"), for such Out-Of-Scope Services. VNE shall use commercially reasonable efforts to inform Converge that any Professional Services requested by Converge would be Out-Of-Scope Services prior to VNE's performance of such Professional Services.\n\n\n\n\n\nConverge shall not be required to pay for and VNS shall not be required to perform any such Services that have not been approved in a Work Plan or Final SOW, or otherwise approved by Converge in writing.\n\n                                       10\n\n            4.4 Materials Costs and Expenses. Converge will reimburse VNE for all reasonable materials costs and expenses actually incurred by VNE in providing the Services under this Agreement, including travel and related expenses; provided, however, that VNE shall bear any travel or related expenses incurred by VNE at its sole option or as may be required in connection with the correction of any Error. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if travel is required due to the unavailability of remote access (see Section 2.9), then Converge shall reimburse VNE for the reasonable costs of such travel and related expenses. Upon Converge's request, the parties shall prepare budgets of any materials costs and expenses to be incurred by VNE in its performance of any Professional Services hereunder and any costs or expenses in excess of the applicable budgeted amounts shall be subject to Converge's written approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. VNE's invoices for all travel and related expenses shall be reasonably itemized and list all such expenses by category/person/trip, and be accompanied by reasonable documentation sufficient to support the deductibility by Converge of the reimbursable expense.\n\n            4.5 Invoicing and Payments. Converge shall pay the Monthly Installments to VNE on the dates specified in Section 4.1 and, if applicable, Section 4.2 above. All other amounts due under this Agreement will be invoiced by VNE to Converge on a monthly basis in arrears. All such invoiced amounts shall be due to VNE within 30 days following Converge's receipt of VNE's invoice. All payments will be made by Converge in U.S. dollars, without setoff, recoupment or deduction. All fees and other amounts not paid when due shall be subject to late charges of the lesser of (a) 1.5% per month of the overdue amount or (b) the maximum permitted under applicable law.\n\n            4.6 Taxes. The fees and other payments specified in this Agreement are exclusive of any sales, use and other taxes on consumption of goods and services (\"Sales Taxes\"), however designated or levied, based on this Agreement, delivery of the Services under this Agreement, or Converge's or its Affiliates' use thereof. In those jurisdictions in which VNE determines it is required to register, collect and remit Sales Taxes, VNE will separately invoice Converge for such Sales Taxes (which invoices shall be payable by Converge as set forth in Section 4.5), collect such Sales Taxes from Converge and remit such Sales Taxes to the proper taxing authority. In those jurisdictions in which VNE has determined that it does not have a collection responsibility, Converge will be required to self-assess and remit any Sales Taxes due on the purchase of taxable property and services acquired under this Agreement. Converge will retain ultimate responsibility and liability for remitting any Sales Taxes due on the purchase of any property and/or services acquired under this Agreement, including, without limitation, any interest, penalties or additions attributable to or imposed on or with respect to any such assessment excluding any taxes imposed upon the net income of either party). Subject to the express provisions of this Agreement, the parties will cooperate and use their commercially reasonable efforts to minimize or avoid, to the maximum extent allowed by law, the obligation to pay any Sales Taxes that may be levied on payments made under this Agreement or otherwise are chargeable by any applicable government authority with respect to the Services.\n\n            4.7 Tax Withholding. If laws, rules or regulations require withholding of any taxes imposed upon amounts payable to a party hereunder, the other party shall make such withholding payments as required and subtract such withholding payments from the amounts payable to such party. The other party shall submit reasonable proof of payment of the\n\n                                       11\n\nwithholding taxes to such party within 30 days after obtaining such proof. The parties agree to fully cooperate with each other, including, without limitation, in the filing of appropriate certificates of tax exemption, to ensure that any withholding payments required to be made by the other party are reduced or avoided to the fullest extent permitted by law. Converge shall be deemed to be the sole payor of payments owed to VNE under this Agreement and shall not have the right to substitute any domestic or foreign affiliate for that purpose, and if Converge reincorporates or otherwise reorganizes as a foreign person that would thereupon cause payments hereunder to VNE to become subject to withholding, then Converge shall comply with applicable laws to the extent required and shall gross up the payments otherwise owed to VNE so that VNE receives, net of withholding taxes, the amounts VNE would have received if Converge had not substituted a foreign person or had remained a domestic person.\n\n      5. Warranty.\n\n            5.1 Services Warranty. VNE warrants that the Services provided hereunder will be provided in accordance with generally-accepted industry standards applicable to the performance of services of a similar nature. In the event of any breach of the foregoing warranty, and provided that Converge reports such breach to VNE in writing within 90 days following the date of performance of the Services in question, VNE shall, as its sole obligation and Converge's sole and exclusive remedy, promptly repair, replace or re-perform the Services in question, without additional cost to Converge, so as to correct the warranty non-compliance as promptly as practicable (within 30 days to the extent technically feasible).\n\n            5.2 Disclaimer. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE EXPRESS WARRANTY PROVIDED\n\n\n\n\n\nIN SECTION 5.1 AND AS THE PARTIES MAY OTHERWISE AGREE IN ANY WORK PLAN, VNI AND ALL AFFILIATES OF VNI SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, ACCURACY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS RELATING TO ANY SERVICES, MAINTENANCE UPDATES OR ENHANCEMENTS PROVIDED OR TO BE PROVIDED HEREUNDER.\n\n      6. Limitation of Liability.\n\n            6.1 Disclaimer of Liability for Certain Damages.\n\n                  6.1.1 Consequential and Similar Damages. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE OR OBLIGATED IN ANY MANNER FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOST PROFITS, REVENUES OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES) HOWEVER CAUSED AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE PARTY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. The foregoing limitation\n\n                                       12\n\nis independent of any exclusive remedies available to either party under this Agreement, including any failure of such remedies.\n\n                  6.1.2 Loss of Data, Usage, Etc. VERT DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT ANY MAINTENANCE UPDATES OR ENHANCEMENTS WILL OPERATE WITHOUT ERROR OR INTERRUPTION AND VERT SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH LOSS OF DATA OR INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF USE OF ANY PRODUCTS, MAINTENANCE UPDATES OR ENHANCEMENTS RESULTING THEREFROM.\n\n            6.2 Sole Remedy. IF A CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO ANY MAINTENANCE UPDATE, ENHANCEMENT OR SERVICES PROVIDED OR TO BE PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE REMEDIES SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, TO THE EXCLUSION OF THE REMEDIES SET FORTH IN THE SUBSCRIPTION LICENSE AGREEMENT, SHALL CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO A PARTY FOR SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION. IF A CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A PRODUCT OR ANY SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER THE SUBSCRIPTION LICENSE AGREEMENT, THE REMEDIES SET FORTH IN THE SUBSCRIPTION LICENSE AGREEMENT, TO THE EXCLUSION OF THE REMEDIES SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, SHALL CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO A PARTY FOR SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION. For the sake of clarity, the parties acknowledge that claims concerning Vert's ownership of and Converge's license rights to any Maintenance Updates, Enhancements or associated Documentation shall be deemed to have arisen under the Subscription License Agreement, that claims with respect to VNE's delivery of any Vert-General Release Enhancements or associated Documentation, or the performance or non-performance of any Vert-General Release Enhancements, shall be deemed to have arisen under the Subscription License Agreement, and that claims with respect to VNE's delivery of any Maintenance Updates, Converge-Requested Enhancements or associated Documentation, or the performance or non-performance of any Maintenance Updates or Converge-Requested Enhancements, shall be deemed to have arisen under this Agreement. NO LIABILITY SHALL EXTEND UNDER THIS AGREEMENT TO ANY THIRD PARTY (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY AFFILIATES OF VNI OTHER THAN VNE, OR THEIR LICENSORS) IF NOT INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OR DELIVERY OF ANY MAINTENANCE UPDATE, ENHANCEMENT OR SERVICES HEREUNDER.\n\n            6.3 Maximum Aggregate Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF EACH PARTY TO THE OTHER OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR DAMAGES, IF ANY, RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY MAINTENANCE UPDATE, ENHANCEMENT OR SERVICES PROVIDED OR TO BE PROVIDED HEREUNDER, WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT OR WARRANTY, STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORT, STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY, THE FAILURE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY TO ACHIEVE ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT EXCEED (I) WITH RESPECT TO ANY ENHANCEMENT PROVIDED HEREUNDER, THE AMOUNTS PAID BY CONVERGE TO VERT FOR SUCH ENHANCEMENT, AND (II) WITH RESPECT TO ANY MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT SERVICES, THE AMOUNTS PAID BY\n\n                                       13\n\nCONVERGE TO VERT FOR SUCH MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT SERVICES DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH THE CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION FOR ANY SUCH DAMAGES FIRST AROSE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS ON EACH PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER SHALL BE IN ADDITION TO ANY FEES AND OTHER AMOUNTS DUE AND OWING UNDER SECTION 4. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION 6.3, THE TERM \"PARTY\" MEANS CONVERGE ON THE ONE HAND, AND VNI AND VNE COLLECTIVELY ON THE OTHER HAND, SO THAT AS TO VNI AND VNE THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 6.3 ARE COLLECTIVE LIMITATIONS AND NOT SEPARATE LIMITATIONS FOR EACH OF VNI AND VNE.\n\n            6.4 Exceptions. THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 6 SHALL NOT APPLY WITH RESPECT TO (A) ANY CLAIMS OF BODILY INJURY OR DAMAGE TO TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY RESULTING FROM WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE, (B) ANY BREACH OF THE CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS IN SECTION 7, OR (C) LIABILITY FOR PAYMENT OF INTEREST ADDED BY A COURT OF LAW OR AN ARBITRATION PANEL TO A JUDGMENT ENTERED IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n            6.5 Duty to Mitigate. Each party will have a duty to take reasonable steps to mitigate damages for which the other party is responsible.\n\n            6.6 Acknowledgement. Each of the parties acknowledge that the disclaimers and limitations set forth in this Section 6 are an essential element of this Agreement between the parties and that the parties would not have entered into this Agreement without such disclaimers and limitations.\n\n\n\n\n\n      7. Confidential Information.\n\n            7.1 Definition of Confidential Information. \"Confidential Information\" as used in this Agreement shall mean any and all proprietary or non-public information of a party whether in oral, written or other tangible form that the party disclosing the information (the \"Discloser\") designates as being confidential or which, under the circumstances surrounding disclosure, the receiving party (the \"Recipient\") knows or has reason to know should be treated as confidential.\n\n            7.2 Nondisclosure and Nonuse Obligations. Each of the parties, as Recipient, agrees that such Recipient will not use, disseminate, or in any way disclose any Confidential Information of the other party, as Discloser, to any person, firm or business, except to the extent necessary for the performance of such party's obligations or the enjoyment of such party's rights and benefits hereunder, and for any other purpose such Discloser may hereafter authorize in writing. Each of the parties, as Recipient, agrees that such Recipient shall treat all Confidential Information of the other party, as Discloser, with the same degree of care as such Recipient accords to such Recipient's own Confidential Information, but in no case less than reasonable care. Each of the parties, as Recipient, agrees&bbsp;that such Recipient shall disclose Confidential Information of the other party, as Discloser, only to those of such Recipient's employees who need to know such information, and such Recipient certifies that such Recipient employees have\n\n                                       14\n\npreviously agreed, either as a condition to employment or in order to obtain the Confidential Information of the Discloser, to be bound by terms and conditions substantially similar to those terms and conditions applicable to such Recipient under this Agreement. Each of the parties, as Recipient, shall immediately give notice to the other party, as Discloser, of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Discloser's Confidential Information. Each of the parties, as Recipient, agrees to assist the other party, as Discloser, in remedying any such unauthorized use or disclosure of Discloser's Confidential Information.\n\n            7.3 Exclusions from Nondisclosure and Nonuse Obligations. The obligations under this Section 7 of each of the parties, as Recipient, with respect to any portion of the Confidential Information of the other party, as Discloser, shall not apply to such portion that Recipient can document: (a) was in the public domain at or subsequent to the time such portion was communicated to Recipient by Discloser through no fault of Recipient; (b) was rightfully in Recipient's possession free of any obligation of confidence at or subsequent to the time such portion was communicated to Recipient by Discloser; (c) was developed by employees or agents of Recipient independently of and without reference to any information communicated to Recipient by Discloser; or (d) was communicated by Discloser to an unaffiliated third party free of any obligation of confidence. A disclosure by either of the parties, as Recipient, of Confidential Information of the other party, as Discloser, either (i) in response to a valid order by a court or other governmental body; (ii) as otherwise required by law; or (iii) as necessary to establish the rights of either party under this Agreement, shall not be considered to be a breach of this Agreement by Recipient or a waiver of confidentiality for other purposes; provided, however, that Recipient shall provide prompt prior written notice thereof to Discloser to enable Discloser to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent such disclosure.\n\n            7.4 Confidentiality of this Agreement. The parties hereto agree to keep the terms of this Agreement confidential and not to divulge any part thereof to any third party except: (a) with the prior written consent of the other party; (b) to any governmental body having jurisdiction to request and to read the same; (c) as otherwise may be required by law or legal process; or (d) to legal counsel representing either party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no disclosure of this Agreement shall be made pursuant to clauses (b) or (c) of the foregoing sentence without the disclosing party first giving the other party reasonable notice prior to the intended disclosure so as to allow the other party sufficient time to seek a protective order or otherwise assure the confidentiality of this Agreement as that other party shall deem appropriate. Each party agrees not to file this Agreement as an exhibit to its SEC filings without first redacting and requesting confidential treatment for any information reasonably considered by the other party to be confidential. Such other party shall inform the first party of any such information it wishes to redact and request confidential treatment for within five Business Days following the date such other party is requested to do so in writing. Nothing herein shall prohibit either party from complying with applicable securities or other laws, rules or regulations.\n\n      8. Non-Solicitation. During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of one year thereafter, Converge and Vert each agree not to directly or indirectly solicit, encourage or cause others to solicit or encourage any employees or individual independent contractors of the other party to terminate their employment or independent contracting relationship with the other party and become an employee or independent contractor of the soliciting party or its Affiliate. This provision does not prohibit a party's responding to unsolicited employment inquiries and/or any\n\n                                       15\n\nindirect solicitations and other employment activities (e.g., job postings, advertising of positions) that are not specifically targeted at any particular individual.\n\n\n\n\n\n      9. Term; Events of Default; and Termination.\n\n            9.1 Term. The initial period of this Agreement (the \"Initial Term\") shall commence upon the Effective Date and continue until March 31, 2003. Thereafter, this Agreement shall renew only upon the mutual written agreement of the parties for up to three additional renewal terms of one year each (each, a \"Renewal Term\"). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.1, in the event any Services or other obligations of either party (including payment obligations) with respect to any Final Work Plan have not been completed or discharged as of the date on which this Agreement would otherwise expire, this Agreement shall remain in effect solely with respect to such Work Plan until such Services or other obligations have been completed or discharged.\n\n            9.2 Events of Default. The occurrence of any one or more of the following acts, events or occurrences shall constitute an \"Event of Default\" under this Agreement: (a) either party becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy or is subjected to involuntary bankruptcy proceedings that are not dismissed within 60 days, or makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (b) either party breaches any material provision of this Agreement and the result is the non-breaching party experiencing a substantial deprivation of the benefits to which the non-breaching party is entitled under this Agreement, which material breach is not cured by the breaching party within 30 days after the breaching party's receipt of the non-breaching party's written notice specifying the breach in detail; provided, however, that if the breach is of such a nature that it may be cured, but it may not reasonably be cured within such 30-day period, the non-breaching party may not terminate this Agreement unless such breach is not cured by the breaching party on or before the 60th day after the breaching party's receipt of the non-breaching party's notice of breach if breaching party has commenced substantial efforts to cure the breach within the initial 30-day period and has continued in good faith to work to cure the breach as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, or (c) Converge fails to pay when due any amounts payable under Section 4 and fails to cure such breach within 3 Business Days after VNE gives Converge written notice specifying the breach.\n\n            9.3 Termination. Immediately upon the occurrence of an Event of Default by either party, the other party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to terminate this Agreement, exercisable by such other party giving written notice thereof to first party within 10 Business Days after the occurrence of such Event of Default. In addition, this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon any termination of the Subscription License Agreement as permitted thereunder.\n\n            9.4 Effect of Termination. Upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement, each party shall erase, destroy or return to the other party all copies of the Confidential Information of or provided by such party under this Agreement and, upon such other party's written request, shall certify its compliance with this Section 9.4 to the other party in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.4, with respect to and for so long as any licenses granted to Converge respecting Deployed Products and/or Source Code under the Subscription License Agreement survive the expiration or termination of this\n\n                                       16\n\nAgreement, Converge shall not be required to erase, destroy or return any Confidential Information of Vert or its Affiliates respecting such Deployed Products and/or Source Code.\n\n            9.5 Effect of Vert Non-Renewal Election. If VNE or VNI is unwilling to renew this Agreement on its existing terms for any Renewal Term, a \"Vert Non-Renewal Election\" shall be deemed to have occurred. In the event of a Vert-Non-Renewal Election, in addition to any rights or remedies that may be available to Converge under the Subscription License Agreement, the provisions of Section 8 above shall cease to apply with respect to Converge's solicitation or encouragement of any of the VNE Service Personnel to terminate their employment or independent contracting relationship with VNE and become an employee or independent contractor of Converge or its Affiliate.\n\n            9.6 Effect of Converge Non-Renewal Election. If VNE or VNI is willing to renew this Agreement on its existing terms for any Renewal Term, but Converge elects not to renew this Agreement for any for any reason, a \"Converge Non-Renewal Election\" shall be deemed to have occurred. In the event of a Converge-Non-Renewal Election, the rights or remedies that may be available to Converge under the Subscription License Agreement, if any, shall apply.\n\n            9.7 Survival. Sections 3.11, 3.12, 4.1, 4.2, 4.6, 4.7, 5.2, 6, 7, 8, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7 and 10 shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement. In addition, all payment obligations under Section 5 that pertain to Services provided or otherwise accrue prior to the effective date of expiration or termination of this Agreement shall survive such expiration or termination.\n\n      10. General.\n\n            10.1 Notices. All notices permitted or required under this Agreement (\"Notices\") shall be in writing and shall be delivered as follows with notice deemed given as indicated (a) by personal delivery when delivered personally; (b) by overnight courier upon written verification of receipt; or (c) by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, five days after deposit in the mail. All Notices shall be properly addressed as follows, or to such other addresses as may be specified in a Notice given hereunder:\n\nIf to VNI or VNE:                         with a copy to:\n\n\n\n\n\nAttn: General Counsel                     Attn: Michael L.

Four Technology Drive Peabody, MA  01960\n\n            10.2 Force Majeure. Except for the obligation to pay monies due, neither party shall be liable hereunder by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder (except for the payment of money) on account of strikes, riots, insurrection, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, governmental action, labor conditions, earthquakes, or any other cause which is beyond the control of such party.\n\n            10.3 Waiver. An effective waiver under this Agreement must be in writing signed by the party waiving its right. The failure of either party to require performance by the other party of any provision hereof shall not affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter; nor shall the waiver by either party of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of subsequent breaches of that or any other provision hereof.\n\n            10.4 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or be so held by applicable court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and, in such event, such provision shall be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such provisions within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.\n\n            10.5 Headings. The section headings appearing in this Agreement are inserted only as a matter of convenience and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section or in any way affect such section.\n\n          &sbsp; 10.6 Choice of Law; Waiver of Jury Trial; Limitation of Action. This Agreement and performance under this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the United States of America and of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within Pennsylvania between Pennsylvania residents, excluding its conflicts of law provisions.

The adverse impact of a             Severity 1 Problem on Converge's business is severe and immediate,             and requires an immediate solution. A \"Severity Level 1\" Problem may             have one or more of the following characteristics, in each case             without Converge being able to implement a reasonable workaround:\n\n            -     Data is corrupted or lost by the Supported Product, or the                   Supported Product returns incorrect results, and such                   corruption, loss or incorrect results have a material adverse                   impact on critical or central functionality of the Supported                   Product             -     Complete or severe lack of ability to use the critical or                   central functionality of the Supported Product             -     The Supported Product crashes repeatedly             -     Critical or central functionality of the Supported Product is                   not operational or is severely degraded             -     Critical or central functionality of the Supported Product                   fails to run to completion\n\n2           A \"Severity Level 2\" Problem is one where critical or central             functionality of the Supported Product is unavailable, or             performance of critical or central functionality of the Supported             Product is severely degraded, but in either such case Converge can             implement a reasonable workaround but such workaround does not             downgrade the Problem to Severity Level 3 or 4. Use of critical or             central functionality of the Supported Product can continue in a             restricted fashion through use of such workaround, but the user             still experiences a significant degradation of performance of such             functionality. A \"Severity Level 2\" Problem may have one or more of             the characteristics of a \"Severity Level 1\" Problem, but critical or             central functionality of\n\n            -     the Supported Product can continue to operate in a restricted                   fashion through use of such workaround.\n\n3           A \"Severity Level 3\" Problem causes minimal interruption to             non-central or non-important functionality. The Problem has a minor             impact or is inconvenient. A \"Severity Level 3\" Problem may have one             or more of the following characteristics:\n\n            -     Performance of the Supported Product is degraded in a                   non-critical manner             -     Performance of the Supported Product is minimally impaired\n\n\n\n\n\n                                       21\n\n          4           A \"Severity Level 4\" Problem causes no loss of use of the Supported             Product. The following would be \"Severity Level 4\" Problems:\n\n            -     Cosmetic problem with the Supported Product             -     Documentation error             -     Minor incorrect behavior of the Supported Product that does                   not impede its operation\n\n                                       22\n\n                                    Exhibit B                      Problem Response and Resolution Efforts\n\nSEVERITY        RESPONSE TIME AND STATUS REPORTS               RESOLUTION EFFORTS  LEVEL                                                              1            -   \"Initial Response\" (defined                -   Continuous efforts (24x7) with                     below) within 30 minutes after                 best available resources to                     the Problem is reported to VNE                 provide a workaround, patch,                     if the Problem is reported                     fix or other solution for the                     during Support Hours.

Such price lists will be subject to  change from time to time in Accuray's sole discretion, and Accuray shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide  Distributor with updated pricing on a regular basis, provided that pricing included in a Quote delivered by Accuray to  Distributor shall reflect Accuray's current up-to-date pricing unless otherwise agreed.

Quote. Following receipt of Distributor's Quote request, Accuray will determine whether to approve the issuance of a Quote  related to such request. Such determination shall be made in accordance with and subject to the conditions set forth in  Schedule 2.3.2 attached hereto. If Accuray approves the issuance of a Quote, Accuray shall issue a Quote to Distributor  based on the Product configuration and Services requested by the Customer, including pricing for such Products and  Services as provided in Section 2.2 above. The Quote issued by Accuray in relation to a Customer opportunity shall serve  as the basis of any offer made by Distributor to that Customer and shall remain valid for at least six months (unless earlier  declined by Distributor), and Distributor shall submit an amended Quote request to Accuray in the event adjustments to a  Quote are requested by the Customer. Any such amended Quote request from Distributor shall again be subject to the  Accuray approval process set forth in this Section 2.3.2.     3\n\n\n\n\n\n     2.3.3. Purchase. To purchase Products or Services based on a Quote provided by Accuray, Distributor will issue a purchase order,  which shall include specific references to the quote number of such Quote (the \"Purchase Order\"). Accuray shall either  accept or reject such Purchase Order within two weeks after receipt thereof, with any failure to approve or disapprove of  such Purchase Order in such period constituting disapproval. Each purchase of Accuray Components and Interfaces shall  be accomplished and a Purchase Order may be accepted by the execution of the Purchase Order by an authorized  representative of Accuray. To the extent of any inconsistency between the Quote and the related Purchase Order, the  terms and conditions of such Quote shall govern and Distributor acknowledges and agrees that Accuray shall not be  bound by any terms, conditions or boilerplate language included in a Distributor purchase order submitted to Accuray.  The Purchase Order shall be delivered to Accuray via fax, electronic mail, or mail at the following address:     Accuray Incorporated  ATTN: Contracts Administration  1310 Chesapeake Terrace  Sunnyvale, CA 94089  Main: (408) 716-4600  Fax: (408) 789-4205  Email: Orders@accuray.com     2.3.4. Cancellation; Amendment; Conflict. Distributor may cancel the Purchase Order if Accuray has not executed such Purchase  Order within two weeks of receipt. Any amendment or addition to the Purchase Order shall only be effective if Distributor  and Accuray confirm such amendment or addition in writing. To the extent of any inconsistency between a Quote or a  Purchase Order and this Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail, unless such Quote or Purchase Order is signed by both  the CFO or General Counsel of Accuray and the CFO of Distributor, expressly refers to this Section 2.3.4, and states that  the Quote or Purchase Order is intended to supersede this Agreement.     2.4.

Distributor will develop a thorough and complete understanding of the Products and  Services. Distributor will use its knowledge and understanding to identify and cultivate potential Customers. Distributor agrees to  use commercially reasonable efforts to introduce, promote the sale of, and obtain orders for the Products and Services in connection  with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases, including, without limitation, including the Products and Services in each of  Distributor's      4\n\n\n\n\n\n     Oncology Care Systems price book and sales operation system, such that all of Distributor's sales representatives can access  quotations for Products and Services at least as easily as all other systems then available for purchase from Distributor.

Purchase Schedule. For each sale completed by Distributor, the resulting contract for the sale of Products shall be between Distributor  and the Customer and the Service Agreement, if any, shall be between Accuray and the Customer or Accuray and the Distributor, as  determined pursuant to Section 4.8. For each such sale, Distributor must send a Purchase Order to Accuray at least six (6) months  prior to the expected shipment date.     3.7. Customer Complaints. Distributor shall report promptly and in writing to Accuray any complaints or expressions of dissatisfaction by  the Customers to Distributor relating to the Products or Services. Any such reports shall be provided to Accuray via electronic mail  to the following address: complaints@accuray.com.     3.8. Warranty. Distributor will not make any warranties or representations in Accuray's name or on Accuray's behalf other than the  warranty provided by Accuray pursuant to Section 4.6 unless approved in advance in writing by Accuray.     3.9. Service Agreements. Distributor will make commercially reasonable efforts to sell a Service Agreement to each Customer. For the  avoidance of doubt, (i) the obligations of the parties with respect to the Service Agreement are as set forth in Sections 3.6 and 4.8  and (ii) the failure of Distributor to sell a Service Agreement to any Customer shall not be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement.     3.10. Upgrades. Any Product upgrades released by Accuray (other than Bug Fixes and Safety Updates, which are addressed in Section  4.6.3 and 4.6.4 respectively) can be purchased at the discretion of the Distributor pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 2.3.  Such      5\n\n\n\n\n\n     upgrades will be available at the prices listed in the then current price list as of the date of the Quote (unless prior written approval  by Accuray for application of an earlier price list is obtained) for the upgrade, less any applicable discounts as specified in Exhibit A  hereto.     3.11. Compliance with Laws.     3.11.1. Compliance Generally. Distributor has and will have during the Term of this Agreement and any extension thereof the ability  to distribute, market and sell the Products and Services in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, in full compliance  with all governmental, regulatory and other requirements under any applicable law. Furthermore, Distributor agrees to  comply with all applicable international, national, regional and local laws applicable to the performance of its duties  hereunder or to any transactions involving the Products or Services contemplated hereunder.     3.11.2. United States Laws. Distributor understands that, because it is distributing the Products and Services of Accuray, a  corporation subject to the laws of the United States of America, Distributor must, when carrying out its duties pursuant to  this Agreement, avoid violations of certain of such laws. These include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:     3.11.2.1. Restrictive Trade Practices or Boycotts, U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Title 15, Chapter VII, Part 760.     3.11.2.2. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.S. Code Title 15, \u00a7 78.     3.11.2.3.

Neither party (nor their sub-distributors, if any (\"Sub-Distributors\")) shall engage in any illegal activities.  A party will not be held responsible for any activities of the other party or the other party's Sub-Distributors that may be  considered to be illegal. For example, neither party supports the practice of bribes or under-the-table payments. Each party  will ensure a like clause is included in each agreement it has with its Sub-Distributors, and monitor activities of its Sub- Distributors closely. In the event a party deems that its good-will has been or may potentially be affected by any such  illegal activity of the other party or the other party's Sub-Distributors, then such party reserves the right to terminate this  Agreement or any portion thereof that relates to or is materially affected by such illegal activity with no further liability to  the other party or the other party's Sub-Distributors. Such party assumes no liability for such illegal activity and the other  party hereby indemnifies and holds such party, its officers and assigns, harmless from any loss, damage and liability  arising from or in connection with such illegal activity.     3.12. Sales Targets. Distributor shall not be subject to any minimum purchase requirements, but shall agree to the annual sales targets set  forth in Schedule 2.5(d)(i)(2) of the Strategic Alliance Agreement and to using its customary standard sales processes, including,  without limitation, the MTA process, with respect to sales of Systems.     6\n\n\n\n\n\n     3.13. Affiliates; Distributors. Siemens shall cause any of its Affiliates or distributors purchasing Systems or Services pursuant to the terms  of this Agreement to agree to be bound by and comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the provisions of the  Strategic Alliance Agreement related to or applicable to such purchase, unless such Affiliate or distributor is already party to a  distribution agreement for Products with Accuray.     4. DUTIES OF ACCURAY     4.1. Fulfillment and Shipment.     4.1.1. Fulfillment of Executed Purchase Orders. Accuray is responsible for ensuring that the Products supplied are of good quality as  further described below. Accuray will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Distributor or Customer, as  applicable, in a timely manner those Products and Services required to fill confirmed Purchase Orders received from  Distributor in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.     4.1.2. Shipment. All shipments shall be made F.C.A. Port of Oakland, California, USA. Transfer of risk from Accuray to Distributor  shall occur at such F.C.A. location as provided in F.C.A. terms and transfer of title shall occur at the same time. Distributor  may request Accuray to use a particular freight carrier, and Accuray agrees to do so, if feasible. If not feasible in Accuray's  reasonable judgment, then Accuray shall promptly advise Distributor of the reasons. If no such request is made, Accuray  shall ship in accordance with any instructions contained in the Purchase Order or via FedEx ground, with no extra  insurance. Accuray shall bill any actual freight costs to Distributor. Any supplementary shipping costs arising from the  need to meet the delivery deadline set forth in the Purchase Order by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by Accuray,  if such delivery deadline was at least six months after the submission of such Purchase Order by Distributor. For example, if  a Purchase Order was submitted on June 1, with a requested delivery date of December 1, any expedited delivery expenses  required in order to ensure delivery by December 1 shall be borne by Accuray, while if the requested delivery date was  October 1, any expedited delivery expenses required in order to ensure delivery by October 1 shall be borne by Distributor.     4.2. Product and Service Pricing. Accuray will provide its then current U.S. list pricing for its Products and Services to Siemens once per  year during the Term of this Agreement and any extension thereof, or upon request from Siemens. All prices will be stated in US  Dollars, unless another currency is agreed upon in writing by Accuray.     4.3. Product Specifications and Promotional Literature. Accuray will provide product specifications and promotional literature to Distributor  from time to time during the Term of this Agreement and any extension thereof. Distributor may use product specifications and  promotional literature in Distributor's dealings with Customers. Accuray may introduce changes and upgrades to the Products.

Accuray will be responsible for and will bear all expenses related to obtaining and maintaining any approvals,  permits and licenses required under any applicable law in order to sell, market and distribute the Products and Services to a  Customer in      7\n\n\n\n\n\n     connection with Multiple LINAC or Multi-Modality Purchases, including any upgrades to or expanded usage of the Products;  provided, however, that if Accuray does not have a direct presence in or Accuray does not have a distributor for the sales of  Systems specifically for the country in which the Customer requests delivery, as a condition to any sale of Products or Services to  such Customer, Accuray may require Distributor (solely with the consent of Distributor) to enter into a distribution agreement with  Accuray pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Strategic Alliance Agreement providing, among other things, that Distributor will be  responsible for obtaining all such approvals, permits, and licenses for sales to such Customer. Distributor will provide any  assistance or documentation reasonably requested by Accuray and at Accuray's expenses to assist Accuray with its obligations  under this Section 4.4. Accuray will be registered as the sole owner of any rights, title and interest to any of the Products or Spare  Parts, as the case may be; provided, however, that should any applicable law or regulation require that Distributor alone be entitled  to such ownership rights, Distributor shall hold this approval as trustee for Accuray and hereby consents to transfer or sublicense  such approval to Accuray free of charge or to support Accuray in its efforts to re-obtain the approval for the benefit of Accuray or a  third party named by Accuray upon expiration or termination of this Agreement. Lists indicating, as of the Effective Date, (i) the  countries in which Accuray has obtained regulatory approvals for the Products and Services and (ii) the countries in which Accuray  has a direct presence or has a distributor for the sales of Systems specifically for such country are being delivered to Siemens  concurrently with the execution of this Agreement.

Accuray or its distributor will obtain and maintain all required import licenses, and shall serve as importer of record for  all Products and Services delivered in or into any country or region, other than the United States, pursuant to this Agreement;  provided, however, that if Accuray does not have a direct presence in or Accuray does not have a distributor specifically for the  sales of Systems in the country in which the Customer requests delivery, as a condition to any sale of Products or Services to such  Customer, Accuray may require Distributor (solely with the consent of Distributor) to enter into a distribution agreement with  Accuray pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Strategic Alliance Agreement providing, among other things, that Distributor will obtain and  maintain all required import licenses and will act as the importer of record for the Products and Services ordered by such Customer.     4.6. Warranty.     4.6.1. Scope of Warranty. Accuray will provide a warranty to each Customer that the Products will be free from material defects and  perform substantially in accordance with the written Specifications provided by Accuray as reflected in the regulatory  clearance at the time of sale for a period of one (1) year following Installation of the Products at Customer's facility, but not  to exceed eighteen (18) months following shipment of such Products to Distributor (\"Warranty Period\"). \"Installation\" of  the System shall occur upon completion by Accuray or the entity installing the System, as applicable, of Accuray's  acceptance test procedure demonstrating that the System substantially conforms to the written Specifications. If Accuray  does not perform the Installation, Distributor will notify Accuray in writing within ten (10) days following Installation  (including any testing procedures undertaken by Customer or its installation service provider). In no event shall  Distributor, Customer or their respective agents use the System (or any portion thereof) for any purpose before Installation  thereof without the express written approval of Accuray. Distributor      8\n\n\n\n\n\n     shall indemnify and hold Accuray harmless from any such use. Accuray makes no warranty that the operation of any  software will be uninterrupted or error-free. Except as set forth in the preceding sentences, Accuray makes no warranties or  representations to Customers or to any other party regarding any Products or Services provided by Accuray. TO THE  FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ACCURAY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND  REPRESENTATIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED  WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES  ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.     4.6.2. Hardware and Software. If a Customer notifies Accuray in writing during the Warranty Period of a defect in a Product that  causes the Product to fail to conform to the foregoing warranty, Accuray shall at its option either repair or replace the non- conforming Product or, if in Accuray's opinion such repair or replacement is not commercially reasonable, Accuray shall  refund a pro-rated portion of the price paid by the Customer for such Product calculated based on a straight-line  depreciation over a 5-year period beginning on the date of delivery. This will be Accuray's sole and exclusive obligation  and such Customer's sole and exclusive remedy in relation to defective Products and parts.     4.6.3. Software and Bug Fixes. Notwithstanding Section 4.6.2, for a period of 10 years following Installation of a System, Accuray will  provide to Customer, without charge, Bug Fixes with respect to any software included in the System. This is Accuray's  sole and exclusive obligation and Customer's and Distributor's sole and exclusive remedy in relation to defective software.  By way of clarification, Accuray's sole obligation shall be to make such Bug Fixes available to Customer, and Accuray  shall have no obligation (unless otherwise agreed by the Customer and Accuray) for installation or implementation of such  Bug Fixes at the Customer's site. \"Bug Fix\" means an error correction or minor change in the existing software and/or  hardware configuration that is required in order to enable the existing software and/or hardware configuration to perform to  the existing functional specification(s).     4.6.4. Safety Updates. Notwithstanding Section 4.6.2 and any obligations according to law, for a period of 10 years following  Installation of a System, Accuray will provide to Customer, without charge, Safety Updates with respect to any hardware or  software included in the System. This is Accuray's sole and exclusive obligation and Customer's and Distributor's sole  and exclusive remedy in relation to any Safety Update required to be provided by applicable law in the Customer's  jurisdiction. By way of clarification, Accuray's sole obligation shall be to make such Safety Update available to Customer,  and Accuray shall have no obligation (unless otherwise agreed by the Customer and Accuray) for installation or  implementation of such Safety Update at the Customer's site. \"Safety Update\" means an error correction or change in the  existing software and/or hardware configuration that is required for safety in order to enable the existing software and/or  hardware configuration to perform to the existing functional specification(s) in accordance with applicable law in the  Customer's jurisdiction.     4.6.5. Warranty Exclusions. All warranty replacement of Products and parts shall be limited to malfunctions which are due and  traceable to defects in original material or workmanship of Products. The warranties set forth in this Section 4.6 shall be  void      9\n\n\n\n\n\n     and of no further effect in the event of abuse, accident, alteration, misuse or neglect of Products, including but not limited  to user modification of the operating environment specified by Accuray and user modification of any software.     4.6.6. Warranty Basis. Any limitation of liability under any warranty contained herein shall be an integral part of such warranty,  which limits its scope (Section 444, second alternative German Civil Code shall not apply). Any limitation of liability for any  defects contained herein shall be void insofar as Accuray has intentionally failed to disclose such defect.     4.7. Installation. Unless otherwise agreed by Accuray and Distributor (including, without limitation, pursuant to the terms of any  distribution agreement entered into pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Strategic Alliance Agreement), Accuray shall be responsible for  installation of Accuray Products at Customer sites.     4.8. Service Agreements. Accuray will provide its then current Service Agreements to Distributor from time to time during the Term of this  Agreement and any extension thereof, or upon request from Distributor. All prices will be stated in US Dollars, unless another  currency is agreed upon in writing by Accuray. Such Service Agreements are to be offered to the Customer on the terms as set forth  in those agreements, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by an authorized representative of Accuray. Accuray shall execute a  Service Agreement with the Customer upon receipt of (i) a copy of such Service Agreement executed by the Customer, and (ii) any  payments then due under such Service Agreement; provided, however, that Accuray shall have no obligation to enter into such  Service Agreement if it materially deviates from the form Service Agreement provided to Distributor; provided, further, that if  Accuray does not have a direct presence in or Accuray does not have a distributor for the sales of Systems specifically for the  country in which the Customer requests Services, as a condition to any sale of Services to such Customer, Accuray may require  Distributor (solely with the consent of Distributor) to enter into a distribution agreement with Accuray pursuant to Section 3.2 of the  Strategic Alliance Agreement providing, among other things, that Distributor may (at its sole discretion) enter into such Service  Agreement with such Customer and will provide directly to such Customer the Services required to be performed under such Service  Agreement. If Accuray enters into such Service Agreement with such Customer, Accuray will be responsible for and will provide to  such Customer (either directly or through one or more of its distributors) the services required to be performed under such Service  Agreement.     4.9. Customer Training. If training of Customer's personnel is included in a Purchase Order confirmed by Accuray, Accuray will provide  such training in accordance with Accuray's then current training offerings and will coordinate with the Customer in order to provide  such training at Accuray's facility in Sunnyvale, California (or such other facility as may be agreed upon by Customer and  Accuray). For the purposes of such training, Accuray will be responsible for the travel and accommodation expenses of its  personnel, while Customer shall be responsible for the travel and accommodation expenses of its personnel. All Customer training  provided by Accuray will be conducted in English and, to the extent a Customer or its personnel do not have adequate English  language reading and comprehension skills, Accuray will provide an interpreter and translation services sufficient to enable the  Customer and its personnel to meaningfully and effectively participate in Accuray training courses.     10\n\n      4.10.

Distributor Personnel Sales Training. Accuray shall provide training of Distributor's sales personnel responsible for sales of Products  and Services to Distributor free of charge. Such training shall be at the times, in such locations, and in the scope agreed upon by  Distributor and Accuray in good faith; provided, however, that such training shall be provided to such Distributor personnel in  each Accuray Region at least once per year. Each party shall be responsible for all costs and expenses, including travel and lodging,  incurred by it or its personnel to attend or provide such training. Accuray will provide additional training to Distributor's personnel  as may be reasonably requested by Distributor on a time and materials basis according to Accuray's then current price lists.     4.13. Support of Distributor's Efforts. Accuray shall, at its own expense:     4.13.1. assign a dedicated marketing point of contact for Distributor's marketing and sales personnel, which employee may be based  at any of Distributor's facilities as requested by the Steering Committee; and     4.13.2. provide global sales and marketing support, including support for individual sales opportunities, to Distributor; provided,  however, that the scope, duration, location, availability, and timing of such support shall be subject to commercially  reasonable limits and shall be determined pursuant to Section 3.3(a)(iii) of the Strategic Alliance Agreement.     4.14. Compliance with Laws. Accuray will be responsible for complying with (i) applicable U.S. laws, (ii) where Products are being shipped  to Distributor and unless otherwise agreed by Accuray and Distributor, applicable laws, codes, registrations, regulations, and  ordinances related to the export of the Products to Distributor, and (iii) any other applicable laws as they pertain to the Products, the  regulatory clearance, and safety in accordance with Accuray's written Specifications for the intended use.

Accuray shall advise Distributor in writing within two weeks of the confirmation of the  Purchase Order of any information or data required by Accuray to comply with an Export Regulation, including without limitation:\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) All applicable export list numbers, including the Export Control      11\n\n\n\n\n\n     Classification Number according to the U.S. Commerce Control List (ECCN);     (b) The statistical commodity code according to the current commodity classification for foreign trade statistics and the  HS (Harmonized System) coding;     (c) The country of origin (non-preferential origin); and     (d) Accuray's declaration of preferential origin (in case of European suppliers) or preferential certificates (in case of  non-European suppliers).     4.15.

Distributor shall receive a commission in the amount specified in Exhibit A hereto for any  Service Agreement entered into by Accuray with Customer pursuant to Section 4.8.     5.2.2. All costs of delivering the Products to the Distributor or Customer (including, but not limited to, costs for land, air and/or  ocean freight, insurance, port, customs and forwarding fees, if any), as well as any rigging and unloading of the Products,  shall be paid as provided in the F.C.A. terms. Unless advised otherwise, all prices quoted by Accuray include the cost of  packing and crating for delivery.     5.2.3. Taxes. By way of clarification, all Accuray prices referenced in this Agreement, and all other amounts payable by Distributor to Accuray pursuant to this Agreement are net of any value added tax or federal, state, county or municipal sales or use tax,  excise or similar charge, withholding tax, or other tax assessment (except for any taxes that are assessed against income)  (collectively, the \"Taxes\"). The parties agree that it is their intention that Accuray will not bear any economic burden  relating to the Taxes. Subject to the foregoing and to compliance with applicable laws, Accuray and Distributor agree to  cooperate with each other as reasonably requested to establish the responsibilities of the parties relating to the payment  and withholding of Taxes, filing of documents, and other matters in order to achieve an efficient tax result.     5.3. Compensation. Except as otherwise provided herein, Distributor's only compensation for its efforts on Accuray's behalf shall be the  margins it earns on the resale of Products and      12\n\n\n\n\n\n     commissions on sales of Services, and Distributor shall bear all of the expenses which it incurs in making those efforts.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Accuray does not approve the issuance of a Quote to a potential Customer and  later contracts directly (or through one of its distributors) with such potential Customer, of which Accuray shall inform Distributor  without undue delay, Distributor shall receive credit for any sales of Systems to such potential Customer pursuant to and subject to  the fulfillment of the conditions set forth in Section 3.4 of the Strategic Alliance Agreement.     5.4.

Past due balances on any reasonably  undisputed amount shall bear interest at the rate of 0.5% per month or, if lower, the maximum amount permitted by  applicable law. If Distributor is a \"business person\" (as defined in \u00a7 14 of the German Civil Code, \"BGB\"), the payment shall  be deemed past due only if Distributor fails to pay in response to a payment demand note received after payment becomes  due.     5.4.1.1.

An irrevocable trade finance letter of credit issued by Distributor's bank, confirmed by a bank  designated by Accuray in all respects and delivered to Accuray upon the acceptance of the Purchase Order  by Accuray.

The remaining balance is due net 30 days after delivery by Accuray at the specified F.C.A. location  pursuant to Section 4.1.2 and receipt by Distributor of a reasonably undisputed invoice.     5.4.1.3.

Should Customers make such payments to Accuray and  such payment include the Distributor's margin, then Accuray will pay such margin to Distributor once payment is received  from the Customer and cleared by Accuray's designated bank.     5.5. Collections. Notwithstanding Section 5.4.3 above, Distributor shall be solely responsible for determining the creditworthiness of and  collecting payment from its Customers. The risk of non-collection from the Customer will be borne entirely by Distributor, which  shall be responsible for making timely payment to Accuray for Products whether or not Distributor is successful in collecting from  its Customer. In the event that full payment is not received by Accuray, Accuray shall not be liable to Distributor for any margin or  commission unless and until it has received payment of amounts sufficient to cover the costs incurred by Accuray to provide the  applicable Products to Distributor and the applicable Services to Customer (\"Accuray Cost\"). Distributor acknowledges and agrees  that it shall not be entitled to receive payment of any margin or commission until Accuray has received payment of the Accuray  Cost amount in relation to the applicable Products and Services.     6.

Third Party Claims. If Distributor promptly notifies Accuray of a claim it has received or of which it becomes aware that the Products or  any part thereof purchased by Distributor hereunder infringes a third party's proprietary rights, then Accuray agrees, at its  discretion, either to (i) defend the claim at its expense, with the cooperation of Distributor, provided, that Accuray shall reimburse  Distributor for any reasonable costs or expenses actually incurred by Distributor in connection with providing such cooperation, or  (ii) make changes in the Product or part thereof so that they are at least functionally equivalent and non-infringing or replace the  Products with alternatives that are at least functionally equivalent to avoid the claim, or (iii) purchase the right to use such  proprietary right or (iv) refund to the purchaser the net book value of the Product less a reasonable deduction for use, wear and tear,  and depreciation upon Accuray taking possession of such Product. Notwithstanding Section 10.1, the foregoing states the entire  liability of Accuray with respect to infringement of patents or other proprietary rights by the Products or part thereof, or by their  operation.

Distributor undertakes to  display Accuray's trademarks solely in connection with identifying Accuray in the sale and marketing of Products hereunder.  Distributor shall not remove copyright notices or any trademarks from the Products. Distributor shall not be entitled to use said  trademarks in conjunction with Distributor's own trademarks or for any other purpose, except in the manner authorized by Accuray,  which authorization will not be unreasonably withheld and in compliance with distribution standards and specifications established  by Accuray. If Accuray determines in its sole discretion that Distributor is not meeting such standards and specifications,  Distributor shall immediately, at Accuray's instructions, take all steps necessary to ensure that such standards and specifications  are met or cease all further use and display of the trademarks. In the event of expiration or termination of this Agreement, Distributor  shall immediately discontinue all use of Accuray's trademarks except for the sale of Distributor's inventory of Products.     10. INDEMNITIES.     10.1. Accuray Indemnity. Accuray will defend or settle any action brought against Distributor and shall indemnify and hold Distributor  harmless from any liability, damages and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) to the extent that it is  based upon a third-party claim that a Product, as provided by Accuray to Distributor under this Agreement, infringes any patent  issued in the United States, Germany, or in the country in which the Customer requested delivery of the Product or any copyright or  misappropriates any trade secret, and will pay any costs and damages made in settlement or awarded against Distributor in final  decision resulting from any such claim, provided that Distributor: (i) gives Accuray prompt notice of any such claim; (ii) gives  Accuray sole control of the defense and any related settlement of any such claim; and (iii) gives Accuray, at Accuray's expense, all  reasonable information, assistance and authority in connection with the foregoing.

This document  lists the minimum requirements for suppliers of Siemens Medical Solutions describing  \u00b7 how parts, components and systems are identified with their attributes and  \u00b7 how attributes are labeled both as plain text as well as barcode on products and its packaging. Detailed specifications with regards to the labeling  of products are defined for the individual product concerned.     2 Definitions and abbreviations      2.1 Material No.     The Siemens Medical Solutions Material No. is used to uniquely identify products (parts, components and systems). It consists of an 8-digit  identification no. assigned by Siemens Medical Solutions.     Previously, the term \"Part no.\" was also used; it is replaced by the term \"Material No.\".      2.2 Revision     The Revision (abbreviated \"Rev.\") serves to distinguish between different update statuses of hardware. It is assigned by Siemens Medical  Solutions.     The English term \"Revision\" replaces the German term \"Erzeugnisstand\" (abbreviated \"ES\") and \"Ausf\u00fchrungsstand\" (abbreviated \"AS\").     2.3 Serial No.     The Serial No. is an identifying attribute used to uniquely identify hardware or software with the same Material No. .     For suppliers the Serial No. can consist of up to 15 alphanumeric digits; it is however recommended to use only a 6 digit numerical Serial No. where  possible.     The Serial No. may contain a dash (-) or a slash (/), but no other special characters (e.g. # + * ?). Spaces, lower-case letters or language-specific  characters (e.g. \u00c4, \u00d6, \u00dc) are not allowed within the Serial No. .     The characters \"L\", \"SxxL\" or \"Sxx\" at the end or the beginning of the Serial No. should be avoided (xx = any alphanumerical character).     For any Serial No. that is numeric only (i.e. has no letters) it is allowed to omit printing of leading zeros (\u201e0\").     It is recommended to use the Serial No. of the supplier if it complies with the principles described above.     2.4 Data Identifier     Data Identifiers are used in the barcode to indicate that the information following the Data Identifier is data of a certain attribute. The Data  Identifier enables the barcode reading program to recognize that the following information represents a certain type of attribute.     Data Identifiers to be used:\n\n   3\n\n1P    Material No.   2P   Revision (for packaging only)  S    Serial No.   Q   Quantity (for packaging only)  14D    Expiration date (for packaging only)   T   Batch (for packaging only)\n\n\n\n\n\n     2.5 Expiration date     The format of the expiration date shall be definite and specified as follows: YYYYMMDD     2.6 Batch     The batch is an alphanumeric ident number with 10 digits, used to identify parts manufactured or shipped together. Is no batch provided on the  packing but required, a batch is initiated in the stock.     2.7 Shelf life     If a shelf life is defined for parts the shelf life has to be filed in calendar days. (365 days per year)     3 Reference documents     n.a.     4 Requirements     4.1 Identification of parts, components and systems     Non-serialized parts (including spare parts) and components are identified using a Material No. . If necessary, different statuses of a part,  component or system can be distinguished via the Revision.     Serialized parts, components and systems are identified using the combination of Material No. and Serial No. . In addition, the Revision may be  used to distinguish between different statuses of hardware.     4.2 Labeling of parts, components, systems and its packaging     In general, requirements with respect to labeling have to be defined for the product concerned. However, minimum requirements are specified in  order to allow proper identification throughout all processes involved. This chapter lists those minimum requirements.     For all material numbers specified by Siemens the parts and its packaging have to be labeled according to the requirements listed below. The label  depends on whether a part/component/system     \u00b7 is serialized  \u00b7 contains a revision level  \u00b7 is classified as an IVK (\"Installed Volume Component\")  \u00b7 shall be handled by expiration date or batch     Siemens defines those requirements per individual Material No. .     4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   5\n\nColor     Usually white label with black printing other colors are allowed as long as barcode/plain text  can be read         Barcode content    1P <Material No. >       S <Serial No.>         Additionally for packaging only    2P <product Revision>       Q <quantity of products in this packaging (numeric only), usually 1>              It is not allowed to label Revision and Quantity on product identification labels!              e.g.: 1P01234567 as barcode *) (1P) Model No. 01234567           S1001 as barcode *) (S) Serial No. 1001\n\n   Each symbol structure with start and stop character including Data Identifier (e.g. \"1P\" or  \"S\"), but without symbol check character.              No space allowed between Data Identifier and attribute.              It is not allowed to print any other information in the barcode fields described above.         Barcode type    Code 39 according to ISO/IEC 16388         Narrow element (bar or space)    Min. 0,17 mm         Ratio of wide element to narrow element    Min. 2,25 : 1         Barcode height    Min. 2 mm, typical 4mm         Plain text (below barcode)    (1P) Model No.: <Material No.>       (S) Serial No.: <Serial No.>         Additionally for packaging only    (2P) Revision: <product Revision>       (Q) Quantity: <quantity of products in this packaging (numeric only), usually 1>              It is not allowed to label Revision and Quantity on product identification labels!\n\n   Data Identifier (e.g. \"1P\" or \"S\") in brackets in front of data element title (e.g. ''Model No.\"  or \"Serial No.\") in plain text!              e.g.: (1P) Model No.: 01234567 *) (1p) Model No. 01234567       (S) Serial No.: 1001 *) (S) Serial No. 1001\n\n   Note: Due to 21CFR1020.30 section e) the term \"Model No.\" shall be used instead of the  term \"Material No.\" in plain text on all labels.\n\n\n\nIt is not allowed to print any other information near the data fields described above. If any  other information is printed, it must be printed in a manner so that it can't be misinterpreted  as being part of the fields described above; this can be done by printing other information at  the very right side of the label.

The provision of any items shall be subject to MBRK's  legal, medical and regulatory review and approval process. In the event that MBRK authorizes the provision of items of  nominal value to a DD Target Segment Prescriber, DD shall track and record the item provided, the associated value,  the date of the transaction, and the recipient DD Target Segment Prescriber, including his or her credentials and the  state in which he or she is licensed, where possible.\n\n3.5 DD shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promote MOXATAG to DD Target Segment Prescribers and agrees  to efficiently perform the services as described in EXHIBIT 4 in compliance with MBRK's policies and procedures, and  all applicable federal and state laws and regulations, including, without limitation, federal and state anti-kickback  statutes, regulations contained in 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) as they pertain to promotional activity of an  FDA-approved pharmaceutical product and the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General's (\"OIG\") Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (2003).

Both Parties agree to assign sufficient resources and personnel to discharge their respective responsibilities under  this Agreement in a timely manner and at all times operating using a professional standard of work as consistent with  industry standards.\n\n3.7. DD shall select and shall have full and complete control of and responsibility for all actions of its agents, affiliates,  officers, directors, employees or subcontractors (hereinafter \"Representatives\") and none of DD's Representatives are, or  shall be deemed to be, the Representatives of MBRK for any purpose whatsoever by virtue of this Agreement. MBRK  has no duty, liability or responsibility of any kind, to or for the acts or omissions of DD or any of DD's Representatives.  DD hereby acknowledges and agrees that DD shall cause each of DD's Representatives who participate in rendering the  services to comply with the terms of this Agreement. DD hereby acknowledges and agrees that DD is responsible for  the failure of any of DD's Representatives to comply with the terms of this Agreement.\n\n3.8. DD shall be responsible for obtaining the necessary contracts and releases with or from all parties whose names,  likenesses, testimonials, scripts, musical compositions or similar materials, assets or rights are used in MBRK's  advertising, promotional, publicity or other materials prepared and produced by DD under this Agreement, except where  MBRK undertakes to be responsible for obtaining the same.

Upon  termination or expiration of this Agreement, if specifically requested by MBRK, DD shall provide originals or copies of  such records to MBRK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 4 \u2014 Costs to Deliver DD Promotion\n\nAll costs incurred by DD to deploy its services to promote MOXATAG to DD Target Segment Prescribers will be the  responsibility of DD, except as provided in Section 6.\n\nSection 5 \u2014 Up-Front Payment, Deposit and Promotion Fees\n\n5.1. MBRK will pay DD an Up-Front Payment of $50,000 upon execution of this Agreement.\n\n5.2. Additionally, MBRK shall pay a Deposit to DD equal to $100,000 upon the Promotion Commencement Date. Each  month the Parties will review the amount of the Deposit and where necessary MBRK will make an additional deposit  payment to DD in order to maintain a total Deposit with DD of at least two (2) times the current month's Promotion  Fees. For example, if in a month Promotion Fees are $105,000, then MBRK will increase the Deposit to two (2) times  $105,000, equal to $210,000. The Parties agree to meet via conference call within five (5) business days of the end of  each month to determine the necessary adjustment, if any, to the Deposit. If it is determined that the Deposit must be  increased, within ten (10) business days of the date upon which the new Deposit is determined, MBRK shall send to  DD the funds necessary to increase the Deposit. Notwithstanding the above, if during years 2 and 3 of this Agreement,  in the event MBRK's then current annual form 10-K filed with the SEC does not contain an audit opinion that expresses  doubt about MBRK's ability to continue as a going concern, then MBRK's requirement to maintain a Deposit is waived.  In all cases the Deposit amount will be used to settle any outstanding amounts due to DD by MBRK at the end of the  Agreement or at the time the Deposit requirement is waived.\n\n5.3. Additionally, on or before the last day of each month, DD will invoice MBRK for the Promotion Fees due for the prior  month. Such Promotion Fees shall be calculated by:\n\n(a) the following formula for the period from the Effective Date through September 30, 2010:\n\nFor example: if during the month of March 2010 (a) (A) above was 2,000 TRx and (B) above was $36.50 then MBRK  would be remit $36,500.00 to DD.\n\nOR\n\n(b) the following formula for the period from October 1, 2010 through termination of this Agreement:\n\n  (A)   the Actual DD Target Segment MOXATAG TRx for the Promotional Measurement Period multiplied by:      (B)   the applicable Gross Margin Per TRx multiplied by:      (C)   50%.\n\n  (A)   the Actual DD Target Segment MOXATAG TRx Tablets for the Promotional Measurement Period multiplied by:      (B)   the applicable Gross Margin Per Tablet multiplied by:      (C)   50%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example: if during the month of November 2010:\n\nMBRK would remit $89,425.00 to DD:\n\nThese Promotion Fees represent fair market value payment for such services rendered.\n\nThe Parties recognize that Promotion Fees are to be settled on a monthly basis which requires the use of an estimated  Gross Margin Per Tablet amount until the actual Gross Margin Per Tablet for an applicable quarter can be determined.  Accordingly, to facilitate the calculation and settlement of monthly Promotion Fees for periods after September 2010,  the Parties agree that the Gross Margin Per Tablet used to settle the monthly Promotion Fees will be that as calculated  using the previous calendar quarter's Gross Margin Per Tablet data and current period's Actual DD Target Segment MOXATAG TRx. Such Promotion Fees for the three months in any calendar quarter will be subject to a true-up process  which will occur by the 15th of the second month of the following quarter. By way of example, Promotion Fees for each  of the months of April, May and June will be settled using the Gross Margin Per Tablet amount that has been calculated  for the quarter ended March 31 and will be subject to a true-up process to occur by August 15 with any adjustment to  such Promotion Fees being settled between the parties within 15 days thereafter.\n\n5.4 In the event MBRK shall discontinue detailing prescribers in a territory that is not included in the then current DD  Target Segment Prescribers set forth in EXHIBIT 1 to this Agreement or any amendments thereto (\"New DD Target  Segment Prescribers\"), the Parties shall negotiate in good faith the Promotion Fee payable to DD should MBRK desire  that DD add those New DD Target Segment Prescribers to the DD Target Segment Prescribers.\n\n5.5. The Promotion Fees shall be paid to DD by MBRK fifteen (15) days after the receipt of an invoice from DD by  MBRK.\n\n5. 6. The basis for determining the Promotion Fees will be the Prescriber Data provided by MBRK to DD.\n\n5.7. DD agrees to submit invoices to MBRK at the following address:\n\nAttn: Accounts Payable  MiddleBrook Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  7 Village Circle, Suite 100  Westlake, TX 76262\n\n  (A)=  Actual DD Target Segment MOXATAG TRx (5,000) x an average tablet amount for the month of (9.8 tablets)=  49,000      (B)=  3.65      (C)=  50%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 6 \u2014 Obligations of MBRK\n\n6.1. Subject to the terms of confidentiality set forth in Section 10, MBRK agrees to make available to DD to the best of  its ability the items as stipulated in EXHIBIT 2.

Additionally, MBRK or its authorized designee shall be responsible for the provision of MOXATAG samples in response to a prescriber's request as documented on a Sample Request Form and  MBRK or its authorized vendor shall be solely responsible for sample fulfillment in quantities agreed to by MBRK. At no  time shall DD take physical possession of or title to MOXATAG samples.\n\n6.2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, MBRK shall have the sole right and authority and in its sole  discretion shall take any actions that it deems appropriate with respect to MOXATAG as would normally be done in  accordance with accepted business practices and federal and state legal requirements to maintain the authorization  and/or ability to market MOXATAG in the US, including, without limitation, the following:\n\n(a)  manufacturing, storage, and distribution of MOXATAG trade and sample product;    (b)  the scope and strategies with respect to the marketing and promotion of MOXATAG, including, without limitation,  any labeling or claims in connection therewith;    (c)  booking sales and distribution of MOXATAG hereunder and performance of related services;    (d)  handling all aspects of order processing, invoicing and collection, inventory and receivables;    (e)  providing customer support, including handling medical queries, and performing other functions consistent with  consumer practice for prescription pharmaceuticals;    (f)   responding to product and medical complaints relating to MOXATAG;    (g)  handling all returns of MOXATAG trade and sample product;    (h)  handling all voluntary recalls and market withdrawals of MOXATAG. In such a situation, DD will make available to  MBRK, upon request, all of DD's pertinent records on MOXATAG. Any and all reasonable and documented costs  and expenses incurred by DD in the conduct of any such recall or market withdrawal of MOXATAG shall be  reimbursed by MBRK, except to the extent such recall or market withdrawal was the direct result of the negligence  or failure of DD to comply with its obligations under this Agreement;    (i)   communicating with any governmental agencies and satisfying their requirements regarding all regulatory approvals  of MOXATAG; including the filing of marketing and promotion materials approved by MBRK under this Agreement  with the FDA in compliance with all FDA pharmaceutical marketing regulations;    (j)   reporting adverse reaction reports to US regulatory authorities as required by applicable US law or regulation;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3 Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, MBRK shall have the sole right and responsibility for  establishing and modifying the terms and conditions with respect to the sale of MOXATAG, including, without limitation,  the price at which MOXATAG will be sold, any discounts attributable to payments on receivables and distribution of  MOXATAG.\n\n6.4. MBRK shall be responsible for the costs of obtaining, tracking, processing, formatting and reporting Prescriber  Data.\n\n6.5. The Cost of Samples Amount and the Cost of Coupon Redemption Amount shall be paid by MBRK.\n\nSection 7 \u2014 Independent Contractor\n\nIn the performance of DD's obligations under this Agreement, DD shall at all times act as and be deemed an  independent contractor. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to render DD or any of its employees, agents, or  officers, an employee, joint venturer, agent, or partner of MBRK. As an independent contractor, DD fees and expenses  are limited to those expressly stated in this Agreement. DD is not authorized to assume or create any obligations or  responsibilities, express or implied, on behalf of or in the name of MBRK, except as specifically defined herein. It is understood that the employees, methods, facilities, and equipment of DD shall at all times be under DD's exclusive  direction and control.

Only those prescribers who possess a valid state license to prescribe MOXATAG and practice in a clinical  area consistent with MOXATAG's approved labeling will be eligible to receive MOXATAG samples.

New educational messages may be created and added as a result of ongoing  understanding of prescribers' attitudes and perceptions. All content shall be approved by MBRK.\n\nDirect-to-Physician Bulletin Services \u2014 Promotional emails may be used to communicate the primary, secondary  and tertiary messages to the appropriate DD Target Segment Prescribers.

In addition to the Directory's landing page, banners can be  also served within the appropriate prescriber search and return pages. Such banner ads will be linked only to those prescribers whose practice area is consistent with MOXATAG's approved labeling. All banner ads and their respective  placement shall be approved by MBRK.\n\nDirect Mail Advertising \u2014 DD may use print mail to reach selected DD Target Segment Prescribers. Existing mail  creative concepts may be used or if needed, DD may create new mail concepts in concert with and as approved by  MBRK. At MiddleBrook's request, all direct mail advertising will include an opt-out option for recipient prescribers.\n\nCoupon Promotions \u2014 DD may deploy a program to promote and distribute Coupons to appropriate targets as  determined by both DD and the MBRK.

Search terms shall be consistent with MOXATAG's approved  labeling. All search terms and \"sponsored link\" content will be as approved by MBRK.\n\nWeb Mini Site Promotion \u2014 DD may develop and deploy content rich \"mini sites\" that consist of static content but  offer additional web properties in which to promote MOXATAG. Such mini sites may also be deployed as part of a  search engine strategy as small content rich sites generally score well within search engine algorithms and place  high within the natural return list. All content will be as approved by MBRK.\n\nDD will not deploy any promotional service relating to MOXATAG without prior written approval from MBRK.

APPOINTMENT.      -----------\n\n1.1  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Airspan hereby appoints Distributor as an independent, exclusive distributor to assist Airspan in marketing the Airspan Products to customers in the Territory, and Distributor hereby accepts such appointment as of the Effective Date of this Agreement. Distributor's appointment as a distributor of the Airspan Products grants to Distributor only a license to resell the\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 1\n\nAirspan Products to Distributor's customers in the Territory, and does not transfer any right, title, or interest in any of the Airspan Software to Distributor.\n\n1.2  Distributor's relationship to Airspan is that of an independent contractor, and nothing in this Agreement shall constitute Distributor as the agent or employee of Airspan.  Distributor shall have no authority to accept any order or make any offer (except as herein stated), or execute any instrument or make any commitment on behalf of Airspan.  Specifically, without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing, Distributor agrees not to make any representation, guarantee, or warranty on Airspan's behalf concerning the Airspan Products, but will refer customers to Airspan's printed literature. Nothing contained in this Agreement is to be construed as a limitation or restriction upon Airspan in the sale or other disposition of any of its products to any person, firm, or corporation inside or outside of the Territory. Airspan will pay no commissions under this Agreement.  Distributor's compensation is to be obtained solely by the difference between the price Distributor pays to Airspan and the price Distributor charges its customers. The parties also acknowledge that this Agreement is not intended to create a joint venture or partnership between Airspan and Distributor.\n\n1.3  Distributor will use its best efforts to maintain and support the Airspan Products within the Territory by devoting such attention, time, and effort as may be reasonably necessary to fully develop the available market potential.  During the term of this Agreement, and for a period of three (3) months following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, Distributor agrees that neither it nor any organization or entity controlled or directed by it will, without Airspan's prior, written consent, represent a manufacturer or supplier of products similar in design or performance to or which are of such a nature as to be competitive with any products contained in the Airspan Products, nor will Distributor market or otherwise promote the sale of such products. Distributor will give Airspan thirty (30) days' prior, written notice of each new potential representation role being considered by Distributor, and Distributor will not undertake such representation without Airspan's prior, written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Except as\n\n\n\n\n\nprovided above, in no event will Airspan consent to Distributor's consultation for or representation of a manufacturer or supplier, which is directly or indirectly, a competitor of Airspan.\n\n1.4  Distributor shall maintain a place of business at the location specified in Section 21.10 where Distributor can be contacted by Airspan, customers, and prospective customers during regular business hours with a permanent mailing address and an accessible cellular telephone, and will provide Airspan with written notice promptly upon any change in address.  Distributor agrees to assume all of the expenses of this place of business, including rent, stenographic services, and all other expenses except as specifically assumed in writing by Airspan.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 2\n\n1.5  Airspan will provide Distributor with such commercial and technical assistance and training as may reasonably be necessary, in Airspan's sole judgment, to enable Distributor to effectively carry out its activities under this Agreement and, in connection therewith, to provide such sales promotional materials, as Airspan may deem appropriate.  Airspan will provide such technical support as is reasonable and necessary to maintain the product line as a viable competitor in the market.\n\n2.

Distributor will conduct or provide for      any training of its personnel which may be necessary to impart such      knowledge.\n\n3.5  Distributor and its staff will research the technical requirements and      specifications of the market for Airspan Products in the Territory and make      information known to Airspan such that Airspan may, at its discretion,      implement appropriate technical changes to the Products to enable them to      be sold in the Territory. Airspan acknowledges that, subject to a further      and separate Agreement, such changes may be implemented in the future by      Distributor, with the assistance of Airspan.\n\n- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 4\n\n3.6  Distributor agrees to purchase and stock a comprehensive inventory of      spare parts based upon the recommended list set forth in Schedule III to      this Agreement.\n\n3.7  Distributor agrees to provide to its customers' installation services      for all Airspan Products.

Products      shall only be deemed similar if they provide like functionality.

Unless the context      otherwise requires, any term or expression which is defined in or given a      particular meaning by the provisions of the Incoterms shall have the same      meaning in this\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 9\n\nAgreement, but if there is any conflict between the provisions of the      Incoterms and this Agreement, the latter shall prevail.\n\n8.2 All risk of loss or damage to the Equipment and Software will pass to      Distributor on collection by the freight forwarder from Airspan. However,      Airspan will insure the Equipment against loss or damage in transit to the      agreed to location as set forth in the Purchase Order within the city      limits of the arrival airport as set forth in Paragraph 8.1.\n\n8.3 Title to the Equipment shall pass to Distributor on collection by the      freight forwarder from Airspan.\n\n8.4  If Distributor has any Airspan owned Equipment in its possession:\n\na.   Distributor shall ensure that Equipment is clearly marked as the      property of Airspan, and if asked, shall inform any third parties that the      Equipment is the property of Airspan;\n\nb.   Distributor shall not purport to create any security, mortgage, lien      or pledge over the Equipment, or otherwise deal with the Equipment without      Airspan's written consent;\n\n\n\n\n\nc.   In the event of any threatened seizure of the Equipment by any third      parties, and on termination or expiration of this Agreement, or any      Contract made pursuant to it, Airspan shall have the right, without      prejudice to any other remedy, to enter without prior notice any premises      and to repossess and take away or otherwise deal with the Equipment.\n\n8.5  The Software shall at all times remain the exclusive property of      Airspan, subject to the uses provided herein.\n\n8.6  Unless Distributor clearly advises Airspan to the contrary in      writing, Airspan may make partial deliveries on account of Purchase Orders.      Delay in delivery of any installment shall not relieve Distributor of its      obligation to accept said installment, provided that said delay does not      exceed sixty (60) days from Airspan's scheduled ship date and unless      Distributor has clearly advised Airspan to cancel the delayed installment      in writing at least fifteen (15) days prior to its revised planned shipment      date or its actual shipment date by Airspan.\n\n8.7  Airspan will use reasonable efforts to meet Distributor's requested      delivery schedules for Equipment and Software, but Airspan reserves the      right to refuse, or delay delivery to Distributor when Distributor's credit      is impaired,\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 10\n\nwhen Distributor is delinquent in payments or fails to meet other credit or      financial requirements reasonably established by Airspan, or when      Distributor has failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n8.8  Should orders for Equipment and Software exceed Airspan's available      inventory, Airspan will allocate its available inventory and make      deliveries on a basis that Airspan deems equitable, in its sole discretion,      and without liability to Distributor on account of the method of allocation      chosen or its implementation.  In any event, Airspan shall not be liable      for any direct, indirect, consequential, or special losses or damages      (including, but not limited to, loss of income or profit and loss of data)      that may be suffered by the Distributor or by any other person for failure      to deliver or for any delay or error in delivery of Equipment or Software      for any reason whatsoever.\n\n9.   TRADEMARKS AND COPYRIGHTS.\n\n9.1  Distributor acknowledges Airspan's exclusive right, title, and interest in and to any trademarks, trade names, logos and designations which Airspan may at any time have adopted, used, or registered in the United States of America and in the Territory (the \"Trademarks\"), and will not at any time do or cause to be done any act or thing contesting or in any way impairing or tending to impair any part of said right, title, and interest.  In connection with any reference to the Trademarks, Distributor shall not in any manner represent that it has an ownership interest in the Trademarks or registration(s) thereof, and Distributor acknowledges that no action by it or on its behalf shall create in Distributor's favor any right, title, or interest in or to the Trademarks.\n\n9.2  Distributor recognizes the validity of Airspan's copyright in any written material to which Airspan shall have made a claim to copyright protection, and Distributor specifically recognizes Airspan's exclusive right to copyright protection and/or registration of any translation of any advertising, promotional, or descriptive material furnished to Distributor by Airspan.\n\n9.3  Whenever Distributor refers to the Trademarks in advertising or in any other manner to identify the products, Distributor shall clearly indicate Airspan's ownership of the Trademarks and before distributing or publishing any advertising, descriptive, or promotional materials, Distributor shall affirmatively provide Airspan with an opportunity to inspect and approve such materials.\n\n9.4  Distributor agrees that when referring to the Trademarks, it shall diligently comply with all laws pertaining to the Trademarks at any time in force in the Territory.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 11\n\n9.5  Distributor shall promptly notify Airspan of any and all infringements, imitations, illegal uses, or misuses of the Trademarks which come to Distributor's attention.  Distributor also agrees that it shall not at any time take any action in the courts or before the administrative agencies of the Territory or otherwise to prevent the infringement, imitation, illegal use, or misuse of the Trademarks, it being clearly understood by Distributor that such action falls wholly within the authority of Airspan as sole owner of the Trademarks.\n\n9.6  Distributor agrees to render to Airspan all assistance in connection with any matter pertaining to the protection of the Trademarks, whether in the courts or before the administrative agencies of the Territory or otherwise, and to make promptly available to Airspan, its Distributors, and attorneys all of Distributor's files, records, and other information pertaining to the\n\n\n\n\n\nadvertising, promotion, and sale of the Airspan Products.  All assistance requested by Distributor in this paragraph shall be at AIRSPAN's expense.  This Expense includes costs, attorneys' and consultants' fees, and reimbursement of time spent by officers, agents and employees of Distributor.\n\n9.7  Distributor agrees and undertakes that it will not at any time, whether during the term of this Agreement or after its expiration or termination, adopt, use, or register without Airspan's prior, written consent any work or symbol or combination thereof which is similar to any of the Trademarks.\n\n9.8 In the advertising and sale of Airspan Products, Distributor may use the Trademarks in relation to those Airspan Products.  Distributor will not make or permit the alteration or removal of any tags, labels, or other identifying marks placed by Airspan on Airspan Products.  Distributor will not use or give any third party permission to use the Trademarks. Distributor will not use, or give any third party permission to use, the names \"Airspan Communications Ltd.\", \"Airspan Networks Incorporated\", \"ACL\", \"ANI\" or abbreviations or derivations thereof in Distributor's corporate titles, or in any way which might result in confusion as to Airspan and Distributor being separate and distinct entities. Distributor admits Airspan's exclusive ownership of the name \"Airspan Networks Incorporated\", \"Airspan Communications Ltd.\", \"ANI\", \"ACL\", and any abbreviations or derivations thereof and all of Airspan's Trademarks (whether registered or not).  Distributor shall not take any action inconsistent with Airspan's ownership of such Trademarks; therefore, Distributor shall treat all of Airspan's items distinctively (as to typography) and shall only use exact reproductions of all Airspan's symbols (including Airspan's logo).   Distributor shall not adopt or use any Trademark or product name which may be confusingly similar to any Airspan Trademark.  Distributor may use the Airspan logo as it appears on Airspan's letterhead.\n\n10.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND TRADE SECRETS.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 12\n\n10.1  In this Agreement, the term \"Confidential Information\" shall mean the information of Airspan disclosed to Distributor in connection with its performance under this Agreement, which is in written, recorded, photographic, machine-readable, or other physical form or oral information reduced to writing as soon as practicable after disclosure to Distributor, and which is conspicuously marked \"Confidential\", \"Proprietary\", \"Private\", or in any other manner indicating its confidential and/or proprietary nature.  Without limitation, Confidential Information includes:  (1) Airspan's software products, materials, data reports, programs, documentation, diagrams, and all related technical information; (2) all information relating to Airspan's business and products which is critical to Airspan's position in the marketplace, including future plans of Airspan relating to the fields of endeavor in which Distributor performs services for Airspan, the nature of certain work projects to which Distributor is exposed, and the identity of persons working on those projects; and (3) any improvements, enhancements, or modifications to the above made by or on behalf of Airspan during the performance under this Agreement which are provided, made available, or disclosed by or on behalf of Airspan to Distributor, or used by Airspan or any of Airspan's other Distributors in connection with their own sales activities.\n\n10.2  Trade secrets are confidential information that includes ideas, concepts, techniques, processes, inventions, knowledge, and know-how developed by Airspan which:  (1) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (2) is subject to the efforts of Airspan that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.  (This \"trade secret\" language comes from the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.)\n\n10.3  Distributor covenants and agrees that it will use the Confidential Information solely for the performance of services under this Agreement, and shall not disclose such Confidential Information to any other person (including Airspan employees in any other division, group, or entity), firm, or corporation.\n\n10.4  Distributor shall use the same degree of care in safeguarding the Confidential Information as it uses for its own confidential information of like importance, but no less than reasonable care.  Upon discovery of any disclosure or misuse of Confidential Information, Distributor shall endeavor to prevent any further disclosure or misuse.\n\n10.5  All Confidential Information shall remain the property of Airspan, and such Confidential Information and all copies thereof shall promptly be returned to Airspan upon request or, at Airspan 's option, destroyed, in which case Airspan shall be notified in writing when it has been destroyed.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 13\n\n10.6  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting to or conferring upon Distributor any rights, by license or otherwise, express or implied, in Airspan's Confidential Information, other than the right to use the Confidential Information for the purpose of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.7  Any copies of the Confidential Information made by Distributor shall reproduce proprietary marking and legends included therein, but the provisions of this Agreement supersede any provisions of such legends inconsistent herewith.\n\n10.8  The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be disclosed by Distributor to others, except with the prior, written consent of Airspan, or as may be required by law or as necessary to establish its rights hereunder.\n\n10.9  If, in connection with its performance, Distributor discloses to Airspan any ideas, developments, or inventions conceived or actually reduced to practice by Distributor prior to its performance hereunder, no relationship, confidential or otherwise, express or implied, is established with Airspan by the disclosure thereof.  With respect to any such disclosure, no obligation of any kind is assumed by nor may be implied against Airspan, its subsidiary, or associated companies unless a formal, separate, written contract regarding the subject of disclosure is consummated by the parties, and then the obligation shall be only as expressed in the separate contract.\n\n10.10  Distributor agrees that any breach of the provisions of this Section by Distributor or Distributor's personnel, agents, or subcontractors, or any third party providing products or services to Distributor will cause immediate and irreparable injury to Airspan and that, in the event of such breach, Airspan shall be entitled to injunctive relief and any and all other remedies available at law or in equity.\n\n10.11  After Distributor has received Airspan's Confidential Information and know-how, it will be impossible to segregate Airspan's knowledge and know- how from other knowledge acquired independently by Distributor.  Accordingly, during the performance of this Agreement and for three (3) months after termination of services under this Agreement, Distributor will not offer services to third parties which compete with the services provided by Airspan under this Agreement, or otherwise use the knowledge acquired from Airspan in order to compete with Airspan or its customers.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, Distributor is not precluded from any activities which concern product sectors or industries other than those that concern products or services similar to those offered by Airspan in connection with this Agreement.  Nothing in this paragraph will be construed to prevent Distributor from providing service to existing customers of Distributor which would result in their interruption of service to the public.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 14\n\n10.12 During the performance of this Agreement and for three (3) months after termination of services under this Agreement, Airspan will not offer products or services to third parties which compete with the products or services provided by Distributor under this Agreement, or otherwise use the knowledge acquired from Distributor in order to compete with Distributor its customers\n\n10.13 The obligations of this Section 10 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n11.  SOFTWARE LICENSE.\n\n11.1 Airspan grants Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts, a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use, and to sublicense as set forth below, Software provided by Airspan hereunder only on a single System or unit of Equipment, as may be applicable.  No license is granted to use the Software on multiple Systems or in conjunction with Equipment furnished by a party other than Airspan, unless specifically agreed to in writing by Airspan.  Software licensed under this Agreement is defined as: (a) any digital instruction sequence or control data contained on any media, including but not limited to, any magnetic-, electronic-, optical-, or organic device, and the term Software shall include any enhancement, modification, extension, part, portion or expansion thereof or implementation or downloading from network of any of the foregoing, for use exclusively on a System or a unit of Equipment; and (b) all associated documentation used to describe, maintain and use the Software.\n\n11.2 Any Software provided to Distributor by Airspan will be treated as the exclusive property of Airspan, and Distributor will:  (a) treat such Software as Confidential Information under Section 10 of this Agreement; (b) utilize such Software or any portions or aspects thereof (including any methods or concepts utilized therein) solely on Systems or Equipment provided by Airspan; (c) forthwith return to Airspan all memory media, documentation and/or other material that has been modified, updated or replaced; (d) except to the extent permitted by applicable law not modify, disassemble or decompile such Software, or reverse engineer any portion of the Software or functioning of Systems or Equipment, or permit others to do so, without Airspan's prior written consent; (e) except to the extent permitted by applicable law not reproduce or copy such Software in whole or in part except for backup and archival purposes or as otherwise permitted in writing by Airspan; (f) not perform or release benchmarks or other comparisons of the Software; and (g) not remove any trademark, tradename, copyright, notice or other proprietary notice from the Software and Distributor shall be responsible for the conservation of the same on any back-up copy of the Software.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 15\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3 In the event of a breach of this license by Distributor, then Airspan may, in its discretion, terminate the license with immediate effect, whereupon Distributor shall return to Airspan all Software and copies thereof within ten (10) days.\n\n12        EXCUSABLE DELAY.\n\nAirspan shall not suffer any liability for non-performance, defective performance, or late performance under this Agreement due to causes beyond its control and without its fault or negligence such as, but not limited to, acts of God, war (including civil war), civil unrest, acts of government, fire, floods, explosions, the elements, epidemics, quarantine, restrictions, strikes, lock- outs, plant shutdown, material shortages, or delays in transportation or delays of its suppliers or subcontractors for like cause.\n\nIn the event of excusable delay as defined in the preceding sentence, then Airspan, upon giving prompt written notice to Distributor, shall be excused from such performance on a day-to-day basis to the extent of such prevention, restriction, or interference (and Distributor shall likewise be excused from performance of its obligations on a day-to-day basis to the extent Distributor's obligations relate to the performance so prevented, restricted, or interfered with), provided that Airspan shall use its best endeavors to avoid or remove such causes of non-performance and both parties shall proceed to perform with dispatch whenever such causes are removed or cease to exist.\n\n13.  TERM AND TERMINATION.\n\n13.1  This Agreement shall remain in effect for sixty (60) months from the Effective Date (the \"Initial Term\"). After the Initial Term, the term of the Agreement may be extended by a further period of five (5) years by mutual written agreement by the parties in the form of an amendment to this Agreement. If Distributor wishes to extend the term of the Agreement beyond the Initial Term, it  must notify Airspan in writing at least six (6) months prior to then end of the Initial Term. However, nothing contained herein shall be interpreted as requiring either party to renew or extend this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or of any other provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated prior to the expiration of its stated term as set forth below.\n\n13.2  Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time during the term of this Agreement if  either party fails materially to comply with any covenant, term, or provision of this Agreement, by written notice given to the other party not less than thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such termination. Either party's right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 13.2 may not be exercised unless said\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 16\n\nparty shall have given the other party written notice of the failure, and the other party has not cured the failure within the thirty (30) day period following notice from said party.\n\n13.3  This Agreement terminates automatically for just cause, with no further act or action of either party if:  (a) a receiver is appointed for Distributor or its property; (b) Distributor&sbsp;makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (c) any proceedings are commenced by, for, or against Distributor under any bankruptcy, insolvency, or debtor's relief law; or (d) Distributor is liquidated, dissolved, or otherwise terminates its activities.\n\n13.4 In the event of termination by either party for any reason, Distributor shall provide Airspan with lists of existing customers as well as other information necessary for an orderly changeover of representation in the Territory.\n\n13.5  Upon termination, Distributor shall immediately return to Airspan all Confidential Information, and Distributor agrees that neither it nor any company or organization controlled or directed by it shall divulge the contents of such material to any person at any time, notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.\n\n13.6 Airspan shall not be liable to Distributor for damages of any kind, including incidental or consequential damages, on account of the termination of this agreement in accordance with this section 13.  Airspan shall not be liable to Distributor on account of termination or expiration of this Agreement for reimbursement or damages for loss of goodwill, prospective profits, or anticipated orders, or on account of any expenditures, investments, leases, or commitments made by either party, or for any other reason whatsoever based upon or growing out of such termination or expiration.  Airspan will recognize payments due to Distributor for orders received up to ninety (90) days after the termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n\n13.7  Distributor acknowledges and agrees that: (a) Distributor has no expectation and has received no assurances that its business relationship with Airspan will continue beyond the states term of this agreement or its earlier termination in accordance with this section, that any investment by Distributor in the promotion of Airspan's Products will be recovered or recouped, or that Distributor shall obtain any anticipated amount of profits by virtue of this Agreement; and (b) Distributor shall not have or acquire by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise any vested, proprietary, or other right in the promotion of Airspan's Products or in any goodwill created by its efforts hereunder.\n\n\n\n\n\n13.8  This Section 13.8, as well as the provisions of Sections 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 and 18, shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 17\n\n14.  WARRANTY.\n\n14.1 THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN SECTIONS 14 AND 15 OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE IN LIEU OF, AND Airspan HEREBY DISCLAIMS, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED TERMS AND WARRANTIES OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n14.2 Subject to Sections 14.3 and 14.4, Airspan warrants that the Equipment sold to Distributor under this Agreement shall, under normal use and service, be free from defects in materials and faulty workmanship, and that the Software licensed to Distributor under this Agreement shall conform in all material respects to Airspan's published specifications therefor. The warranty period for any item of Equipment and related Software shall be twelve (12) months from the date of delivery of such Equipment and related Software to Distributor as set forth in Paragraph 8.1 (hereinafter, this period of time shall be referred to as the \"Initial Warranty Period.\")\n\n14.3 Airspan's obligation and Distributor's sole remedy under this warranty are limited to the replacement or repair, at Airspan's option, of the defective Equipment or Software within the Initial Warranty Period. Airspan shall have no obligation to remedy any such defect if it can be shown that: (a) the Equipment or Software was altered, repaired, or reworked by any party other than Airspan without Airspan's prior written consent; (b) such defects were the result of Distributor's or a third party's improper storage, mishandling, abuse, or misuse of the Equipment or Software; (c) such defects were the result of Distributor's or a third party's use of the Equipment or Software in conjunction with equipment electronically or mechanically incompatible or of an inferior quality; or (d) the defect was the result of damage by fire, explosion, power failure, or any act of nature.\n\n14.4  In no event shall Airspan be obliged to provide on-site maintenance. Subject to the provisions of this warranty clause, defective parts or components must be returned by Distributor to Airspan's designated facility located within the contiguous 48 states in the United States, freight prepaid, within the Initial Warranty Period, and said defective parts will be repaired or replaced by Airspan at no charge to Distributor.  In connection with such return by Distributor, Distributor shall comply with Airspan's Return Material Authorization (RMA) procedures.  Risk of loss or damage to Equipment or Software returned to Airspan for repair or replacement shall be borne by Distributor until delivery to Airspan.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n16.1  WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO SECTION 16.4, NEITHER Airspan, NOR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, SHAREHOLDERS, OR AFFILIATES (Airspan AND SUCH OTHER PERSONS, THE \"Airspan PARTIES\"), SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO DISTRIBUTOR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, INCOME, REVENUE OR DATA, OR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PURCHASE ORDER PLACED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER COLLATERAL CONTRACT, OR FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE EQUIPMENT OR THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE THEREOF OR THE INABILITY TO USE THEM EITHER SEPARATELY OR IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER EQUIPMENT OR SOFTWARE, OR FROM ANY OTHER CAUSE, WHETHER CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY, ON GROUNDS OF FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OR OTHERWISE.\n\n16.2  Without prejudice to Sections 16.3 and 16.4, the liability of the Airspan Parties, taken as a whole, for each event or series of connected events\n\n\n\n\n\narising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any purchase order placed pursuant to this Agreement, or any other collateral contract, or from or in connection with the Equipment or Software or the use thereof, or the inability to use them either separately or in combination with other equipment or software, or from any other cause, whether caused by negligence, breach of contract, strict liability, breach of warranty, on grounds of failure of essential purpose, or otherwise, shall in no circumstance exceed the total amount payable by Distributor to Airspan under this Agreement for the provision of\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 19\n\nthe Equipment or Software which gave rise to the loss or damage or in connection with which the loss or damage was incurred.\n\n16.3  Airspan Parties, taken as a whole, shall be liable for physical damage to Distributor's property resulting from Airspan's negligence under or in connection with this Agreement up to a maximum aggregate amount of one million US Dollars (US$1,000,000).  And Distributor, taken as a whole, shall be liable for physical damage to Airspan's property resulting from Distributor's negligence under or in connection with this Agreement up to a maximum aggregate amount of one million US Dollars (US$1,000,000).\n\n16.4  Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or in any way limit Airspan liability for death or personal injury caused by its negligence.\n\n16.5  Save as provided for in Section 17 Distributor shall indemnify and hold harmless and defend the Airspan Parties from and against all claims, demands, actions, suits, proceedings, writs, judgments, orders and decrees brought, made or rendered against them or any of them and all damages, losses and expenses suffered or incurred by them or any of them howsoever arising out of or related to the breach by Distributor of any of the terms of this Agreement. Airspan shall notify Distributor forthwith of any claim, demand, action, suit, proceeding, writ, judgment, order or decree falling within the scope of this Section 16.5 and shall permit Distributor sole conduct of the same and shall provide reasonable assistance in relation thereto, subject to appropriate defense by Distributor and the payment by Distributor of Airspan's reasonable costs and expenses.\n\n16.6  Distributor shall include, in its agreements with its customers pursuant to which Distributor supplies Equipment or Software, provisions pursuant to which such customers agree that the Airspan Parties shall have no liability for any of the types of damages referred to at Section 16.1 in connection with or arising from the Equipment or Software or the use thereof, or the inability to use them either separately or in combination with other equipment or software, or from any other causes.\n\n17.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS INDEMNITY.\n\n17.1 Airspan agrees to indemnify and hold Distributor harmless with respect to any suit, claim, or proceeding brought against Distributor by a third party alleging that Distributor's use of the Equipment or the Software, separately or in combination, as a whole or in part, constitutes an infringement of any patent or copyright or misuse of proprietary or trade secret information.  Airspan agrees to defend Distributor against any such claims and to pay all litigation costs, reasonable attorney's fees, settlement payments, and any damages awarded or resulting from any such claim.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 20\n\n17.2 Distributor shall promptly advise Airspan of any such suit, claim, or proceeding and shall co-operate with Airspan in the defense or settlement thereof.  Airspan shall have sole control of the defense of any action involving such a claim and of all negotiations for its settlement or compromise.\n\n17.3 In the event that an injunction is obtained against Distributor's use of the Equipment and/or the Software, in whole or in part, as a result of any such claim, Airspan shall use its best efforts to either: (a) procure for Distributor the right to continue using the portions of the Equipment or the Software enjoined from use; or (b) replace or modify the same with functionally equivalent or better Equipment and/or Software so that Distributor's use is not subject to any such injunction.  In the event that Airspan cannot perform the remedies set forth in Sections 17.3(a) or 17.3(b), then Distributor shall have the right to return such Equipment and the Software to Airspan.  In the event of such return, Airspan shall refund the depreciated value of the Equipment and the license to use the Software within thirty (30) days of the receipt by Airspan of the Equipment and the Software.\n\n17.4 This indemnity shall not apply to claims arising in respect to the use of the Equipment or Software supplied by Airspan or manufactured by its suppliers in accordance with any design or any special instruction furnished by Distributor, or which is used by Distributor in a manner or for a purpose not contemplated by this Agreement.\n\n17.5 The provisions of this Section 17 set forth the entire obligation of Airspan with respect to any claim of patent infringement, copyright infringement, or misuse of proprietary or trade secret information.\n\n18.  EXPORT CONTROLS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE.\n\n\n\n\n\n18.1 If any approval with respect to this Agreement, or the registration thereof, shall be required at any time during the term of this Agreement, with respect to giving legal effect to this Agreement in the Territory, or with respect to compliance with exchange regulations or other requirements so as to assure the right of remittance abroad of United States dollars pursuant to Section 6 hereof, Distributor shall immediately take whatever steps may be necessary in this respect, and any charges incurred in connection therewith shall be for the account of Distributor.  Distributor shall keep Airspan currently informed of its efforts in this connection.  Airspan shall be under no obligation to ship Airspan Products to Distributor hereunder until Distributor has provided Airspan with satisfactory evidence that such approval or registration is not required or that it has been obtained.\n\n18.2 In the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, Distributor shall at all times strictly comply with all export laws, regulations, and orders of the\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 21\n\nUnited Kingdom and the United States of America.

If, following Location Acceptance of all Cell Sites, Vendor consummates any Change of Control of Vendor to any Restricted Entity without the prior written consent of AT&T, then AT&T shall have the right, in its sole\n\nProprietary and Confidential This Agreement and information contained therein is not for use or disclosure outside of AT&T, its Affiliates, and third party representatives, and Vendor except under written agreement by the contracting parties. 10\n\nSource: ATN INTERNATIONAL, INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2019\n\n\n\n\n\ndiscretion, to (x) immediately terminate the Maintenance Addendum without further liability or obligation (other than payment of Maintenance Fees for Maintenance Services performed prior to the date of such termination), but not this Agreement or the obligation to make the Structured Payments herein; and/or (y) prepay all of the remaining Structured Payments at any time in one lump sum payment without penalty, liability or obligations (including any \"make- whole\" obligation or Close-Out Costs (as such term is defined in the Build Addendum)).\n\n(d) Any assignment, delegation or transfer for which consent is required hereby and which is made without such consent given in writing will be void. No assignment by a Party will relieve such Party of its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n3.6 Compliance with Laws.

Vendor represents and warrants that, to its knowledge, no officer, director, employee or agent of AT&T has been or will be employed, retained or paid a fee, or otherwise has received or will receive, any personal compensation or consideration, by or from Vendor or any of Vendor's officers, directors, employees or agents in connection with the obtaining, arranging or negotiation of this Agreement or other documents entered into or executed in connection with this Agreement.\n\nVendor shall not offer or give gratuities in the form of gifts, entertainment, concessions, or otherwise to AT&T or its employees or representative(s), or any person related by blood or marriage to such individuals for the express or implied purpose of obtaining or securing favorable treatment with respect to this Agreement, or in the inspection or acceptance of the Services to be performed thereunder. Vendor shall not engage in any conduct which will constitute or appear to constitute a conflict of interest between Vendor's responsibility to AT&T under this contract and Vendor's responsibility to any person, business, or other entity with which Vendor may have had any dealings.\n\n3.8 Construction and Interpretation\n\n(a) This Agreement has been prepared jointly and has been the subject of arm's length and careful negotiation. Each Party has been given the opportunity to independently review this Agreement with legal counsel and other consultants, and each Party has the requisite experience and sophistication to understand, interpret and agree to the particular language of its provisions. Accordingly, the drafting of this Agreement is not to be attributed to either Party.\n\nProprietary and Confidential This Agreement and information contained therein is not for use or disclosure outside of AT&T, its Affiliates, and third party representatives, and Vendor except under written agreement by the contracting parties. 11\n\nSource: ATN INTERNATIONAL, INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Article, Section and paragraph headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and are not to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The word \"include\" in every form means to include without limitation by virtue of enumeration and a derivative of a defined term shall have the meaning appropriate to the context of its use. Whenever this Agreement refers to a consent or approval to be given by either Party, unless such consent is expressly required to be given in writing and signed by the Party giving approval or consent, then such consent or approval is effective if given in an email from the individuals identified in Section 3.26 or designated by Vendor as its Project Manager pursuant to Section 18 of the Build Addendum. The Parties agree that time is of the essence with respect to AT&T's approval rights pursuant to this Agreement and the Build Addendum and Maintenance Addendum and Vendor is relying on the timeliness of such approvals or consents as set forth herein in order to complete the Services. The use of singular words includes the plural and vice versa.\n\n3.9 Cumulative Remedies. The rights and remedies of the Parties set forth in this Agreement are not exclusive of, but are cumulative to, any rights or remedies now or subsequently existing at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise, except in those cases where this Agreement specifies that a particular remedy is sole or exclusive, but neither Party may retain the benefit of inconsistent remedies. No single or partial exercise of any right or remedy with respect to one breach of this Agreement precludes the simultaneous or subsequent exercise of any other right or remedy with respect to the same or a different breach.\n\n3.10 Delivery, Performance and Acceptance\n\n(a) Vendor acknowledges that AT&T is responsible for the deployment of the FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network (the \"NPSBN\") in accordance with the terms of AT&T's agreement with the FirstNet Authority and that AT&T has provided certain terms of such agreement to Vendor but has not provided Vendor with a copy of such agreement with the FirstNet Authority. Therefore, Vendor understands generally that AT&T's business requires prompt Delivery of Material and provision of Services by the specified Delivery Dates. Furthermore, the Parties agree that dates for Delivery of Material and Services are firm subject to any Excusable Delay, time is of the essence, and, subject to any Excusable Delay, Vendor will complete such Delivery in strict conformance with the Specifications.\n\n(b) Vendor shall perform or cause to be performed testing sufficient to ensure that all of the Material and Deliverables perform in accordance with the Specifications, including all of the Cell Site optimization and testing contemplated by the Build Addendum. If testing indicates that any of the Cell Sites (or any of the Material or Deliverables relating thereto) does not conform to the Specifications, then Vendor shall notify AT&T, in writing, of such non- conformance promptly following Vendor's knowledge of such non- conformance. AT&T will advise Vendor whether Vendor should Deliver the non-conforming Cell Site or any of the Deliverables or Material relating thereto.

If such non-conforming Cell Site has not been cured within such nine (9) month cure period (or 60-day cure period in the case of a Lien), AT&T shall have no further obligation to pay any Maintenance Fees to Vendor with respect to such non-conforming Cell Site until the non-conformance has been cured. Provisional Location Acceptance of any such non-conforming Cell Site or receipt of any of the Deliverables or Material relating thereto shall not constitute Location Acceptance and shall not constitute a waiver of any of AT&T's rights, warranties, or remedies under this Agreement or elsewhere, including Termination Remedies under the Build Addendum.

After Vendor provides written notice to AT&T of any Force Majeure Event in accordance with the preceding sentence, the Parties shall extend the applicable Delivery Date or Completion Date for the length of such Force Majeure Event and, subject to Subsection (b) below, such Force Majeure Event shall be an Excusable Delay.\n\n(b) If Vendor is the Party whose performance is prevented or delayed by a Force Majeure Event and AT&T determines that the Force Majeure Event is reasonably likely to cause a material delay of the ultimate Delivery Date or Completion Date for any Cell Site, then AT&T may elect to, after consultation with Vendor and good faith discussion to negotiate another resolution:\n\n(i) terminate its obligations with respect to each Cell Site affected by or related to such Force Majeure Event under this Agreement and exercise any of the Termination Remedies set forth in the Build Addendum, in each case without liability to Vendor; provided that AT&T shall pay to Vendor, an amount equal to demonstrated costs incurred by Vendor for any Work completed (in accordance with applicable Specifications and requirements) to the extent such Work is transferable to and usable by AT&T as of the effective time of termination of the applicable terminated Cell Site, which amount shall not exceed $[***]; or\n\n(ii) suspend this Agreement or any part hereof for the duration of such Force Majeure Event solely with respect to any Cell Site affected by or related to such Force Majeure Event, obtain Work elsewhere (including AT&T's performance of the Work itself), at AT&T's cost and expense (which shall reduce the Structured Payments applicable to such Cell Site by such amount, but in no event shall such reduction cause the Structured Payments to be less than an amount equal to the demonstrated costs incurred by Vendor up to the date of suspension), and provide notice to Vendor when AT&T desires for Vendor to resume its performance under this Agreement for the remaining Work at such Cell Site.\n\n3.13 Government Contract Provisions and Flow Downs\n\n(a) To the extent that Vendor's performance is required to comply with certain executive orders (including E.O. 11246 and E.O. 13201) and statutes (including Section 503 of the\n\nProprietary and Confidential This Agreement and information contained therein is not for use or disclosure outside of AT&T, its Affiliates, and third party representatives, and Vendor except under written agreement by the contracting parties. 14\n\nSource: ATN INTERNATIONAL, INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; the Vietnam Era Veteran's Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974; Section 8116 of the Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Pub.

Subject to AT&T's obligation to reimburse or indemnify Vendor as set forth in Subsection (c) or (d) below, respectively, Vendor's duty to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the AT&T Indemnified Parties against any Third Party Loss extends to any Third Party Loss that may be caused or alleged to be caused in part by the negligence of any of the AT&T Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent that such indemnification is permitted by applicable Law.\n\n(b) AT&T shall promptly notify Vendor in writing of any claim, demand, suit, cause of action or legal proceeding that may give rise to a claim against Vendor for defense and indemnification under this Section 3.15. If AT&T fails to give notice, Vendor is still obligated to indemnify, hold harmless and defend the AT&T Indemnified Parties, except that Vendor is not liable for any Litigation Expense that AT&T incurs before the time when notice is given or for any Loss or Liability to the extent that Vendor can show that such delay or failure to provide notice actually and materially prejudiced it in defending against such Loss or Liability.\n\n(c) Vendor shall conduct the defense (employing one or more competent attorneys from a nationally recognized law firm), at Vendor's expense, against any claim, demand, suit or cause of action within the scope of Subsection (a) above, whether or not litigation is actually commenced or the allegations are meritorious and, upon AT&T's request, keep AT&T informed as to the progress of such defense.

AT&T and Vendor shall cooperate in the defense of any such claim. Vendor may control the defense and settlement of such a claim, but if the settlement of a claim may have an adverse effect on any of the AT&T Indemnified Parties, then Vendor shall not settle such claim without the consent of AT&T, and AT&T shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay its consent. To the extent that Vendor pays any part of a judgment, award or settlement with respect to the Third Party Loss and any other expenses related to the resolution of the Third Party Loss, including costs, interest, and Attorneys' Fees, as a result of being self-insured (including any deductible) or as a result of insurance coverage being insufficient to cover the amount of the judgment, award or settlement, upon final resolution of the claim, demand, suit or cause of action, AT&T shall reimburse Vendor for the pro-rata portion of any such payment based on the AT&T Indemnified Parties' fault relative to Vendor's fault.\n\n(d) In addition to AT&T's obligation to reimburse Vendor as set forth in Subsection (c) above, AT&T shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Vendor Indemnified Parties against any Third Party Loss arising solely from or in connection with, resulting solely from, or relating solely to (i) the AT&T Provided Equipment furnished by AT&T or (ii) the negligent or intentionally wrongful acts or omissions of any of the AT&T Indemnified Parties under this Agreement; in each case in the same manner as set forth in Subsection (b) and in the first four sentences of Subsection (c), with the appropriate changes having been made.\n\n(e) Subject to AT&T's obligation to reimburse or indemnify Vendor as set forth in Subsection (c) and (d) above, respectively, Vendor shall bring no claim or action for indemnification, contribution, or subrogation against any of the AT&T Indemnified Parties nor shall Vendor implead any of them in any action brought by another, based on injury to the person or death arising out or relating to Vendor's performance under this Agreement. If, through any such action, Vendor ever acquires a Lien on a judgment against any of the AT&T Indemnified Parties, then Vendor shall assign such Lien to AT&T. Vendor waives any immunity from indemnification (only with respect to the AT&T Indemnified Parties) that Vendor may hold, by virtue of Vendor's compliance with its workers' compensation obligations in any jurisdiction, even if such immunity arises under the constitution or statutes of such jurisdiction.\n\n(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, the Parties intend that any amount for which any of the AT&T Indemnified Parties might otherwise have an obligation of reimbursement to Vendor for its pro-rata portion pursuant to this Section will be net of any insurance proceeds or other amounts paid by Vendor's insurance company (\"Insurance Proceeds\") that actually reduce the amount that Vendor is required to pay on account of a Third Party Loss. Accordingly, the amount with respect to which AT&T is required to reimburse Vendor its pro-rata portion will be reduced by any Insurance Proceeds theretofore actually paid on behalf of Vendor in respect of the related Third Party Loss.

An insurer that would otherwise be obligated to pay any amount as a result of a Third Party Loss shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto or, by virtue of the indemnification or reimbursement provisions hereof, have any subrogation rights with respect thereto, it being expressly understood and agreed that no insurer or any other third party shall be entitled to a \"wind-fall\" (i.e., a benefit they would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the indemnification provisions) by virtue of the indemnification or reimbursement provisions hereof.

For the purpose of this clause, AT&T's disclosure of Information to Vendor includes any Information that Vendor receives, observes, collects, stores, or accesses, in any way, in connection with this Agreement and all such Information disclosed by AT&T hereunder shall be and shall remain the sole and exclusive property of AT&T. Information of a disclosing Party shall be deemed to be confidential or proprietary only if it is clearly marked or otherwise identified by the disclosing Party as being confidential or proprietary, provided that if it is orally or visually disclosed (including Information conveyed to an answering machine, voice mail box or similar medium), the disclosing Party shall designate it as confidential or proprietary at the time of such disclosure, however, failure to do so shall not prevent such Information from receiving the protections afforded to it in this Section 3.16. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a disclosing Party shall not have any such obligation to so mark or identify, or to so designate, Information that the disclosing Party discloses to or is otherwise obtained by the other Party's employees, contractors, or representatives (i) who are located on the disclosing Party's premises; (ii) who access the disclosing Party's systems; or (iii) who otherwise obtain AT&T Information and/or AT&T Customer Information in connection with this Agreement; any such Information so disclosed shall automatically be deemed to be confidential and proprietary. Additionally, the failure to mark or designate information as being confidential or proprietary will not waive the confidentiality where it is reasonably obvious, under the circumstances surrounding disclosure, that the Information is confidential or proprietary; any such Information so disclosed or obtained shall automatically be deemed to be confidential and proprietary. For greater certainty, Information provided by either Party to the other Party prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement in connection with a separate\n\nProprietary and Confidential This Agreement and information contained therein is not for use or disclosure outside of AT&T, its Affiliates, and third party representatives, and Vendor except under written agreement by the contracting parties. 18\n\nSource: ATN INTERNATIONAL, INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nnon-disclosure agreement (howsoever denominated) is also subject to the terms of this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the expiration or termination of this Agreement or any return or destruction of Information, all Information, including without limitation that as may be retained in accordance with the above-referenced exceptions, will continue to be subject to the provisions of this Section 3.16 for so long as such Information remains in the custody or control of the receiving Party.\n\nProprietary and Confidential This Agreement and information contained therein is not for use or disclosure outside of AT&T, its Affiliates, and third party representatives, and Vendor except under written agreement by the contracting parties. 19\n\nSource: ATN INTERNATIONAL, INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Except for Customer Information, neither Party shall have any obligation to the other Party with respect to Information which:\n\n(i) at the time of disclosure was already known to the receiving Party free of any obligation to keep it confidential (as evidenced by the receiving Party's written records prepared prior to such disclosure);\n\n(ii) is or becomes publicly known through no wrongful act of the receiving Party (such obligations ceasing at the time such Information becomes publicly known);\n\n(iii) is lawfully received from a third party, free of any obligation to keep it confidential;\n\n(iv) is independently developed by the receiving Party or a third party, as evidenced by the receiving Party's written records, and where such development occurred without any direct or indirect use of or access to the Information received from the disclosing Party, or\n\n(v) the disclosing Party consents in writing to be free of restriction.\n\n(d) If a receiving Party is required to provide Information of a disclosing Party to any court or government agency pursuant to a written court order, subpoena, regulatory demand, request under the National Labor Relations Act (an \"NLRA Request\"), or process of law, the receiving Party must, unless prohibited by applicable Law, first provide the disclosing Party with prompt written notice of such requirement and reasonable cooperation to the disclosing Party should it seek protective arrangements for the production of such Information.

The \"Proportionate Share\" payable by Vendor shall be a portion of the Covered Loss determined, not at AT&T's sole discretion, but rather on an objectively fair and equitable basis (taking into account the relevant facts and circumstances and using the same standards that would be applied by a court or other neutral adjudicator under applicable Law) to be attributable to Vendor based on the relative materiality of the role played by the applicable Provided Elements in the Combination Claim. If Vendor believes AT&T's assessment of Vendor's Proportionate Share is not fair and equitable, then Vendor's Proportionate Share shall be determined, insofar as possible, through good faith negotiation between the Parties; provided, however, that a failure of the Parties to agree on Vendor's Proportionate Share shall not relieve Vendor of its obligations to pay its Proportionate Share under this Section. Vendor shall make payments in satisfaction of its Proportionate Share obligation whenever such payments become due. In no event shall Vendor be liable, with regard to a Combination Claim, for more than its Proportionate Share. If the Parties cannot mutually agree on Vendor's Proportionate Share within sixty (60) days of AT&T's providing Vendor with AT&T's assessment of Vendor's Proportionate Share, either Party may notify the other Party that a dispute has occurred, at which point the Parties shall follow the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 4.8 (\"Dispute Resolution\"), provided that in preparation for the escalation set forth in Section 4.8(a), Vendor shall notify AT&T in writing of the percentage which Vendor believes, in good faith, constitutes Vendor's Proportionate Share (\"Vendor's Minimum Share\"). If arbitration is invoked under Section 4.8(b), all arbitrators shall be qualified by education, training, and experience in both the intellectual property law (e.g., patent law) and the technology relevant to any dispute under this Section. Throughout the course of attempting to resolve the dispute, Vendor shall continue to pay Vendor's Minimum Share to AT&T as such payments become due. When Vendor's Proportionate Share is finally determined (either through escalation or arbitration, as the case may be) (\"Determined Proportionate Share\"), there shall be a true-up and Vendor shall promptly pay to AT&T the aggregate amount of past underpayments (i.e., the difference between monies previously due computed at the Determined Proportionate Share, minus those amounts that Vendor had actually paid to AT&T), if any. Thereafter, Vendor shall promptly pay its Determined Proportionate Share. (In the event that the Determined Proportionate Share is less than the Vendor's Minimum Share, AT&T shall refund to Vendor any past overpayments.)

Vendor shall cooperate with AT&T to facilitate the defense and may, at its option and at its own expense, participate with AT&T in the defense with counsel of its own choosing. Where AT&T controls the defense under this Subsection (b)(iii), AT&T shall make good faith efforts to enter into a reasonable joint defense or common interest agreement with Vendor.\n\n(iv) Insofar as Vendor's obligations under Subsection (b)(i) result from, arise out of, or relate to a Covered Claim other than a Compound Claim, Vendor shall have the discretion, but not the obligation, to control the defense of the Covered Claim. In the event that Vendor controls the defense of the Covered Claim, Vendor shall retain as its lead counsel, subject to AT&T's approval (which shall not be withheld, conditioned or delayed except for reasons of apparent or actual conflict of interest), one or more competent attorneys from a nationally recognized law firm who have significant experience in litigating intellectual property claims of the type at issue, and the AT&T Indemnified Parties may, at their option and sole expense, participate with Vendor in the defense of such Covered Claim.\n\n(v) AT&T shall notify Vendor promptly of any Covered Claim; provided, however, that any delay in such notice shall not relieve Vendor of its obligations under this Section, except insofar as Vendor can show that such delay actually and materially prejudiced Vendor.\n\n(vi) In no event shall Vendor settle, without AT&T's prior written consent, any Covered Claim, in whole or in part, in a manner that would require any AT&T Indemnified Party to discontinue or materially modify its products or services (or offerings thereof). In no event shall Vendor enter into any agreement related to any Covered Claim or to the Intellectual Property Rights asserted therein that discharges or mitigates Vendor's liability to the third-party claimant but fails to fully discharge all of AT&T's liabilities as to the Covered Loss.\n\n(c) Continued Use of Provided Elements Upon Injunction. Without in any manner limiting the foregoing indemnification, if, as a result of a Covered Claim, (i) the AT&T Indemnified Parties' rights under this Agreement are restricted or diminished, or (ii) an injunction, exclusion order, or other order from a court, arbitrator or other competent tribunal or governmental authority preventing or restricting the AT&T Indemnified Parties' use or enjoyment of the Provided Elements is issued, imminent, or reasonably likely to be issued, then, in addition to its other obligations set forth in this Section, Vendor, in any case at its sole expense (or, in the case of a Combination Claim, at its fairly and equitably apportioned expense) and at no loss, cost or damage to the AT&T Indemnified Parties or their customers, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain for the AT&T Indemnified Parties the right to continue using or conducting other activities with respect to the Provided Elements (or, in the case of a Combination Claim, shall use commercially reasonable efforts, in cooperation as reasonably needed with other interested parties, to obtain for the AT&T Indemnified Parties the right to continue using or conducting other activities with respect to the Provided Elements in the combination at issue); provided that if Vendor is unable to obtain such right, then Vendor\n\nProprietary and Confidential This Agreement and information contained therein is not for use or disclosure outside of AT&T, its Affiliates, and third party representatives, and Vendor except under written agreement by the contracting parties. 23\n\nSource: ATN INTERNATIONAL, INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nshall, after consulting with and obtaining the written approval of the AT&T Indemnified Parties, provide modified or replacement non-infringing Provided Elements that are (or, in the case of a Combination Claim, shall use commercially reasonable efforts, in cooperation as reasonably needed with other interested parties, to provide a modified or replacement non- infringing combination, with the Provided Elements being modified or replaced as needed therein, that is) equally suitable and functionally equivalent while retaining the quality of the original Provided Elements and complying fully with all the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement and all Specifications; provided further that if Vendor is unable in this way to provide such modified or replacement non-infringing Provided Elements, then AT&T shall have the right, at its option and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that AT&T has in contract, law or equity: (1) to exercise any of the Termination Remedies set forth in the Build Addendum and to terminate AT&T's obligations under this Agreement with respect to the impacted Cell Sites and receive a reduction in the Maintenance Fees with respect to such Cell Site(s), and/or (2) to require Vendor, as applicable, to remove, accept return of, or discontinue the provision of the Provided Elements, to refund to AT&T the purchase price thereof or other monies paid therefor (subject, in the case of Provided Elements other than services, to reduction based on the amount of depreciation or amortization over the useful life of the Provided Elements at issue), and to reimburse AT&T for any and all reasonable out-of- pocket expenses of removing, returning or discontinuing such Provided Elements.\n\n(d) Elimination of Charges.

To the extent that any disclosure required to be made by Vendor to the Securities and Exchange Commission has been previously reviewed by AT&T, then Vendor shall not be required to provide AT&T with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon prior to such disclosure being made thereafter so long as no substantive changes have been made thereto. A breach of this \"Publicity\" Section shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.\n\n3.31 Records and Audits\n\n(a) Vendor shall maintain complete and accurate records relating to the Work and the performance of this Agreement. AT&T and its auditors (including internal audit staff and external auditors) and governmental authorities shall have the right to review such records (\"AT&T Audits\") held and created by Vendor, to verify the following:\n\n(i) the accuracy of Vendor's invoices and AT&T's payment obligations hereunder;\n\n(ii) that the Work charged for was actually performed;\n\n(iii) that the Services have been and are being provided in accordance with this Agreement;\n\n(iv) the integrity of Vendor's systems that process, store, support, maintain, and transmit AT&T data;\n\n(v) Vendor's records relating to the performance of Vendor's Subcontractors with respect to any portion of the Services; and\n\n(vi) that Vendor and its Subcontractors are complying with Section 3.6 hereof.\n\nWhen the FirstNet Authority or other governmental authority requests to review Vendor's records, AT&T and its auditors will review these records first if the FirstNet Authority or other governmental authority permits such review, and provide the records to the requesting governmental authority; provided, however, the FirstNet Authority and other governmental authorities retain the right to perform audits independent of AT&T.\n\nProprietary and Confidential This Agreement and information contained therein is not for use or disclosure outside of AT&T, its Affiliates, and third party representatives, and Vendor except under written agreement by the contracting parties. 34\n\nSource: ATN INTERNATIONAL, INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Subject to Subsection (g) below, Vendor shall provide and shall require that its Subcontractors provide to AT&T, its auditors (including internal audit staff and external auditors), and governmental authorities access at all reasonable times to:\n\n(i) any facility at which the Services or any portion thereof are being performed;\n\n(ii) systems and assets used to provide the Services or any portion thereof;\n\n(iii) Vendor employees and Subcontractor employees providing the Services or any portion thereof; and\n\n(iv) all Vendor and Subcontractor records, including financial records relating to the invoices and payment obligations and supporting documentation, pertaining to the Services.\n\nThe scope of AT&T Audits shall also include:\n\n(i) practices and procedures used in performing the Services;\n\n(ii) systems, communications and information technology used in performing the Services;\n\n(iii) general controls and security practices and procedures;\n\n(iv) supporting information and calculations regarding invoices and compliance with service requirements;\n\n(v) quality initiatives and quality assurance; and\n\n(vi) compliance with the terms of this Agreement.\n\nAT&T's access to the records and other supporting documentation shall include the right to inspect and photocopy Vendor's documentation and the documentation of its Subcontractors as provided to Vendor, and the right to retain copies thereof outside of their physical location with appropriate safeguards, if such retention is deemed reasonably necessary by AT&T and only to the extent that all such records are maintained by AT&T in accordance with Section 3.16 hereof.\n\n(c) AT&T Audits may be conducted once a year (or more frequently if requested by governmental authorities who regulate AT&T's business, if required by applicable Law or if auditors require follow-up access to complete audit inquiries or if an audit uncovers any problems or deficiencies), upon at least ten (10) business days advance notice (unless otherwise mandated by Law) and during business hours. Vendor will cooperate, and will ensure that its Subcontractors cooperate, in the AT&T Audits, and will make the information reasonably required to conduct the AT&T Audits available on a timely basis.\n\n(d) If, as a result of an AT&T Audit, AT&T determines that Vendor has not performed or has unsatisfactorily performed any obligation under this Agreement, then Vendor will promptly remedy the non-performance or unsatisfactory performance.\n\nProprietary and Confidential This Agreement and information contained therein is not for use or disclosure outside of AT&T, its Affiliates, and third party representatives, and Vendor except under written agreement by the contracting parties. 35\n\nSource: ATN INTERNATIONAL, INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) Vendor will maintain and retain the records set forth in Subsection (a) during the term of the Agreement and for three (3) years thereafter (unless a discovery or legal hold request is made with respect to such records, in which case Vendor shall retain such records until AT&T notifies Vendor that such discovery or legal hold request has expired). Vendor will provide AT&T, at AT&T's request and cost, with paper and electronic copies of documents and information reasonably necessary to verify Vendor's compliance with this Agreement. Upon notification by AT&T of a discovery or legal hold request, Vendor shall fully cooperate with such request and immediately preserve any Vendor records covered by such request and promptly provide such Vendor records requested by AT&T related to the inquiry.\n\n(f) Except as provided in Subsection (d), all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by AT&T in connection with an AT&T Audit shall be paid by AT&T. Vendor shall be solely responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by Vendor in connection with its obligations under this Section. In the event that either Party requires that an audit be performed by an independent auditor, unless otherwise specified herein, the Party requesting such independent auditor will be responsible for the costs and expenses associated with the independent auditor.\n\n(g) With respect to AT&T requests for audits or inspections of Vendor's Subcontractors, the following applies:\n\n(i) If Vendor's agreement with its applicable Subcontractor permits an AT&T Audit, AT&T shall be permitted to conduct such audit directly or through a third party representative. Vendor shall work with AT&T in facilitating the Subcontractor's cooperation for an expeditious and thorough audit or inspection.\n\n(ii) If Vendor's contract with its applicable Subcontractor precludes AT&T from directly conducting an audit or inspection, Vendor shall use reasonable best efforts to enable AT&T to perform an audit of the Subcontractor with Vendor coordinating the audit process. Failing those efforts, Vendor shall, upon AT&T's request and at AT&T's expense, conduct the audit or inspection on behalf of AT&T, subject to terms agreed to by Vendor and AT&T for the Subcontractor audit, such as areas to be audited, applicable fees, and the timeframe for reporting audit results to AT&T. If AT&T's request for a Vendor audit or inspection arises from, in AT&T's good faith opinion, materially or consistently deficient Service provided by the Subcontractor under AT&T's account, and the audit in both Parties' opinions confirms such deficiencies, Vendor shall not charge AT&T a fee for the Vendor's audit of its Subcontractor.\n\n(iii) If Vendor's contract with its applicable Subcontractor does not allow Vendor access to the facilities and systems of Subcontractor required to conduct the audit described in Subsection (b) above, then Vendor shall provide a list of such Subcontractors and the services being provided by such Subcontractor to AT&T for its review. To the extent AT&T deems it reasonably necessary to require such access, then Vendor will renegotiate its contract with the applicable Subcontractor in order to obtain the audit rights described in Subsection (b) above.\n\nProprietary and Confidential This Agreement and information contained therein is not for use or disclosure outside of AT&T, its Affiliates, and third party representatives, and Vendor except under written agreement by the contracting parties. 36\n\nSource: ATN INTERNATIONAL, INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n3.32 Restricted Entities. Vendor may not deliver or obtain any Material or Deliverables from or use any Restricted Entities to provide any Services under this Agreement, without prior written consent from AT&T. Vendor may not use, in connection with any Deliverable, Material or Service provided hereunder, any element, equipment, location, instrumentality or the like where a Restricted Entity has a security interest in that element, equipment, location, instrumentality or the like. Vendor may not obtain financing from any Restricted Entity or use any Cell Sites or Material owned, leased from, operated or financed by any Restricted Entity.\n\n3.33 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force if both the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not affected in any manner that is materially adverse to either Party by severing the provision determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable.\n\n3.34 Supplier Citizenship and Sustainability. Vendor shall conduct business with an abiding respect for corporate citizenship, sustainability, and human rights (\"Citizenship and Sustainability\"). Upon AT&T's request, which request may only be made once per calendar year, Vendor shall provide to AT&T reasonable information, reports, or survey responses to demonstrate Vendor's operation of its business in the context of Citizenship and Sustainability.\n\n3.35 Survival of Obligations.

All such taxes must be stated as separate items on the applicable Material, Deliverable, or Services invoice listing the taxing jurisdiction imposing the tax. Installation, labor and other non-taxable charges must be separately stated. AT&T shall pay all applicable taxes to Vendor that are stated on and at the time the Material, Deliverables, or Services invoice is submitted by Vendor. Vendor shall remit taxes to the appropriate taxing authorities. Vendor shall honor tax exemption certificates, and other appropriate documents, which AT&T provides to Vendor, pursuant to relevant tax provisions of the taxing jurisdiction providing the exemption.\n\nProprietary and Confidential This Agreement and information contained therein is not for use or disclosure outside of AT&T, its Affiliates, and third party representatives, and Vendor except under written agreement by the contracting parties. 37\n\nSource: ATN INTERNATIONAL, INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2019\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Vendor will pay any penalty, interest, additional tax, or other charge that may be levied or assessed as a result of the delay or failure of Vendor, for any reason other than AT&T's failure to reimburse Vendor in a timely manner for such amounts, to pay any tax or file any return or information required by law, rule, or regulation or by this Agreement to be paid or filed by Vendor.\n\n(c) Upon AT&T's request, the Parties shall consult with respect to the basis and rates upon which Vendor shall pay any taxes or fees for which AT&T is obligated to reimburse Vendor under this Agreement. If AT&T determines that, in good faith and pursuant to applicable Law, any such taxes or fees are not payable or should be paid on a basis less than the full price or at rates less than the full tax rate, AT&T shall notify Vendor in writing of such determinations, Vendor shall make payment in accordance with such determinations, and AT&T shall be responsible for such determinations. If collection is sought by the taxing authority for a greater amount of taxes than that so determined by AT&T, Vendor shall promptly notify AT&T. If AT&T desires to contest such collection, AT&T shall promptly notify Vendor. Vendor shall cooperate with AT&T in contesting such determination, but AT&T shall be responsible and shall reimburse Vendor for any tax, interest, or penalty in excess of AT&T's determination and shall reimburse Vendor for Litigation Expense incurred by Vendor in connection with contesting such determination.\n\n(d) If the parties agree, where such agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed, that AT&T has paid Vendor for any taxes in excess of the amount that AT&T is obligated to pay Vendor under this Agreement, AT&T and Vendor shall consult in good faith to determine the appropriate method(s) to seek recovery of such excess payments, which method(s) may include, but are not limited to, (i) Vendor crediting any excess payments against tax amounts or other payments due from AT&T solely to the extent Vendor has successfully made corresponding adjustments to its payments to the relevant tax authority, (ii) Vendor timely filing claims for refund and any other documents required to recover any excess payments and Vendor promptly remitting to AT&T all such refunds and interest received, and (iii) Vendor immediately refunding to AT&T such excess payments.\n\n(e) If any taxing authority advises Vendor that it intends to audit Vendor with respect to any taxes for which AT&T is obligated to reimburse Vendor under this Agreement, Vendor shall (i) promptly so notify AT&T, (ii) afford AT&T an opportunity to participate with Vendor in such audit with respect to such taxes, and (iii) keep AT&T fully informed as to the progress of such audit. Except as set forth in Subsection (c) above, each Party shall bear its own expenses with respect to any such audit, and the responsibility for any additional tax, interest, or penalty resulting from such audit is to be determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Section 3.36. Vendor's failure to comply with the notification requirements of this Section 3.36 will relieve AT&T of its responsibility to reimburse Vendor for taxes only to the extent that Vendor's failure actually and materially prejudiced AT&T's ability to contest imposition or assessment of those taxes.\n\n(f) In addition to its rights under Subsections (c), (d), and (e) above with respect to any tax or tax controversy covered by this Section 3.36, AT&T is entitled to contest, pursuant to applicable Law and tariffs and at its own expense, any tax previously invoiced that AT&T is ultimately\n\nProprietary and Confidential This Agreement and information contained therein is not for use or disclosure outside of AT&T, its Affiliates, and third party representatives, and Vendor except under written agreement by the contracting parties. 38\n\nSource: ATN INTERNATIONAL, INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nobligated to pay. AT&T is entitled to the benefit of any refund or recovery of amounts actually received by AT&T or Vendor that AT&T has previously paid to Vendor resulting from such a contest. Vendor shall cooperate in any such contest, but AT&T shall reimburse Vendor for Litigation Expense incurred by Vendor in obtaining a refund or credit for AT&T.\n\n(g) If either Party is audited by a taxing authority or other governmental entity in connection with taxes under this Section 3.36, the other Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Party being audited in order to respond to any audit inquiries in an appropriate and timely manner, so that the audit and any resulting controversy may be resolved expeditiously.\n\n(h) AT&T and Vendor shall reasonably cooperate with each other with respect to any tax planning to minimize taxes.\n\n(i) Vendor and any of its Affiliates, as appropriate, receiving payments hereunder shall provide AT&T with a valid United States Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN- E, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, W- 8IMY, or W-9 (or any successor form prescribed by the IRS). AT&T may reduce any payment otherwise due to Vendor in connection with the sale of Material, Delivery of Deliverables, or provision of Services under this Agreement by the amount of any tax imposed on Vendor that AT&T is required to pay directly to a taxing or other governmental authority (\"Withholding Tax\"). Alternatively, if applicable Law permits, AT&T agrees that it will honor a valid exemption certificate or other mandated document evidencing Vendor's exemption from payment of, or liability for, any Withholding Tax as authorized or required by statute, regulation, administrative pronouncement, or other Law of the jurisdiction providing said exemption. AT&T shall provide Vendor with documentation evidencing withholding in a reasonable time.\n\n3.37 Termination and Suspension\n\n(a) Mutual Agreement - This Agreement, the Build Addendum and/or the Maintenance Addendum may be terminated at any time upon the mutual written consent of the Parties.\n\n(b) Termination for Convenience - This Agreement, the Build Addendum and the Maintenance Addendum may not be terminated by either Party at any time for its own convenience.\n\n(c) Termination for Cause\n\n(i) If either Party breaches any provision of this Agreement (which for purposes of this Section 3.37(c) shall not mean any breaches of the Build Addendum or Maintenance Addendum) and (i) if the breach is one that by its nature could be cured, and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days (or such other applicable cure period expressly provided herein and applicable to such breach) after the breaching Party receives written notice, provided that if such breach is not reasonably susceptible of cure within such thirty (30) day period (or such other applicable cure period) and Vendor is diligently and continuously pursuing a cure, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to establish by mutual written agreement a reasonable extension of the applicable cure period, or (ii) if the breach is one that by its nature cannot be cured, or (iii) if the breach is a material violation of Laws that is not reasonably susceptible of cure, then, in addition to all other rights and remedies at law or\n\nProprietary and Confidential This Agreement and information contained therein is not for use or disclosure outside of AT&T, its Affiliates, and third party representatives, and Vendor except under written agreement by the contracting parties. 39\n\nSource: ATN INTERNATIONAL, INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nin equity or otherwise, the non-breaching Party shall have the right upon written notice to immediately terminate this Agreement (which termination shall include the Build Addendum and Maintenance Addendum), and exercise all Termination Remedies set forth in the Build Addendum, except AT&T cannot terminate its obligation to pay Vendor all Structured Payments for Cell Sites that have achieved Location Acceptance prior to the effective date of termination or any Maintenance Fees for Services performed under the Maintenance Addendum prior to the effective date of such termination. Failure of the non- breaching Party to immediately terminate this Agreement (x) following a breach which continues longer than such cure period, provided such breach has not been cured prior to the non-breaching Party's providing notice of termination, or (y) following a breach that cannot be cured or that constitutes a material violation of Laws that is not reasonably susceptible to cure shall not constitute a waiver of the non- breaching Party's rights to terminate.\n\n(ii) If Vendor becomes insolvent or generally fails to pay, or admits in writing its inability or refusal to pay, debts as they become due, then AT&T shall have the right upon written notice to immediately terminate AT&T's obligations under this Agreement or the Build Addendum or Maintenance Addendum, as applicable, and exercise all Termination Remedies set forth in the Build Addendum.\n\n(iii) If (1) Vendor (A) receives a notice of default (or similar breach or violation) and has not cured such default (or similar breach or violation) within thirty (30) days from the receipt of such notice or (B) is in default under any credit facility or other financing arrangement, (2) any Vendor credit facility or other financing arrangement has been terminated or suspended (other than by Vendor or as a result of an expiration in accordance with its terms) or (3) Vendor no longer has access to funding under any credit facility or other financing arrangement required by Vendor to fulfill its obligations to AT&T under this Agreement, the Master License Agreement, the Transport Agreement and the Roaming Agreement (as such term is defined in the Build Addendum), then Vendor shall promptly, but no later than one (1) business day following Vendor's receipt of notice of any such event, notify AT&T of such event and in addition to all other rights and remedies at law or in equity or otherwise, AT&T shall have the right upon written notice to immediately terminate AT&T's obligations under this Agreement or the Build Addendum or Maintenance Addendum, as applicable, and exercise all Termination Remedies set forth in the Build Addendum; provided, that prior to exercising such termination right, AT&T shall enter into good faith discussions with Vendor to determine if Vendor can obtain alternative financing.\n\n(d) Bankruptcy.

The Parties acknowledge that the Build Addendum and Maintenance Addendum include specific partial termination rights on a Cell Site by Cell Site basis, including the Termination Remedies that allow for termination of AT&T's obligations with respect to an individual Cell Site hereunder and special remedies to AT&T in connection with such termination.\n\n(g) Termination Charges - AT&T shall not be liable for any termination charges (or any charges for any Material or Services already ordered or performed at the time of termination) in any case when any termination results from a termination right granted to AT&T in this Agreement; provided that AT&T shall remain obligated to make Structured Payments with respect to any Cell Sites that have reached Location Acceptance prior to the effective date of such termination and pay any Maintenance Fees for Services performed under the Maintenance Addendum prior to the effective date of such termination.\n\n(h) Obligations upon Expiration or Termination - Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, but prior to the effectiveness of full termination of the Agreement, AT&T may exercise any rights and remedies available to AT&T under this Agreement, at law or in equity, including AT&T's right to exercise any one or more of the Termination Remedies set forth in the Build Addendum, and Vendor shall, upon the request and at the expense (other than termination in accordance with Subsection (c) hereof) of AT&T: (i) return all papers, materials, equipment, assets and property of AT&T held by Vendor, including title and ownership to all Material, (ii) provide reasonable assistance as may be necessary for the orderly, non-disrupted continuation of the Services, (iii) transfer all of the contracts related to the Cell Sites to AT&T\n\nProprietary and Confidential This Agreement and information contained therein is not for use or disclosure outside of AT&T, its Affiliates, and third party representatives, and Vendor except under written agreement by the contracting parties. 41\n\nSource: ATN INTERNATIONAL, INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nas contemplated in the Build Addendum and (iv) reimburse AT&T for any AT&T Provided Equipment or other assets that are not installed at a Cell Site and cannot be returned in good working order (based on the acquisition costs plus taxes and shipping costs).

Vendor agrees to pay the third party administrator an annual fee for the performance of these administrative functions, which annual fee shall not exceed three hundred dollars ($300.00), and a one-time set-up fee of thirty dollars ($30.00).

In that event, if Vendor cannot or will not use such alternate FOSS, then AT&T may immediately terminate the relevant purchase or funding commitments under this Agreement, without further cost, expense or liability to AT&T.\n\n(c) Vendor represents and warrants to AT&T: (i) that Vendor has satisfied all its obligations to any third parties with respect to all FOSS and the applicable FOSS licenses (including, for example, any obligation to make publicly available the FOSS source code for modifications to such FOSS); (ii) that the FOSS, in the form provided to AT&T, is suitable for the intent and purposes furnished hereunder; (iii) that use of the FOSS in such form for such intent and purposes in no manner creates any added obligation on the part of AT&T (including, for example, the payment of any additional monies), or diminishes, conditions or eliminates any of the rights, title, or interest that Vendor grants AT&T in or to any Deliverables or that Vendor may otherwise provide AT&T under this Agreement; and (iv) that use of the FOSS in such form for such intent and purposes, including, but not limited to, AT&T's use or combination of the FOSS, in the form provided to AT&T, with any proprietary software of AT&T or AT&T's third-party Contractors, does not subject AT&T to any obligation of disclosure or distribution to any third party or to the public of any such proprietary software, or otherwise make such proprietary software subject to the terms of any FOSS license or impair AT&T's or its third-party Contractors' rights, title, or interest in or to such proprietary software.\n\n(d) In the event that AT&T notifies Vendor or Vendor becomes aware of Vendor's noncompliance with any FOSS license term, then in either case, Vendor shall use all reasonable efforts promptly to cure such noncompliance so as to eliminate risks of public disclosure of proprietary software and prevent disruption of any AT&T business activity. Vendor shall promptly notify AT&T of all actions taken by Vendor to cure such noncompliance. Should AT&T receive notice from any third party alleging acts or omissions which, notwithstanding AT&T's use of the FOSS for the intent and purposes furnished hereunder, constitute noncompliance with any FOSS license term, then promptly upon AT&T's notice to Vendor of such allegation, Vendor shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T against such allegation in accordance with Vendor's obligations to do so as set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, in a manner that preserves any proprietary software of AT&T or its third-party Contractors from any public disclosure obligation or any other FOSS license noncompliance allegations.\n\n5.1 Execution of Agreement\n\n5.1 Transmission of Original Signatures and Executing Multiple Counterparts.

The Identifiable Losses and Non-identifiable losses shall be  distributed among the Senders according to the provisions in the Procedure for Adjustments for Volumetric Compensation for Quality.     13.1.2.2 Increases or reductions necessary to be made as a result of making adjustments for Volumetric Compensation.     13.2 Accounting for losses     13.2.1 The volume of all Crude Oil losses produced in the system shall be calculated by the Transporter using its best Operational and engineering  judgment.     13.3 Process to determine quantities and qualities at the Points of Entrance and Points of Exit.     13.3.1 Quantity measurements and quality sampling of deliveries and withdrawals (including calibration of instruments) shall be the Transporter's  responsibility and shall be made according to the standards and accepted prevailing practices by the API and the ASTM. The installed equipment  to conduct measurements and sampling shall be determined by the Transporter.     13.3.2 The Transporter shall ensure to set out adequate measuring and calibration procedures at the nodes of Entrance and nodes of Exit.  Calibration of the measuring systems shall be made as required by operating circumstances under the Transporter's criteria. The calibration factor  of the meters shall be effective only after the date of the latest calibration except in case of manifest error in which case the last factor of valid  calibration shall be applied.     13.3.3 The Transporter has the responsibility to take two samples of representative Crude Oil according to the API standards and with the  adequate volume for each delivery and withdrawal made. The frequency of such sampling shall be determined occasionally by the Transporter  based on the continuity of the Crude's quality among other factors. Samples shall be used for the following purposes:\n\n\n\n  23\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    13.3.3.1 To determine the quality.     13.3.3.2 The Transporter shall retain a sample for each delivery and withdrawal, which shall be used as a counter-sample. The Transporter shall  preserve said sample for a period no longer than 15 calendar days in case there are any claims regarding a specific delivery or withdrawal. After  this lapse of time it will not be possible to make any claims in this sense.     13.3.4 Crude volumes that the Transporter shall be committed to transport shall be determined using the measurement systems of the Pipeline  following the API and ASTM standards. The Transporter shall ensure the filling in of all official forms for each kind of measurement, which shall  contain as a minimum the following information: the date, the readings of the meters or the measures of the storage tank or tanks before starting  and upon completion of the deliveries or withdrawals, the API gravity, densities, temperatures, pressures, sediment and water percentages and any  other necessary characteristic for its identification. The forms above mentioned constitute documents, which shall be used to make calculations for  the Transportation value and the adjustment for volumetric compensation and shall serve as proving documents for any other purpose.     13.3.5 At any time before starting any delivery or withdrawal and in intervals with a frequency not higher than two (2) times per month, the Sender  may inspect, through an independent inspector, with previous approval from the Transporter, the accuracy of the results of the measurements and  the samples taken to determine the quantity and quality of the Hydrocarbon. The Sender shall bear the cost of said inspection. For this purpose  the respective Sender shall notify the Transporter the name and title of the independent inspector at least five business days before the  measurement of the corresponding Crude.     13.3.6 The calibration of the measurement equipment shall be made as required by the Operational circumstances or by written request received  from a Sender in particular under the Transporter's judgment. The meters factors shall be updated every time this procedure is conducted. Prior to  the calibration of the meters, the Transporter shall notify the Senders the dates in which said calibration shall be carried out so that they if deemed  necessary, may be present in the calibration. The meters calibration factor shall be effective only after the date of the last calibration and the  parties participating in the calibration shall issue a certificate; otherwise this shall be documented in a letter from the Transporter to the Senders.     13.3.7 Pursuant to API recommendations, testers shall be re-calibrated at least once every five years (from the date of the last calibration) o  immediately after any alteration in the measuring section.\n\n\n\n  24\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    13.3.8 The Hydrocarbon volumes that the Transporter accepts and schedules for its Transportation shall be determined by meters installed in the  nodes of Entrance and/or Exit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Transporter may use alternate methods included in the API standards. If the  static measurement of tanks is used, these must have their measurement approved by the Ministry of Mines and Energy or the competent entity.  The tank measurement shall be determined following the current existing standards for such purpose.     CLAUSE 14 VOLUMETRIC COMPENSATION FOR QUALITY     14.1 The Regulations of Volumetric Compensation for Quality is an integral part of this Manual as annex 1 (MECHANISMS OF COMPENSATION  OF QUALITY FOR THE MIX OF CRUDE OILS).     14.2 Each of the Senders shall deliver to the Transporter at a Point of Entrance a Hydrocarbon volume which, and only for purposes of Volumetric  Compensation for Quality (CVC), shall be valued according to the procedure defined for the Pipeline and in accordance with its particular quality.  This quality shall be determined by an independent quantity and quality inspector accepted and recognized both by the Transporter and the  Sender.     14.3 Considering that as a result of the Transportation the Hydrocarbons delivered in the Pipeline are mixed without distinction, each Sender shall  withdraw at the Point of Exit a volume of Hydrocarbons with a different quality than its Hydrocarbon delivered, except when it has been requested  and has been accepted the Transportation of Hydrocarbons in a segregated manner. The quality of this segregated Hydrocarbon shall also be  determined by an independent quantity and quality inspector accepted and recognized both by the Transporter and the Senders. This  Hydrocarbon shall be assessed only for purposes of Volumetric Compensation for Quality and shall take into account the compensation for  quality due to the interfaces occurring when transported with other Crude Oils.     14.4 The Transporter shall apply the mechanism of Volumetric Compensation for Quality defined by the same for the Pipeline which shall have the  following main characteristics:     14.4.1 The Senders who have delivered to the Transporter Hydrocarbons with a better quality than the mixed Hydrocarbon withdrawn at the Point  of Exit of the Pipeline shall be entitled to compensation in volume, equivalent to the volumes that Senders who have delivered Hydrocarbons of  lower quality than the ones withdrawn at the Point of Exit will have to assume. For such purpose, individual qualities of all volumes delivered and  withdrawn shall be taken into account as well as the final inventories of the preceding month of Operation and the last month of Operation, with its  respective qualities.\n\n\n\n  25\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    14.4.2 The Volumetric Compensation for Quality shall be internal between the Senders in such a way that the final volumetric balances equal cero  and the Transporter shall neither charge nor Pay any volume for this purpose and shall only serve as a mediator, regulator, liquidator and  responsible for the volumetric distribution of the compensations.     14.4.3 The Volumetric Compensation for Quality is not part of the Rate and therefore shall not be compensated or will have any variation as a result  of this.     14.5 In each month of Operation the Transporter shall make a balance of the existing volumes and qualities at the beginning of the month delivered  to the Pipeline, lost, withdrawn and existing at the end of the month, both for the total of Hydrocarbons as well as for individual Hydrocarbons of  each Sender.     14.6 The Sender shall hold the Transporter and owner harmless against any cost, action, claim, intended procedures by any Third parties, losses  and all damage and obligations incurred and inherent to the mix of Hydrocarbons in the Transportation process and the Volumetric Compensation  for Quality.     14.7 In any case the Transporter may modify the mechanism of Volumetric Compensation for Quality contained herein, in the respective annexes  and all other documents in connection with the CVC.     14.8 Senders of a specific Hydrocarbon may agree with the Transporter not to apply the Volumetric Compensation for Quality to said  Hydrocarbon. The foregoing shall be applicable as long as the Hydrocarbon of other Senders is not affected negatively.     14.9 By agreement between the totality of Senders and the Transporter, it may be decided not to implement the Volumetric Compensation for  Quality (CVC) for Crude Oils transported through the system. In this case the Transporter may implement any other mechanism validated with the  Senders to carry out the volumetric balances.     CLAUSE 15 BULLETIN OF TRANSORTATION BY THE PIPELINE - BTO     15.1 The Transporter shall implement the Bulletin of Transportation by the Pipeline - BTO - which shall contain as a minimum the following  information:     15.2 Information of public access:     15.2.1 General description of the Pipeline     15.2.2 Current rates for each Distance     15.2.3 Value tables or current calculation formulas of Monetary Conditions     15.2.4 Design Capacity of the Pipeline and Nominal Capacity\n\n\n\n  26\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    15.2.5 Monthly available Capacity of the Pipeline estimated for the next (6) months and annual for the next five (5) years.     15.2.6 Excerpts of this Manual corresponding to connection requests, nomination process and minimum quality requirements of Crude Oil     15.3 Information of exclusive access for Senders and Third parties:     15.3.1 This valid Manual.     15.3.2 Discussion on modifications to the Manual     15.3.3 General information on the programmed maintenance schedule of the Pipeline and other programed activities affecting the effective Capacity  during the next six (6) months.     15.3.4 Listing of expansion projects and changes in the Pipeline's infrastructure     15.3.5 Effective Capacity confirmed for each month of Operation and estimated for the following five (5) months and the corresponding available  Capacity for each Distance.     15.3.6 Transportation program for the month of Operation and tentative for the following (5) months for each Distance     15.3.7 Description of the mechanism established by the Transporter and foreseen in the nomination process to assign the available Capacity  equitably     15.3.8 Last volumetric balance prepared for the Pipeline.     15.3.9 Daily statistics for the last month of Operation and monthly statistics since the enforcement of Resolution 181258 of 2010 from the Ministry  of Mines and Energy on the information on Effective Capacity and Volumetric Balances.     15.3.10 The annual rates and the Monetary Conditions for each Distance from the date of enforcement of Resolution 181258 of 2010 from the  Ministry of Mines and Energy.     15.4 The Transporter is no obliged to publish any information of reserved character.     15.5 The Transporter shall provide to Senders and any Third parties interested in transporting Hydrocarbons through the Pipeline as requested,  within the following ten (10) calendar days after the request and with previous verification from the Transporter of their Capacity as Sender or  Third Party an access password to the information of exclusive character referred to in numeral 15.3 of this clause.

The Sender shall Pay the Transporter all costs incurred in the  analysis and eventual treatment of this Hydrocarbon to place it within the required specifications or to implement the scheme required for its  Transportation.     16.1.6 The Transporter shall be entitled, with a previous provisional notice, to remove and sell the Crude of any Sender that fails to comply with  any of the specifications at its Sole discretion. If the Transporter exercises its right of sale pursuant to this clause, the Transporter shall deduct  from the proceeds of such sale all costs incurred by the Transporter with respect to the storage, removal and sale of such Crude Oil. The  Transporter shall pay the balance to the Sender.\n\n\n\n  28\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    16.1.7 The Transporter shall not accept Crude Oil delivered by any Sender if this may cause impairment to the Pipeline of the Crudes or mixtures  transported (without consideration of whether or not the Crude Oil meets the minimum quality specifications).     16.1.8 The Transporter acting reasonably and in good faith, shall be entitled to make any changes to the minimum quality specifications of Crude  Oil in accordance with operating practices, which may be necessary or pertinent, including but without being limited to, prevent material damage or  the material degradation of the effective Capacity of the Pipeline in order to prevent any personal injuries or damage to the property or the  environment.     CLAUSE 17 REGULATIONS FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF SEGREGATED HYDROCARBON     17.1 With a previous request from the Sender or Third Party, the Transporter may accept the Transportation of segregated Hydrocarbon to the  extent that this is a technical and economically viable alternative. The Transportation of segregated Hydrocarbon cannot change the scheme set  out in clause 10 and shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions in this Manual.     17.2 As a consequence of the foregoing, the Transporter shall inform the Sender its disposition to start the Transportation of segregated  Hydrocarbon. The Transportation of segregated Hydrocarbon shall be subject to the nomination process set forth in this Manual.     17.3 Any additional charges for Transportation of segregated Hydrocarbon shall be borne by the Sender or Third Party requesting the service, and  it will be taken into account, including but without being limited, any costs and damage caused to the Transporter, owner or other Senders.     CLAUSE 18 RISKS AND RESPONSIBILITY     18.1 The Transporter shall exercise custody on the Hydrocarbon from the time the Sender or whoever the Sender designates, delivers it at the Point  of Entrance and until the Point of Exit.     18.2 Neither the Transporter nor the owner shall be responsible for the consequences of failing to comply with the deliveries and withdrawals  generated by the Sender in the Transportation program, commitments of operators and/or Transporters of Transportation systems connected to  the Pipeline.\n\n\n\n  29\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    18.3 The Transporter shall not be responsible for any damage or deterioration that a Hydrocarbon delivered by a Sender may suffer, such as  contamination with strange materials, contamination by contact of different types of Hydrocarbons if the damage or deterioration is due to  Justified Events. In the event any of the cases previously mentioned occurs, and one or more Senders are involved, all the Hydrocarbons affected  shall be prorated between the Senders in proportion to the ownership of each of the Hydrocarbons involved, without prejudice of any indemnities  afterwards which may be applicable between the Senders affected. The Transporter shall prepare the information corresponding to the volume of  Hydrocarbon affected and the proportion corresponding to each Sender.     18.4 The Transporter shall be responsible for the Transportation service, for any losses, damage or deterioration that the Hydrocarbon may suffer.  The Transporter shall be released from any responsibility in the Justified Events and the Transporter is not incurring in any gross negligence.     18.5 Any damage or prejudice caused to the Transporter by virtue of failing to comply with the regulations contained in this Manual by any  Sender shall be the responsibility of the Sender who shall indemnify the Transporter for such damage or prejudice.     18.6 Hydrocarbons delivered by each Sender and transported through the Pipeline may vary in their quality as a result of the mix with other  Hydrocarbons. Except for events in which segregated Hydrocarbons are transported, the Transporter shall not have any obligation to return at the  Point of Exit a Hydrocarbon of the same quality as the Hydrocarbon delivered for its Transportation at the Point of Entrance. The adjustments of  Volumetric Compensation for Quality shall be applied to the transported mixed Hydrocarbons.     18.7 In the Transportation of Hydrocarbon mix and Hydrocarbon segregated through the Pipeline, contamination fronts are generated. All Senders  of the Pipeline shall accept as withdrawn volume, a portion of the contamination fronts generated in the Transportation through the Pipeline. If the  Sender requires some special conditions for the Transportation of a Hydrocarbon, these shall be agreed with the Transporter who reserves the  right to accept them and require the Sender to bear all costs associated to such conditions.     18.8 The following shall be considered in the Transportation of Hydrocarbon mix and Hydrocarbon segregated through the Pipeline:     18.8.1 The Hydrocarbon of higher quality with respect to the Hydrocarbon of lower quality shall always be degraded in the contamination fronts.\n\n\n\n  30\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    18.8.2 The Transporter shall estimate a maximum volume corresponding to the contamination fronts and shall be responsible to comply with this  value.     18.9 The Transporter is obliged to return the Sender and the latter to withdraw at a Point of Exit, the volume of equivalent Hydrocarbon upon  application of the mechanism of Volumetric Compensation for Quality.     18.10 The Senders and Third parties shall indemnify and hold the Transporter and the owner harmless against any costs, claims, litigations, judicial  or extra-judicial action, and decisions of any kind, which may be brought against the Transporter or owner, and in general by any procedure  intended by any Third parties.

CLAUSE 30 APPLICABLE LEGISLATION     30.1 This Manual is governed in all its parts by the applicable regulations of the Republic of Colombia.\n\n\n\n  39\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1   ANNEX 1: MECHANISMS OF QUALITY COMPENSATION FOR THE MIXTURE OF CRUDE OIL     ADJUSTMENT PROCEDURES OR VOLUMETRIC BALANCES     The Transporter shall conduct the volumetric balance with a monthly frequency in order to establish the volumes injected by each Sender to the  Pipeline, the identifiable losses, the Non-identifiable losses, consumptions, inventory variations, and any adjustments for quality if the latter is  applicable.\n\n   For purposes of the procedure hereof, the provisions set out in the Manual of the Transporter for handling Losses in the Pipeline and in the annex  hereof shall be applied.\n\n   The Transporter assumes the totality of costs for consumption of Crude Oil.\n\n\n\n   In order to make equitable adjustments between the Senders of the Pipeline by the differences in value resulting for differences in  quality of Crude Oils delivered I the Pipeline, a procedure of volumetric compensation for quality shall be established (\"CVC\"  in  Spanish).     The purpose of the CVC is to establish a system to compensate Senders for the degradation or improvement of the Crude Oil withdrawn  compared with the Crude delivered. The Sender withdrawing a Crude o lower quality than the Crude delivered shall be compensated  with a higher volume. The Sender withdrawing a Crude with higher quality than the Crude delivered shall compensate others Senders of  better quality accepting a lower volume. At any rate, the sum of debits and credits by CVC for all Senders shall be cero.\n\n\n\n  1. LOSSES\n\n  2. CRUDE OIL CONSUMPTION\n\n  3. VOLUMETRIC COMPENSATION FOR QUALITY - CVC\n\n  3.1 When Crude Oils are delivered to the Pipeline of different quality and from different Senders, the result shall be a Crude Oil with  different characteristics of quality and market value than the Crude Oil delivered to the Pipeline by each of the Senders. Due to different  qualities of Crude Oil delivered to the Pipeline, some Senders shall withdraw Crude of higher value than the Oil delivered while others  shall withdraw Crude Oil with less value than the Oil delivered to the Pipeline.\n\n  40\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    At any node of Entrance of the Pipeline where two or more Crude Oil flows merge in order to be transported, a volumetric compensation  for quality shall be established on the resulting mix.\n\n   For purposes of the procedure hereof, the provisions in the Manual of the Transporter shall be applied for measurements in the  Pipeline.\n\n   The Transporter set out detailed procedures for the CVC following the guidelines established hereto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   For any month of Operation the corresponding quantity of Crude of each Sender shall be:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  3.2 SAMPLING AND SYSTEM MEASUREMENT\n\n  3.3 CVC PROCEDURES\n\n  3.3.1 The Transporter shall administer the CVC process and the Senders may audit the process or request reviews thereto as long as the  Transporter is timely informed and a working plan is coordinated between the parties.\n\n  3.3.2 The Transporter shall establish monthly the coefficients for adjustments of quality and sulfur pursuant to the criteria established  herein.\n\n  3.3.3 The CVC shall be settled in kind.\n\n  3.3.4 The Transporter shall make monthly adjustments to the corresponding volume of Crude to each Sender, based on the coefficients of  adjustment for quality.\n\n  (a) Reduced if such Sender of the Pipeline delivers Crude of lower quality than the average quality of the mix,\n\n  (b) Increased if said Sender of the Pipeline delivers Crude of ah higher quality than the average quality of the mix.\n\n  3.3.5 At the latest on the 15th day of the calendar month following the Operation, Senders shall report to the Transporter the export prices,  the API gravity and the sulfur content of its Crude for the Month of Operation.\n\n  41\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   The parties may jointly review:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   The API gravity and the sulfur content on the data base of the Crude quality are representative of the current qualities of Crude  which is being delivered.     The variability of the API gravity and sulfur is within an allowed tolerance to be determined by the parties. Analyses of sulfur  content shall be conducted based on a schedule agreed by the parties after the beginning of the Fiscal Year.\n\n   By means of using the Crude Oil basket of reference the variation of price shall be determined regarding the API grade and sulfur content for Crude  Oil delivered. The method is based on the use of the linear regression of prices of a Crude Oil basket of reference delivered in the coast of the Gulf  of The United States of America with API gravity and sulfur content.\n\n\n\n  3.3.6 Each month of Operation the Transporter shall measure the volumes delivered by the Senders and shall determine the weighted  average for the quality parameters of Crude Oils delivered.\n\n  3.3.7 The Transporter shall calculate the adjustments to the volume for each Sender and shall determine the Crude volume that  corresponds. No adjustment in the volume as a consequence of the CVC shall affect the Transportation fee that a Sender shall Pay to  the Transporter.\n\n  3.3.8 Senders acknowledge that adjustments to their Crude volumes to be withdrawn as a result of these principles and procedures of the  CVC may affect the volume of Crude Oil for a withdrawal afterwards.\n\n  3.3.9 Senders are entitled to review the Transporter's calculations regarding the adjustments by CVC and the due application of this  procedure.\n\n  (a) The appropriateness of the Crude Oil reference basket regarding their terms of quality.\n\n  (b) The information on prices available to the public.\n\n  (c) The calculations of the coefficients and the volumes adjusted.\n\n  3.3.10 A data base for the API gravity shall be developed and sulfur content for Crude delivered from reliable samples of laboratory of  Crude Oil flows. The quality data of Crude Oil must comply with the following criteria:\n\n  3.4 METHODOLOGY FOR CRUDE OIL VALUATION\n\n  42\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1\n\n   The basket of Crude Oil to be used shall always include a minimum of ten (10) Crude Oils. The basket of reference for Crude Oil with prices and  qualities historically recognized shall be used to determine the coefficients of adjustment for API grade and sulfur content. The price information  of the basket shall be continuously available from sources open to the public for each Crude Oil of reference. Prices reported used in the basket of  Crude Oil of reference shall be obtained from independent price information services recognized by the industry and shall come from real  Operations.     This basket provides a range of qualities to develop the coefficients for the regressions and therefore cover the flows that may be injected to the  Pipeline. The initial basket of Crude Oils to be used is the one established in table I of this procedure which may be reviewed by common  agreement between the Transporter and the Senders.\n\n   All price quotes of Crude Oil for a common location in the Coast of the Gulf of The United States of America shall be adjusted.     All prices of Crude Oil of reference shall be adjusted with respect to the location and based on the availability of price information according to the  following list:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Tables II to IV of this procedure show examples for calculation of basket Crude prices delivered in the Gulf Coast.\n\n   To determine API gravity and sulfur coefficients linear regressions shall be run using the minimum square method.\n\n\n\n  3.4.1 BASKET OF REFERENCE FOR CRUDE OIL\n\n  3.4.2 CALCULATION OF CRUDE OIL PRICES FOR THE BASKET IN THE COAST OF THE GULF\n\n  1. FOB quotation\n\n  - Transportation to the Coast of the Gulf of The United States of America is added using the appropriate vessel size.\n\n  - Customs Tariffs, Oil pollution Liability Insurance, \"Superfund\" taxes are included and others as appropriate.\n\n  2. CIF quotation\n\n  - Customs Tariffs, Oil pollution Liability Insurance, \"Superfund\" taxes are included and others as appropriate.\n\n  3. Crude Oil delivered by the Pipeline\n\n  - Any Pipeline fee is added if necessary\n\n  - \"Superfund\" is included and other fees/tariffs as appropriate.\n\n  3.4.3 LINEAR REGRESSION FOR PRICES, GRAVITY AND SULFUR\n\n  43\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    First the arithmetic average is calculated for prices of the basket of Crude Oils of reference delivered in the Gulf coast for three months. The  cumulative average for three months shall be calculated at the closing of the settling month using the prices for the settling month and the two (2)  previous months prior to the settling month (See 1 in table V).     To determine the API gravity coefficient, a linear regression analysis shall be performed using the three months average of Crude prices from the  basket calculated in the paragraph above as the dependent variable. Likewise, the API gravity and sulfur content is used for each Crude Oil of  reference as the independent variables. The formula to be used makes a regression of the price as a function of API gravity and sulfur  simultaneously (See 2 in table V).     To determine the sulfur content a linear regression analysis shall be conducted using the three month average of Crude prices from the basket  calculated in the previous paragraph as the dependent variable. Likewise, the API gravity and sulfur content is used for each Crude Oil of  reference as the independent variables. The formula to be used makes a regression of the price as a function of API gravity and sulfur  simultaneously (See 3 in table V).     The results of the determination of the linear relation between the price delivered and the API gravity and sulfur content may be stated in the  following lineal equation:     Y = A1* X1+ B* X2 + b     Pr = A1* APIR+ B*SR + b (1)     Where:     PR = Crude price in $/Bbl     A1 = API gravity coefficient determined through linear regression in $ by grade API-Bbl     APIR = Independent variable of API gravity     B = Sulfur coefficient determined through linear regression in $/%S-Bbl (negative number)     SR = Independent variable of sulfur content     b = Y interception determined from the linear regression in $/Bbl.\n\n   After obtaining the API and sulfur coefficients, a volumetric adjustment shall be calculated to conciliate differences between the quality of each  Sender and the mix transported. The quantity to be adjusted for each Sender is determined as is follows:\n\n\n\n  3.4.3 ADJSUTMENT OF VOLUMES FOR SENDERS (TABLE VI)\n\n  44\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    The relative value of Crude Oil for each Sender shall be calculated at the Point of Entrance. To obtain this, the API gravity of Crude from each  Sender is multiplied by the API coefficient obtained in the regression and then adding to this result, the multiplication of the sulfur percentage of  Crude from each Sender by the sulfur coefficient obtained in the regression. See table VI in the column - Relative value of Crude $/BBL     The relative value of the mix transported is calculated with the data of the relative value of each Crude Oil from all Senders. This value is obtained  calculating the weighted average of the relative values of each Crude Oil multiplied by the volume delivered by the Sender. (See (1) table VI     After this, the average export price of the mix must be obtained with the data from exports of all Senders in the month in which the adjustments are  made. (See (2) in table VI     To obtain the calculated price, the difference between the relative value of each Crude Oil and the relative value calculated for mix (1) must be  obtained, and add this difference to the average export price of the mix.     Then, the quantity delivered by the Sender is multiplied by its calculated price and this product is divided between the average export price of the  mix, obtaining as a result the total adjusted volume by Sender.     The volume to be adjusted shall be the difference between the total adjusted volume by Sender and the volume delivered by a Sender to the  Pipeline.     The sum of volumes to be adjusted from all Senders must be cero.     The Transporter shall run the linear regression using a spreadsheet such as Excel. The Transporter shall document the statistical results of the  linear regression so that the information can be provided to any Sender upon request.\n\n\n\n  45\n\n\n\n\n\n  Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1   Table I     Reference Crude Basket\n\n   Table II     Illegible Information     Table III     Illegible Information     Table IV     Illegible Information\n\n\n\nDegree Origin API, \u00b0 Sulfur% Source for   Pricing  BBL/MT\n\nArab Light Saudi Arabia 33.2 1.9 Argus, Formula 7.34  Arab Medium Saudi Arabia 30.5 2.4 Argus, Formula 7.22  Arab Heavy Saudi Arabia 27.6 2.8 Argus, Formula 7.09  Castilla Colombia 18.8 2.0 Platts 6.70  LLS US Gulf Coast 36.2 0.3 Argus 7.47  Mars US Gulf Coast 28.0 2.1 Argus 7.15  Maya Mexico 21.1 3.5 Argus 6.80  Napo Ecuador 18.0 2.3 Platts 6.66  East Ecuador 24.0 1.2 Platts 6.93  Vasconia Colombia 26.5 0.9 Platts 7.04\n\n  46\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    Table V     Linear regression of prices, API gravity and sulfur - August 2010 Closing Example\n\n\n\n   Table VI     Adjustments of volumes for senders - August 2010 example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  API Sulfur JUN-2010 JUL-2010 AUG-2010 Average of   3 previous   months (1)  Arab Light 33.2 1.9 77.60 76.26 76.29 76.72  Arab Medium 30.5 2.4 75.84 74.59 74.62 75.02  Arab Heavy 27.6 2.8 74.34 73.32 73.25 73.64  Castilla 18.8 2.0 69.84 69.20 69.20 69.41  LLS 36.2 0.3 78.94 78.84 79.79 79.19  Mars 28.9 2.1 74.63 74.18 74.35 74.39  Maya 21.1 3.5 66.27 67.47 68.65 67.46  Napo 18.0 2.3 69.56 69.02 69.08 69.22  East 24.0 1.2 72.12 71.93 72.15 72.07  Vasconia 26.5 0.9 74.93 75.89 75.29 75.37\n\n(2) API, $/API-BBL Coefficient 0,495      (3) Sulfur, $%S-BBL (1,191)\n\nBank of Quality Coefficients       API Coefficient (0.50)  Sulfur Coefficient (1.19)\n\nSender Volume   injected   by sender   MBBL/mo\n\nAPI in   the   injection   point\n\nSulfur in   the   injection   point\n\nRelative  value of   the crude   S$/BBL\n\nCalculated   Price   $/BBL\n\nTotal   Volume   adjusted   by sender   MBBL/mo\n\nVolume   to adjust   MBBL/mo\n\nSender A 900 31 0.5 14.75 77.97 935 36  Sender B 1,200 26 1.0 11.69 74.90 1,195 (2)  Sender C 600 20 2.0 7.53 70.74 566 (34)  Total 2,700         2,700 -\n\n(1) Relative value calculated for mix 11.79  (2) Average price of exportation of mix, August 2012 75.00\n\n  47\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    ANNEX 2: DEFINITION OF STANDARD BARRELS PER SYSTEM\n\n\n\n\n\n  48\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    ANNEX 3: DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEMS     See File Annex 3 attached.

If a client pays after the first Business day, the calculation for late interest shall be made from the due date of  the invoice     The charging of interests shall be made through a bill addressed to the client, which shall contain a Receivables statement on which interests are  calculated.\n\n\n\nECOPETROL MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES FOR RECEIVABLES SERVICES ECP-UTE-G-008\n\n3.10 Late Interests\n\n  16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   When an invoice or bill is not collected within the due dates or payment has been made partially, the collection action shall start immediately by  the Business Units providing the service and the Coordination of Receivables and collections.     The Coordination of Receivables and collections shall proceed to make effective the sources of payment and guarantees, in case of clients covered  by financial collateral who have not made full or partial payments of all their obligations represented in the sale invoices within the due dates in  accordance with the terms established in said invoices, with the support of their respective Business Unit and legal counsel.     For such purposes, the loss shall be reported to the insurance company (in case there is a policy covering the default), the documentation required  shall be presented before the banking entities (bank guarantees, bank acceptances or letters of credit), the client shall be contacted in the case of a  promissory note and in the case of guarantees, they shall be made effective before the corresponding entity in order to collect any overdue  amounts together with late interests.\n\n   If a client fails to make a payment within the normal process of collection and all instances have been used before going to court without any  positive results, in a peremptory term of 90 days, the Business Units providing the service must request to the respective legal advising Unit to  carry out collection actions pursuant to the provisions in the applicable regulations.     For such purpose, the respective Business must prepare and deliver the following documentation to the legal area:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   In the event that under special circumstances a client is late in meeting its obligations with ECOPETROL and does not have immediate payment  capacity, upon request, the Business Units providing the service may request to the Head of the Treasury Unit of ECOPETROL, attaching the  commercial and legal analysis of the client, an authorization for the extension of the term of the credit, and this financing shall not cause an  impairment of the guarantee in the force in favor of ECOPETROL.\n\n\n\nECOPETROL MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES FOR RECEIVABLES SERVICES ECP-UTE-G-008\n\n3.11 Collections Management\n\n3.11.1 Starting Legal Actions to Collect Overdue Balances\n\n  - A request memorandum indicating actions undertaken by the Business Unit providing the service and the Coordination of Receivables  and collections to obtain recovery of money owed.\n\n  - Documents supporting the credit in favor of ECOPETROL (invoices or promissory notes).\n\n  - Copies of all correspondence held with the client.\n\n  - Copy of the contract or certificate for the provision of services.\n\n3.11.2 Modifications in the Long Term.\n\n  17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Without prejudice of the foregoing, ECOPETROL reserves the right to request an acceptable guarantee that allows covering a higher risk for the  extension of the term for the payment. The interest rate for the refinancing term shall be in accordance with the conditions of the financial market.     Clients under legal proceedings to recover any amounts in favor of the company may be eligible for refinancing when lacking any property or  liquid guarantees executable in favor of ECOPETROL.     In the case of individual agreements, the interest rate for the refinancing period must be associated with the opportunity cost of ECOPETROL as  indicated by the Treasury Unit of the vice presidency of corporate finance. The amortization of the debt in default shall be applied first, to  sanctions and late interests, second, to current interests and third, to the principal. The mentioned option for refinancing if adopted by  ECOPETROL, must offer better expected results than those continuing under the legal proceeding or execution of guarantees.     Any refinancing must be subject to the approval of the Head of the Treasury Unit with the previous commercial, financial and legal analysis.\n\n   ECOPETROL may participate in payment agreements of clients with their creditors, under modalities aimed to ensure the maximum collection of  their Receivables in terms of present value as indicated hereunder:     Restructuring Agreement under Law 550 or reorganization agreements under Law 1116 of 2006 (company insolvency). Regarding the guarantees in  the proceedings to prevent bankruptcy, creditors still governed under Law 550/1999 (that is, territorial entities, decentralized entities and state  universities at the national or territorial level) have the power to inform the promoter within the following ten (10) days after starting the  negotiation, if the decision is only to make the guarantee effective without waving their right to obtain from the debtor the payment of the  obligation under default pursuant to the paragraph of article 14 of said Law. In those cases, ECOPETROL through the vice presidency of corporate  finance and the respective manager and/or director shall inform the Promoter if the guarantee will be made effective. Furthermore, Law 1116 of 2006  did not include the provision of the foregoing paragraph, instead, in article 43 the Law regulated the issue of real estate guarantees within the  process of insolvency, and therefore the power to make them effective was suspended, save by authorization of all creditors to wave said  limitation. Said decision shall be made with an absolute majority and included within the Agreement. Thus, the creditor may present in the  proceedings, together with its debt, the guarantee covering it and a request to make it effective, or else wait the development of the proceeding,  and if terminated by breaching, the enforceability will be then \"reactivated\".\n\n\n\nECOPETROL MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES FOR RECEIVABLES SERVICES ECP-UTE-G-008\n\n3.12 Restructuring by General Agreements.\n\n  18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Provision of services to clients with whom global payment agreements have been executed or under Law 550/99 or Law 1116/06 shall only be made  under the modality of payment in advance. Interests in favor of ECOPETROL derived from individual refinancing processes or restructurings  cannot be cancelled. Presently there are no regulations that allow the cancellation of interests by public entities such as ECOPETROL.     All refinancing shall be subject to approval by the respective manager and/or director with previous approval from the vice presidency of  corporate finance and after a commercial, financial and legal analysis; and evidence of economic support.\n\n   The calculation for the provision shall correspond to a technical evaluation (individual study based on the factors previously described) that will  allow to determine the contingency of loss or risk for non-collecting the right. Based on this the recording of an individual provision shall be made.     Accounting Provision: The Coordination of Receivables and collections together with the officers responsible for the management the Business  Units providing this service shall conduct an individual analysis of Receivables in default to determine which accounts are considered un- collectible, and based on that, make the recording of an individual provision. To do this, the manager and/or director of the Business Unit of  providing the service must submit a memorandum requesting the recording of the corresponding provision.     Fiscal Provision: For purposes of this provision, Receivables are classified by seniority and are calculated according to the percentages set out by  tax regulations. Any of the two methods indicated hereunder may be applied as a deduction for the provision:\n\n\n\n10 Defined according to the contingency of loss of the rights to be collected as a result of the degree of seniority, default, prescription, and  collection action through legal means; the provision includes the amount estimated as uncollectable.\n\n\n\nECOPETROL MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES FOR RECEIVABLES SERVICES ECP-UTE-G-008\n\n3.13 Provision for Accounts Receivable10\n\n  \u00b7 Individual: four debts between 12 and 24 months (33%), between 24 and 36 months (66%) and over 36 months (99%).    \u00b7 General: the corresponding percentages are applied depending on the seniority of their Receivables. (5% 3-6 months; 10% 6-12 months;  15% over 12 months).\n\n  19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Accounts Receivable classified as lost or uncollectible, and upon which all procedures for collection have been conducted and with a provision of  100% are subject to a request for a write-off pursuant to the provisions in the MAD.     Accounts Receivable classified as lost or uncollectible, whose value does not exceed 150 (SMLMV) (current monthly minimum legal wage) and  upon which all procedures for collection have been conducted and with a provision of 100% are subject to a request for a write-off by the  Coordinator of Records and Analysis of Accounts Payable if their value is between 1 and 70 monthly minimum legal wages, and by the Head of the  Unit of Accounting and Tax Information if their value is between 71 and 150 monthly minimum legal wages upon exhaustion of all legal and other  instances by the Business Unit generating it and the legal vice presidency. When Accounts Receivables classified as lost or uncollectible exceed  180 monthly minimum wages, its write off must be authorized by the Board of Directors upon exhaustion of instances such as: current collection,  execution of guarantees and previous legal collection.     It is understood as debt that is lost and without any value, all that debt whose collection is not possible to make it effective due to insolvency of  debtors and guarantors as a result of lack of property guarantees or by any other cause that allows them to be considered as currently lost  according to commercial practices. This definition includes those accounts receivable of less value whose collection procedures is significantly  more onerous than the write-off of said debt.

In those cases in which the contract has as a purpose any issues in connection with public order and the national  security, ECOPETROL shall forbid or limit this power to the insurance company.     ECOPETROL makes the commitment to carry out strict control on the development of the contract and the handling of the corresponding funds  and goods within the legal provisions that said control confers.\n\n   If there is any co-insurance as referred to in article 1095 of the code of commerce, the amount of the indemnity, as it may apply, shall be distributed  between the insurers at a pro rate of the amounts of their respective insurance, without solidarity between participating insurers and without  exceeding the amount insured under the insurance contract.\n\n\n\n  10.

Any failure to comply with this obligation would cause to ECOPETROL the consequences stipulated in  article 1078 of the code of commerce.\n\n   The time bar for the actions derived from the contract hereof shall be governed pursuant to article 1081 of the code of commerce as added or  amended or any other special applicable law to the case.\n\n   In case of any incongruity or differences between the general and particular conditions of the policy, the latter shall prevail.\n\n   In case of any disputes or conflicts in connection with the interpretation, execution and enforcement of the policy hereof, the parties shall make  their best effort to use the alternative settlement mechanisms as stated in Law 80 of 1993.\n\n   Without prejudice of any proceedings stipulations, for all purposes regarding the contract hereof, the parties establish as a domicile the city of  Bogota D C.\n\n\n\n  17.

The CEO Succession Committee and any other committee currently or in the future designated to review or oversee the selection process for the New CEO shall not take any material action prior to the March Board Meeting.\n\n(b) In order to ensure an orderly transition, Mr. Koffel may in his sole discretion continue (including, for the avoidance of doubt, after the 2014 Annual Meeting) as the Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board and a director of the Company during the selection process for the New CEO until the Board shall appoint the New CEO, which shall not be later than the earlier of December 31, 2014, or Mr. Koffel's voluntary resignation from such positions; provided that Mr. Koffel will resign as a director of the Company and the Chairman of the Board upon the effectiveness of the Board's appointment of the New CEO; provided, further, that nothing contained herein is intended to modify any employment agreement, equity award, retirement plan or other pre-existing obligation of the Company to Martin Koffel or to impose any additional obligations on Martin Koffel (beyond the obligation to resign as provided in this Section 4(b)). The Board shall appoint the New CEO as a director of the Company with a term expiring at the Company's next annual meeting after his or her appointment.\n\n5. Compensation Committee.

These four directors will be on URS' slate of directors nominated for election to the Board of Directors at the Company's 2014 Annual Meeting, along with eight incumbents, pursuant to an agreement with JANA Partners LLC. The four new directors will be: Diane C. Creel, William H. Schumann, III,\n\nDavid N. Siegel and V. Paul Unruh. Biographical information on the new directors is provided below.\n\nCurrent directors [A] and [B] have advised the Company that they do not plan to stand for re-election at the 2014\n\nAnnual Meeting. Therefore, from March 27, 2014 until the Annual Meeting, the Board will increase to fourteen members from the\n\ncurrent ten, but will be comprised of twelve directors following the 2014 Annual Meeting.\n\nUnder the agreement with JANA, URS will also form a Value Creation Committee of the Board that will evaluate all\n\noptions for enhancing shareholder value, including by engaging an investment bank to conduct a strategic review of the\n\nCompany's business segments, operations and capital structure, and reviewing the Company's management compensation structure to enhance alignment with shareholder value creation. The Committee will be comprised of four members, two of whom\n\nwill be new directors.\n\nMartin M. Koffel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of URS, stated: \"[A] and [B] are superb directors and have contributed much to our success, but each has decided for his own reasons not to stand for re-election. I and their fellow board\n\nmembers look forward to continuing to work with them until the Annual Meeting but will take this opportunity to express our\n\ngratitude for their service, sound counsel and friendship.\" Koffel continued: \"With [A]'s and [B]'s decisions to stand down and the expansion of our Board, we are adding four new, highly qualified independent directors to the Board on March 27 and we will nominate these directors for election at the\n\n2014 Annual Meeting. All are accomplished business leaders with experience\n\n\n\n\n\n  relevant to the URS enterprise, and we are confident that they will prove to be valuable additions as we continue working to build\n\nvalue for our stockholders.\" As previously disclosed, the URS Board has been engaged in succession planning for the Company's Chief Executive Officer position and has appointed a CEO Succession Committee comprised of independent directors. Two of the new directors\n\nwill promptly be appointed to this Committee. One of the new directors will also be appointed to the Compensation Committee.\n\nSaid Koffel, \"Having led URS for more than 25 years, I had previously communicated to the Board that it was important to have my successor in place in 2014, and our goal is to do just that. The Board has asked me to remain as Chairman and Chief\n\nExecutive Officer until a successor is named, which I expect to do unless circumstances change.\" Barry Rosenstein, Managing Partner of JANA Partners, said, \"We have appreciated our constructive dialogue with Martin Koffel and his team. We share their view that the Company is significantly undervalued, particularly given its strong cash\n\nflows and the valuable work Martin and his team have done over many years to ensure that URS is well-positioned to meet the\n\nneeds of its clients. I am confident that the addition of four highly-qualified directors and the formation of the Value Creation\n\nCommittee will help unlock this value for all shareholders.\" JANA Partners currently owns approximately 9.7 percent of the Company's common shares outstanding. URS' incumbent directors expected to be nominated for re\u00adelection at the 2014 Annual Meeting are: [C]; [D]; [E]; [F]; [G]; [H]; [I]; and [J].\n\nThe director nominations will be included in the Company's 2014 proxy statement and submitted for stockholder approval at the Company's 2014 Annual Meeting, [to be held on [date]]. The Company expects to file its proxy materials for the\n\n2014 Annual Meeting [in the near future] and encourages stockholders to review the proxy materials when they become available.\n\nThe agreement between URS and JANA Partners will be filed on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange\n\nCommission. The agreement includes certain standstill restrictions that will be in effect until 30 days prior to the deadline by which\n\na shareholder must give notice to the Company of its intention to nominate a director at or bring other business before the 2015\n\nAnnual Meeting. JANA Partners has committed to\n\n\n\n\n\n  vote the shares that it controls in support of URS' twelve director nominees at the Company's 2014 Annual Meeting.

If the Village Media Company elects proceed under the business plan, then creation of such PFHOF Work shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Village Media Company shall pay to PFHOF a License Fee in accordance with this Agreement for the license to create the PFHOF Work. If the Village Media Company does not make such an election, then PFHOF shall have the right to create such PFHOF Work itself. 2.9 PFHOF agrees that during the Term, except with respect to the categories identified on Exhibit A, if PFHOF desires to either exploit itself or license a third party to exploit an existing PFHOF Work, it shall first give the Village Media Company a right of first offer to exclusively license such PFHOF Work, subject to any Rights Restrictions. In such a case, PFHOF shall promptly notify the Village Media Company and provide the Village Media Company with any bona fide third party offer to license such PFHOF Work that PFHOF is willing to accept, including any specific terms and proposed business plan relating to such offer.

ARTICLE 1. EXERCISE. 1.1 Method of Exercise. Payment. (a) Cash Exercise. The purchase rights represented by this Warrant may be exercised by the Holder, in whole or in part, by the surrender of this Warrant (with the notice of exercise form attached hereto as Appendix 1 duly executed) at the principal office of the Company, and by the payment to the Company, by certified, cashier's or other check acceptable to the Company or by wire transfer to an account designated by the Company, of an amount equal to the aggregate Exercise Price of the Shares being purchased.\n\n\n\n\n\n10 (b) Net Issue Exercise. In lieu of exercising this Warrant, the Holder may elect to receive Shares equal to the value of this Warrant (or the portion thereof being canceled) by surrender of this Warrant at the principal office of the Company together with notice of such election, in which event the Company shall issue to the Holder a number of Warrant Shares computed using the following formula: Y (A-B) X = \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 A Where: X = the number of Shares to be issued to the Holder. Y = the number of the Shares being exercised on the date of determination. A = the fair market value of one Share on the date of determination. B = the per share Exercise Price (as adjusted to the date of such calculation). (c) Fair Market Value. For purposes of this Article 1, the per share fair market value of the Warrant Shares shall mean:\n\n\n\n\n\n11 (i) If the Company's Common Stock is publicly traded, the per share fair market value of the Warrant Shares shall be the average of the closing prices of the Common Stock as quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, or the principal exchange on which the Common Stock is listed, in each case for the fifteen trading days ending five trading days prior to the date of determination of fair market value; (ii) If the Company's Common Stock is not so publicly traded, the per share fair market value of the Warrant Shares shall be such fair market value as is determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company after taking into consideration factors it deems appropriate, including, without limitation, recent sale and offer prices of the capital stock of the Company in private transactions negotiated at arm's length. 1.2 Delivery of Certificate and New Warrant. Promptly after Holder first exercises this Warrant, the Company shall deliver to Holder certificates for or other evidence (reasonably acceptable to the Holder) of the Shares received and, if this Warrant has not been fully exercised and has not expired, a new Warrant representing the Shares not so received. 1.3 Replacement of Warrants. On receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, on delivery of an indemnity agreement reasonably satisfactory in form and amount to the Company or, in the case of mutilation, on surrender and cancellation of this Warrant, the Company shall execute and deliver, in lieu of this Warrant, a new warrant of like tenor. ARTICLE 2. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE SHARES. 2.1 Stock Dividends, Splits, Combinations, Etc. If the Company declares or pays a dividend on the Shares payable in Common Stock, or other securities, then upon exercise of this Warrant, for each Share acquired, Holder shall receive, without cost to Holder, the total number and kind of securities to which Holder would have been entitled had Holder owned the Shares of record as of the date the dividend occurred. If the Company subdivides the Shares by reclassification or otherwise into a greater number of shares or takes any other action which increases the amount of stock into which the Shares are convertible, the number of shares purchasable hereunder shall be proportionately increased and the Exercise Price shall remain the same. If the outstanding shares of the Company are combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares, the Exercise Price shall be proportionately increased and the number of Shares shall be proportionately decreased. 2.2 Reclassification, Exchange or Substitution, Etc. Upon any reclassification, exchange, substitution, or other event that results in a change of the number and/or class of the securities issuable upon exercise or net exercise of this Warrant, Holder shall be entitled to receive, upon exercise or net exercise of this Warrant, the number and kind of securities and property that Holder would have received for the Shares if this Warrant had been exercised immediately before such reclassification, exchange, substitution, or other event. The Company or its successor shall promptly issue to Holder an amendment to this Warrant setting forth the number and kind of such new securities or other property issuable upon exercise or net exercise of this Warrant as a result of such reclassification, exchange, substitution or other event that results in a change of the number and/or class of securities issuable upon exercise or net exercise of this Warrant.\n\n\n\n\n\n12 2.3 Merger or Consolidation. Upon any capital reorganization of the Company's capital stock (other than a subdivision, combination, reclassification or exchange of shares provided for elsewhere in this Section 2) or a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another corporation, then as a part of such reorganization, merger or consolidation, provision shall be made so that the Holder shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon the exercise of this Warrant, the number and kind of securities and property of the Company, or of the successor corporation resulting from such reorganization, merger or consolidation, to which that Holder would have received for the Shares if this Warrant had been exercised immediately before such reorganization, merger or consolidation. 2.4 Fractional Shares. No fractional Shares shall be issuable upon exercise or net exercise of this Warrant and the number of Shares to be issued shall be rounded up to the nearest whole Share. ARTICLE 3.

Price, Shipment and Payment 4.1. Price. The price that Sekisui shall pay for the Products shall be established separately for the Reagent Kits and for the products other than Reagent Kits. The price that Sekisui shall pay for the Reagent Kits Products shall be based upon a formula intended to ensure that Sekisui will receive 90% of the total Available Margin for all Products during the first 12 months of this Agreement, 70% of the total Available Margin for all Products during months 13-24 of this Agreement, and 65% of the total Available Margin for all Products thereafter.

If the parties do not mutually agree to the terms of such potential acquisition within the Negotiation Period then the Exclusivity Period shall end and, subject to Sekisui's Right of First Refusal, Qualigen shall be free to negotiate the terms of a Sale Transaction with any Third Party. 9.3. Right of First Refusal. During the Term, Sekisui shall have a right of first refusal to match the terms of any arms length, bona fide proposed Sale Transaction with a Third Party (\"Sekisui's Right of First Refusal\"). Qualigen shall provide Sekisui with at least 30 days prior written notice and access to all due diligence materials provided to any potential acquirer, such 30 day period to commence upon the notification to Sekisui that Qualigen's board of directors has approved such Proposed Sale Transaction (as set forth in a term sheet or draft definitive agreement provided to Sekisui), subject to Sekisui's Right of First Refusal. At any time during such 30 day period, Sekisui may elect to match the terms of such proposal. Sekisui will be credited in any such proposal by the cumulative amount of all Financing Payments made to date. For example, if a Third Party offers to acquire Qualigen for $50,000,000 and Sekisui has funded the full $6,200,000 of Financing Payments, Sekisui's Right of First Refusal to match the proposed transaction would be a price of $43,800,000. In the event that Sekisui elects not to move forward with such proposal for a Sale Transaction, Qualigen shall have a period of 120 days to consummate a Sale Transaction on the same terms as provided to Sekisui. If a Sale Transaction has not been consummated within such 120 days period, any Sale Transaction must once again comply with the provisions of this Section 9.3. 13\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4. Penalty for Breach. In the event of any breach of Sections 9.1 through 9.3, including without limitation, any actions by stockholders of Qualigen that result in a Sale Transaction without complying with Sections 9.1 through 9.3 above, or otherwise hinder the intent and purpose of the provisions of Sections 9.1 through 9.3 above, in addition to any other remedies available to Sekisui under the terms of this Agreement, including the right to specific performance and other equitable remedies, Sekisui shall be entitled to liquidated damages in the amount of three times any and all Financing Payments made to date. For the avoidance of doubt, this clause does not apply to a failure of the stockholders of Qualigen to approve a Sale Transaction proposed by Sekisui, so long as such stockholders did not approve a Sale Transaction on the same terms with a Third Party during the Term. 9.5. Molecular Clinical Diagnostics. In furtherance of the foregoing, during the Exclusivity Period, Qualigen shall, in consultation with Sekisui, take commercially reasonable steps to seek to regain any rights in any Qualigen molecular clinical diagnostic product technology that Qualigen has previously granted to Gen-Probe, Hologic, or any of their affiliates. 10. Representations and Warranties 10.1. By Qualigen. Qualigen hereby represents, warrants and covenants that: (a) Qualigen has the full right, power and corporate authority to enter into this Agreement, and to make the promises set forth in this Agreement, and to grant the rights herein, and that there are no outstanding agreements, assignments or encumbrances in existence inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement and that this Agreement is enforceable against Qualigen.

(c) As of the Effective Date, Qualigen has not been notified with respect to, and to Qualigen's best knowledge there is no patent infringement action pending before any court or governmental agency or other tribunal relating to any Product. (d) As of the Effective Date, Qualigen has not been notified with respect to, and to Qualigen's best knowledge no material actions are pending before any court or governmental agency or other tribunal relating to any Product. (e) All Product delivered to Sekisui or Sekisui's customers pursuant to this Agreement, at the time of such delivery, shall not be adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of any applicable law, regulation or guideline effective at the time of delivery and shall not be an article which may not be introduced into interstate commerce under any applicable law, regulation or guideline. 14\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) The manufacturing facilities and processes utilized for the manufacture of each Product shall comply with applicable FDA regulations including, without limitation, applicable current Good Manufacturing Practices as described in 21 CFR 820. Qualigen does not represent, warrant or covenant that the Development Plan will be successfully accomplished, that the Development Plan will produce any particular results or any favorable results, that the Development Plan will result in any Development IP (or in any valuable Development IP), that the Products (if any) arising from the Development Plan can ever receive Regulatory Approvals or be successfully or profitably commercialized, or that any other current or future Products can be successfully or profitably commercialized by Sekisui. Moreover, Sekisui acknowledges and accepts the risks inherent in attempting to develop and commercialize any medical product. There is no implied representation that any Products can be successfully developed or commercialized. Qualigen shall provide to Sekisui and for the benefit of Sekisui's customers of Products a standard commercial written warranty that the Products will be free of defects in materials or workmanship starting from the date the Product has been received by Sekisui's customer and ending after the length of time stated for the applicable Product on Exhibit D hereto (the \"User Warranty\"). The User Warranty is contingent upon proper use of a Product in the application for which such Product was intended and does not cover Products that were altered or modified (or added to or subtracted from), that were used after the expiration date thereon or that were subjected by the carrier, distributor or the customer to abuse, mishandling or unusual physical, thermal, chemical or electrical stress. 10.2. By Sekisui. Sekisui represents, warrants and covenants that: (a) Sekisui has the full right, power and corporate authority to enter into this Agreement and to make the promises set forth in this Agreement and that there are no outstanding agreements, assignments or encumbrances in existence inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement and that this Agreement is enforceable against Sekisui. (b) As of the Effective Date, Sekisui has not been notified in writing with respect to, nor is there, to Sekisui's best knowledge, any patent infringement action pending before any court or governmental agency or other tribunal relating to Sekisui's sale or distribution of the Products. (c) As of the Effective Date, Sekisui has not been notified in writing with respect to, nor is there, to Sekisui's best knowledge, any action pending preventing Sekisui from selling and distributing the Products in the Territory. (d) Sekisui shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain before distribution of each Product, all licenses, registrations and permits required to enable Sekisui to act as a distributor of such Product in the Territory. (e) Sekisui shall not make, or advise its customers to make, any alterations or modifications to, or any additions to or subtractions from, any Product. (f) Sekisui shall make no attempt to reverse-engineer any Product nor encourage or assist anyone else to do so. 15\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n10.3. No Implied Warranties. The express warranties set forth in this Section 10 and elsewhere in this Agreement are provided in lieu of, and EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS, all other warranties, express and implied, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY OTHER WARRANTY, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, TO THE OTHER PARTY WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCTS OR THE OTHER SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT. THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY EXCLUDE ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR OF MERCHANTABILITY. Each Party's representations, warranties and/or covenants under this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other Party and may be asserted only by the other Party and not by anyone else (including without limitation any customer of the other Party; provide, however, that end user customers may assert the User Warranty against Qualigen). 11. Indemnities 11.1. Indemnification by Sekisui. Sekisui shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Qualigen, and its directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (collectively, the \"Qualigen Indemnitees\") from and against any and all claims, suits and proceedings by a Third Party (individually and collectively, \"Claims\"), and any and all losses, obligations, damages, deficiencies, costs, penalties, liabilities, assessments, judgments, amounts paid in settlement, fines and expenses (including court costs and reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys), incurred in the investigation, defense and/or settlement of any Claims (individually and collectively, \"Losses\"; it being expressly understood, however, that incidental, special, indirect and consequential damages and lost profits, lost savings and interruptions of business are expressly excluded therefrom and from such defined term): (a) arising out of the negligence or willful misconduct of Sekisui or its directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives in the performance of Sekisui's obligations under this Agreement; or (b) arising out of or in connection with a breach or violation by Sekisui or its subdistributor of any applicable law or a material breach by Sekisui of any of its obligations under this Agreement, including any representations or warranties set forth herein; provided, however, that Sekisui shall have no liability or obligation to any Qualigen Indemnitee for any Claims or Losses to the extent that such Claims or Losses are primarily caused by a Qualigen Indemnitee's breach of applicable law, breach of this Agreement, negligence or willful misconduct. 11.2. Indemnification by Qualigen. Qualigen shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sekisui and its directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (collectively, the \"Sekisui Indemnitees\") from and against any and all Losses incurred in the investigation, defense and/ or settlement of any Claims: (a) related to bodily injury, death or property damage directly caused by any Product which has not been altered or modified (or added to or subtracted from) in any way, has been handled, stored, transported and used in accordance with Qualigen's guidelines and has not been used after its expiration date or subjected to abuse, mishandling or unusual physical, thermal, chemical or electrical stress; (b) arising out of the negligence or willful misconduct of Qualigen or its directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives; (c) arising out of a breach or violation by Qualigen of any applicable law or a material breach by Qualigen of any of its obligations under this Agreement, including any representations or warranties set forth herein; or (d) arising out of any claim that any of the manufacture, marketing, import, offer for sale, sale, or use of any Product infringes upon any patent, proprietary, or intellectual property right of any Third Party in the Territory; provided, however, that Qualigen shall have no liability or obligation to any Sekisui Indemnitee for any Claims or Losses to the extent that such Claims or Losses are primarily caused by a Sekisui Indemnitee's (or any other entity or person within the Sekisui corporate family's) breach of applicable law, breach of this Agreement, negligence or willful misconduct. 16\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3. Patent Indemnity. Qualigen and Sekisui shall notify each other promptly in writing of any action (and all prior claims relating to such action) brought against Qualigen or Sekisui alleging that the manufacture, marketing, import, offer for sale, sale or use of a Product constitute infringement of the intellectual property rights of a Third Party, and (provided that such a Claim does not arise from Sekisui's noncompliance with Sections 3.6, 8.4, 10.2(b), 10.2(c), 10.2(e) or 10.2(f) of this Agreement (e.g., Sekisui has altered a Product or has used a Sekisui trademark in connection with a Product)) Qualigen agrees to defend Sekisui in such action at its expense and shall pay any costs or damages finally awarded against Sekisui in any such action; provided, that Qualigen shall have had sole control of the defense of any such action and all negotiations for its settlement or compromise and provided further that no settlement or compromise shall be binding on a Party hereto without its prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event a lawsuit is filed against Sekisui or Qualigen alleging that the manufacture, marketing, import, offer for sale, sale or use of a Product constitute infringement of the intellectual property rights of a Third Party, or Qualigen files an action for declaratory judgment because of a serious threat of such a lawsuit, or if in Qualigen's reasonable business judgment a Product is likely to become the subject of a claim of infringement of a patent or other intellectual property right; then Qualigen may, at its expense, and may request Sekisui's assistance to, attempt to obtain a license to such patent or other intellectual property right. 11.4. Indemnification Procedures. The Party or other Indemnitee intending to claim indemnification under this Section 11 (an \"Indemnified Party\") shall promptly notify the other Party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") of any Claim in respect of which the Indemnified Party intends to claim such indemnification (provided, that no delay or deficiency on the part of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability or obligation under this Agreement except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has suffered actual prejudice directly caused by the delay or other deficiency), and the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof (with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party) whether or not such Claim is rightfully brought; provided, however, that an Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel and participate in the defense thereof, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the Indemnified Party, unless the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense or unless a representation of both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to the actual or potential differing interests between them, in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be required to pay for more than one separate counsel no matter the number or circumstances of all Indemnified Parties. If the Indemnifying Party shall fail to timely assume the defense of and reasonably defend such Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain or assume control of such defense and the Indemnifying Party shall pay (as incurred and on demand) the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party and all other expenses of investigation and litigation. The Indemnified Party, and its directors, officers, advisers, agents and employees, shall cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party and its legal representatives in the investigations of any Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for the indemnification of any Claim settled (or resolved by consent to the entry of judgment) without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party. Also, if the Indemnifying Party shall control the defense of any such Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to settle such Claim; provided, that the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the Indemnified Party before entering into any settlement of (or resolving by consent to the entry of judgment upon) such Claim unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of any person or entity by an Indemnified Party, no requirement that the Indemnified Party admit fault or culpability, and no adverse effect on any other claims that may be made by or against the Indemnified Party and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and such settlement does not require the Indemnified Party to take (or refrain from taking) any action. 17\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nRegardless of who controls the defense, the other Party hereto shall reasonably cooperate in the defense as may be requested. Without limitation, the Party hereto which is not the Indemnifying Party and (if different) the Indemnified Party, and their respective directors, officers, advisers, agents and employees, shall cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party and its legal representatives in the investigation and defense of any Claim. 11.5. Expenses of Enforcement. As the Parties intend complete indemnification, all costs and expenses of enforcing any provision of this Section 11 shall also be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party except as otherwise set forth in Section 11.4. 11.6. Insurance. Qualigen, at its own expense, shall procure and maintain during the Term, insurance policies with the minimum coverages set forth below (\"Insurance\"). Sekisui shall be named as an additional insured with respect to the Insurance. The Insurance shall be primary for all purposes to other insurance coverage, whether such other insurance is stated to be primary, contributory, excess, contingent or otherwise, without recourse to or contribution from any Sekisui-owned coverage. (a) Commercial General Liability Insurance - Combined single limit for bodily and property damage of not less than $1,000,000 for each occurrence and $2,000,000 annual aggregate providing: \u25cf Assault and Battery coverage, \u25cf Broad form property damage coverage, \u25cf Broad form contractual liability coverage, \u25cf Products and completed operations coverage, and \u25cf Personal and advertising injury coverage. (b) Workers' Compensation and Employer's Liability Insurance - With limits of liability for: \u25cf Workers' compensation as required by statute; \u25cf Employer's liability for bodily injury by accident: $500,000 each accident; bodily injury by disease: $500,000 policy limit; and bodily injury by disease: $500,000 each employee. All Qualigen's Insurance shall be placed with an insurer that (a) has an A.M. Best rating of A- or better or (b) is a qualified self- insurance program that is approved by Sekisui. Qualigen shall provide Sekisui, upon request, with written evidence of the Insurance, including where it is provided through qualified self-insurance. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to limit Qualigen's responsibility to the amounts stated above or to any limits of Qualigen's insurance policies. 12. Regulatory Matters 12.1. Regulatory Approval. Qualigen shall be responsible for maintaining, at its sole cost, the Regulatory Approvals required for the marketing and sale of the Products in the Applicable Markets. Qualigen shall hold in its name all Regulatory Approvals required for the marketing and sale of the Products in a country or region and shall (to the extent commercially reasonable to do so) maintain in good standing all existing Regulatory Approvals. Qualigen and Sekisui shall provide reasonable advice and assistance to each other as may be necessary to maintain required Regulatory Approvals. In addition, Qualigen shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain Regulatory Approval for any additional territories upon Sekisui's commercially reasonable request. 18\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n12.2. Distribution Approvals. Sekisui shall be responsible for seeking, obtaining and maintaining (i) all licenses, registrations and permits (excluding patents) required to be obtained by Sekisui to enable Sekisui to act as a distributor of the Product pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) all approvals from the Regulatory Authorities regarding marketing and advertising materials to be used by Sekisui to promote the Product. Qualigen shall cooperate with Sekisui in making and maintaining all filings that may be necessary or desirable in connection with obtaining and maintaining any regulatory approvals necessary for Sekisui to act as a distributor of the Product in the Applicable Markets. 12.3. Communication With Agencies. In the Applicable Markets, Qualigen shall have responsibility for communications with the Regulatory Authorities concerning any required Regulatory Approvals, approval of Product related marketing and advertising materials, and Product quality matters. 12.4. Governmental Warnings. Each Party shall advise the other Party promptly (but in any event within no more than 48 hours) of any warning (including any FDA Form 483), citation, indictment, claim, lawsuit, or proceeding issued or instituted by any federal, state or local governmental entity or agency against the Party, or of any revocation of any license or permit if, and only to the extent that, the manufacture, storage, or handling of the Product, or the marketing, selling, promotion or distribution of the Product, is affected. 12.5. Adverse Events, Recalls and Field Corrections. Qualigen shall have responsibility to determine whether any Adverse Events, Recalls or Field Corrections information must be reported to the FDA (under United States law) or any other Regulatory Authorities and Qualigen shall have responsibility to prepare and submit notification of Adverse Events, Recalls and/or Field Corrections to respective Regulatory Authorities for the Products. Qualigen shall provide prompt notice to Sekisui of any Adverse Events, Recalls or Field Corrections, which notice shall in any event be delivered within no more than 3 business days from Qualigen learning of such occurrence. 12.6. Complaints. Qualigen shall receive, investigate in a timely manner, and as appropriate, resolve customer complaints in the Territory. If an investigation is needed in response to a complaint or inquiry related to the Product, Qualigen shall perform the investigation and shall bear the cost of such investigation. The documentation of such investigation shall include, but not be limited to, investigation results, cause analysis, corrective and preventative action and health hazard/medical assessment, as appropriate. In the event a Product is returned by a customer for investigation, Qualigen shall ship a replacement Product to the customer. (Provided, that if a request for a return of Product is due to a change of mind over using the Product or the Sekisui customer has overstocked the product, rather than due to a warranty issue, Qualigen need not accept the return or provide any replacement or substitute.) Qualigen shall retain records of all Product related complaints, or Adverse Events for a period of not less than five (5) years beyond the expiration date of the Product or for such longer period as may be required by applicable law. Qualigen shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all complaints are appropriately closed within 90 days or less from the receipt of such complaint. 19\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n12.7. Product Recalls. In the event that (i) any Applicable Market governmental agency or authority issues a request or directive or orders that the Products be recalled or retrieved, (ii) an Applicable Market court of competent jurisdiction orders that the Products be recalled or retrieved, or (iii) Qualigen and Sekisui reasonably determine, after mutual consultation, that the Products should be recalled, corrected or retrieved in any particular country or countries, Qualigen and/or Sekisui shall conduct such activity and the parties shall take all appropriate corrective actions and shall execute the steps detailed in the recall strategy. Qualigen shall be responsible for the content of any communication to the customers regarding any Recall or Field Correction. In the event such action results from Sekisui's gross negligence or willful misconduct, Sekisui shall be responsible for the expenses thereof. Otherwise, Qualigen shall be responsible for the expenses of the action. Sekisui and Qualigen shall cooperate fully with one another in conducting any such action. Sekisui shall destroy units of Products lawfully recalled only upon Qualigen's (or any governmental authority's) written instruction to destroy such units of Products, and only then in accordance with Qualigen's procedures and instructions. Otherwise, Sekisui shall return the recalled units of Product to Qualigen in accordance with Qualigen's procedures and instructions after completion of the action. 12.8. European Union Vigilance and Canada Mandatory Problem Reporting. In the event that Qualigen receives any Potentially Serious Complaints regarding the Products from a customer located in the European Union or Canada, then Qualigen shall notify Sekisui promptly, but in any event within no more than (3) business days. If Qualigen receives a complaint from any Competent Authority or Health Canada with regard to the Products, Qualigen shall notify Sekisui promptly, but in any event within no more than 48 hours. Qualigen shall have the responsibility to correspond with the Competent Authority or Health Canada, as the Authorized Representative or Regulatory Correspondent, regarding any such complaints. If corrective actions are required, the cost of the corrective action shall be borne by Qualigen up to the extent such complaint is related to the manufacturing of the Products by Qualigen, or some other cause or event attributable to Qualigen, and shall be borne by Sekisui up to the extent such complaint is due to some other cause or event attributable to Sekisui. 20\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n13. Confidential Information; Audit Rights 13.1. Confidentiality Obligation. It is contemplated that in the course of the performance of this Agreement each Party may, from time to time, disclose proprietary and confidential information to the other (\"Confidential Information\"). Except to the extent expressly authorized by this Agreement or otherwise agreed to in writing, during the Term and for a period of five (5) years following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, the receiving Party shall disclose the other Party's Confidential Information only to its own (or its Affiliates') officers, employees, consultants, Third Party service providers, attorneys, accountants, agents, bankers, lenders, prospective lenders and prospective equity investors, and in each case only if and to the extent necessary to carry out their respective responsibilities under this Agreement or in accordance with the exercise of their rights under this Agreement or in accordance with customary permitted practice (such as to seek or maintain financing or credit), and such disclosure shall be limited to the maximum extent possible consistent with such responsibilities and rights. Except as set forth in the foregoing sentence, neither Party shall disclose Confidential Information of the other to any Third Party without the other's prior written consent. In all events, however, any and all disclosure to a Third Party (or to any such Affiliate) shall be pursuant to the terms of a non-disclosure/nonuse agreement no less restrictive than this Section 13 (or, in the case of attorneys, to a duty and obligation of nondisclosure/nonuse pursuant to the applicable rules of the profession). The Party which disclosed Confidential Information of the other to any Third Party (or to any such Affiliate) shall be responsible and liable for any disclosure or use by such Third Party or Affiliate (or its disclosees) which would have violated this Agreement if committed by the Party itself. Neither Party shall use Confidential Information of the other except as expressly allowed by and for the purposes of this Agreement or in accordance with the exercise of their rights under this Agreement or in accordance with customary permitted practice (such as to seek or maintain financing or credit) or and, after the Term, by Qualigen only to the extent required to continue to offer and provide goods and services to former Sekisui customers of Products. Each Party shall take such action to preserve the confidentiality of each other's Confidential Information as it would customarily take to preserve the confidentiality of its own Confidential Information (but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care). Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, each Party, upon the other's request, promptly shall return or destroy all the Confidential Information disclosed to the other Party pursuant to this Agreement, including all copies, reflections, analyses and extracts of documents, except for one archival copy (and such electronic copies that exist as part of the Party's computer systems, network storage systems and electronic backup systems) of such materials solely to be able to monitor its obligations that survive under this Agreement. The non-use and non-disclosure obligations set forth in this Section 13 shall not apply to any Confidential Information, or portion thereof, that the receiving Party can demonstrate: (a) is at the time of disclosure in the public domain; 21\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) after disclosure, becomes part of the public domain, by publication or otherwise, through no fault of and or without violation of any duty of confidentiality of the receiving Party or its disclosees; (c) at the time of disclosure is already in the receiving Party's possession with no duty of confidentiality, and such prior possession can be demonstrated by the receiving Party by written proof (provided that this subsection shall not apply to Confidential Information exchanged between the Parties before the execution of this Agreement that was subject to a confidentiality obligation at the time of such disclosure); (d) is rightfully received by the receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from an independent Third Party without obligation of confidentiality; provided, however, that to the receiving Party's best knowledge, such information was not obtained by said Third Party, directly or indirectly, from the disclosing Party; or (e) is independently developed by or expressly for the receiving Party, in either case solely by personnel without any access to or use of the disclosing Party's Confidential Information, as shown by receiving Party's contemporaneous written records. In the event either Party must disclose the other Party's Confidential Information in order to comply with applicable governmental regulations or as otherwise required by law or judicial process, such Party shall give reasonable advance notice to the other Party of such proposed disclosure in order that the non-disclosing Party may intercede and oppose such process, and shall use its best efforts to secure a protective order or confidential-treatment order preventing or limiting (to the greatest possible extent and for the longest possible period) the disclosure and/or requiring that the Confidential Information so disclosed be used only for the purposes for which the law or regulation required, or for which the order was issued. The Parties acknowledge that the defined term \"Confidential Information\" shall include not only a disclosing Party's own Confidential Information but also Confidential Information of an Affiliate or of a Third Party which is in the possession of a disclosing Party. However, both Parties agree not to disclose to the other Party any Confidential Information of a Third Party which is in the possession of such Party, unless the other Party has given an express prior written consent (which specifies the owner of such Confidential Information) to receive such particular Confidential Information. 22\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other agreement between Sekisui and Qualigen, nothing in this Agreement or any other agreement between the Parties prohibits, or is intended in any manner to prohibit, either Sekisui or Qualigen from reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity, including but not limited to the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Congress, and any agency Inspector General, or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal law or regulation. Sekisui and Qualigen do not need the prior authorization of anyone at the other Party or the other Party's legal counsel to make any such reports or disclosures and they are not required to notify the other Party that it has made such reports or disclosures. 13.2. Use of Names. During the Term, Sekisui is hereby permitted to use the Qualigen name and any Qualigen content (including the content of any existing sales collateral and marketing materials) in any sales collateral, marketing materials or other communications used in connection with the marketing and sales of the Product with the prior written consent of Qualigen, which consent shall not be reasonably withheld or delayed. Other than as provided in the foregoing sentence or to the extent such use is based on a public disclosure previously made by the other Party, during the Term neither Qualigen nor Sekisui shall use the name of the other in any verbal or written communications with any Third Party, except as allowed or contemplated herein, without the prior written consent of the other Party. 13.3. Press Releases. Neither Party shall make any press release or other similar public announcement concerning this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event such disclosure or public announcement is required to be made on a more immediate basis to comply with applicable laws, then approval will be deemed granted if no response is received from the non-disclosing Party within the time frames required by law; provided, however, that the disclosing Party provides the non-disclosing Party with notice of the legally required time frame for the approval of the disclosure. Neither Party shall use the trademark or logo of the other Party, its Affiliates or their respective employee(s) in any publicity, promotion, news release or public disclosure relating to this Agreement or its subject matter, except as may be required by law or except with the prior express written permission of such other Party, such permission not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, or except in Sekisui's advertisement, promotion and sale of the Products in compliance with this Agreement in the ordinary course of business. Notwithstanding the above, once a public disclosure has been made, either Party shall be free to disclose to Third Parties any information contained in said public disclosure, without further pre-review or pre-approval. 13.4. Audit Rights. Each Party shall keep accurate books and records in sufficient detail to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations and this Agreement and enable the other Party to determine the correctness of any report made under this Agreement and monitor compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations and this Agreement through the process below.

Either Party may terminate this Agreement (i) immediately upon written notice in the event of the closing of a Sale Transaction; or (ii) immediately upon written notice if the other files a voluntary bankruptcy petition or makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors or becomes subject to any order for relief or involuntary bankruptcy petition under any bankruptcy, liquidation, insolvency or similar law which is not dismissed within 60 days. 14.2. Termination by Qualigen. Qualigen may terminate this Agreement (i) upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in the event of any failure of Sekisui to make a Financing Payment that is determined to be due, which failure is not cured within such 30 day period, or (ii) upon sixty (60) days prior written notice in the event of any material breach of the diligence obligations (which is understood not to include failing to meet forecasts for sales to customers) set forth in the Business Plan (as it may be amended by the Parties from time to time), which breach is not cured within such 60 day period. 14.3. Termination by Sekisui. Sekisui may terminate this Agreement upon prior written notice (i) in the event of any failure of Qualigen to meet a milestone set forth in the Development Plan (as it may be amended by the Parties from time to time), or (ii) at any other time upon ninety (90) days' prior written notice of impending termination. 14.4. Effect of Termination. Sections 4.6, 5.5, 8.1, 8.2, 11.1-11.4, 13, 14.4 and 15 shall survive the later of the expiration or termination of the Term. In addition, all provisions that survive termination, that are irrevocable or that arise due to termination shall survive in accordance with their terms. Any other provisions of this Agreement contemplated by their terms to pertain to a period of time following termination or expiration of this Agreement shall survive only for the specified period of time. Upon the expiration or termination of the Term, (i) Sekisui shall cooperate in permitting Qualigen to offer to rehire any Sekisui sales representatives who are primarily responsible for selling the Products as set forth in Section 4.6, (ii) Sekisui shall transfer to Qualigen the ownership of any Sekisui Instruments (subject to reimbursement from Qualigen for the book value (original cost less depreciation) of such Sekisui Instruments), (iii) Qualigen shall reimburse Sekisui for a prorated portion of all prepaid distribution fees paid by Sekisui during the final year of this Agreement to subdistributors, (iv) Sekisui shall assign to Qualigen each subdistributor agreement which Qualigen requests be assigned to Qualigen, and (v) each Party shall remain liable for its obligations accrued before the effective date of such expiration or termination (and for avoidance of doubt: upon expiration or termination Sekisui shall remain liable to pay Qualigen all Financing Payments then due under the Development Plan based upon the milestones that Qualigen has completed by the date of such expiration or termination). In the event there are unfulfilled orders for Products outstanding as of termination of this Agreement, Sekisui may, at its option, cancel such orders upon notice to Qualigen (in which case Qualigen agrees to fill such orders to Sekisui's end customers directly unless such customer chooses to cancel such order) or cause Qualigen to fulfill such orders and invoice Sekisui for amounts owed with respect thereto. If either Party is aware of an impending expiration or termination of the Term, it shall conduct its business with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement in the ordinary course (and not otherwise than in the ordinary course) for the duration of the Term. 24\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n15. Miscellaneous 15.1. Independent Contractor. For the purpose of the Agreement each Party shall be, and shall be deemed to be, an independent contractor and not an agent, partner, joint venturer or employee of the other Party. Neither Party shall have authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any kind, or to take any action which shall be binding on the other Party (except as may be explicitly provided for herein or authorized in writing), and each Party agrees not to purport to do so. 15.2. Assignment. The Agreement shall not be assigned and is not assignable or delegable by either Party without the written consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that Sekisui and Qualigen each may assign this Agreement without the consent of the other to a successor in connection with the merger, consolidation or sale of such Party or of all or substantially all of its assets or the portion of its business to which this Agreement relates. 15.3. No Waiver. Failure of either Party to enforce (or reasonable delay in enforcing) a right under this Agreement shall not act as a waiver of that right or the ability to later assert that right relative to the particular situation involved or to terminate this Agreement arising out of any subsequent default or breach. A waiver by a Party of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement in any instance shall not be deemed or construed to be a waiver of such term or condition for the future, or of any other term or condition hereof. 15.4. Severability. This Agreement is divisible and separable. If any provision of this Agreement is determined by a final and binding court judgment (for which no further appeal is possible) to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable to any extent, such provision shall not be not affected or impaired up to the limits of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability; the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected or impaired in any way; and the affected provision shall (if at all possible) be construed as if it had been written in such a way as to both be valid, legal and enforceable and to achieve, to the greatest lawful extent, the evident economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision (or portion of provision). 15.5. Notices. All notices required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given and made (i) if by personal delivery, on the date of such delivery, (ii) if by recognized overnight courier specifying next-business-day delivery, on the next business day after the date of deposit with such courier (by the courier's stated time for enabling next-business-day delivery), (iii) if by email, on the date sent by email if sent during normal business hours of the recipient, and on the next business day if sent after normal business hours of the recipient, and (iv) if by US registered mail, on the fifth business day following such mailing in the US, in each case addressed at the address shown below for, or such other address as may be designated by 10 days' advance written notice hereunder by, such Party.

Entire Agreement and Modification. The Agreement, including the Exhibits thereto, constitutes the entire understanding between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and cancels any previous or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, whether oral, written or implied, heretofore in effect, including any letter of intent, and sets forth the entire agreement between Sekisui and Qualigen with respect to the subject matter hereof (provided, that any and all previous nondisclosure/nonuse obligations, including the July 7, 2015 Confidential Disclosure Agreement) are not superseded and remain in full force and effect for all disclosures made prior to the date of this Agreement). Each Party acknowledges that it has not relied, in deciding whether to enter into this Agreement on this Agreement's expressly stated terms and conditions, on any representations, warranties, agreements, commitments or promises which are not expressly set forth within this Agreement. No agreements amending, altering, supplementing or waiving the terms hereof may be made except by the express terms of a written document signed by duly authorized representatives of the Parties. 15.7. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to its conflicts of laws principles. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall be inapplicable to this Agreement. 15.8. Attorney Fees. If litigation becomes necessary to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, the successful Party shall be entitled to recover from the other Party reasonable expenses, including attorneys' and other professional fees, in addition to any other available remedies. 26\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n15.9. Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and are in no way intended to describe, interpret, define or limit the scope, extent or intent of this Agreement or any provision hereof. 15.10. Counterparts; Delivery. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Signatures to this Agreement may be delivered by email attachment or other electronic transmission, and such signatures and such delivery shall be fully effective and binding on the Party sending the same. 15.11. Further Assurances. Each Party covenants and agrees to, without the necessity of any further consideration, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such further or other documents and instruments and take any such further or other action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement. 15.12. Force Majeure. No Party shall be liable to any other Party or be deemed to have breached or defaulted under this Agreement for failure or delay in the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement (other than obligations for the payment of money) for the time and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from acts of God, earthquake, riot, civil commotion, terrorism, war, strikes or other labor disputes, fire, flood, failure or delay of transportation, omissions or delays in acting by a governmental authority, acts of a government or an agency thereof or judicial orders or decrees or restrictions or any other like reason which is beyond the control of the respective Party. The Party affected by force majeure shall provide the other Party with full particulars thereof as soon as it becomes aware of the same (including its best estimate of the likely extent and duration of the interference with its activities), and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to overcome the difficulties created thereby and to resume performance of its obligations hereunder as soon as practicable, and the time for performance shall be extended for a number of days equal to the duration of the force majeure. 15.13. Equitable Relief. Each Party recognizes that the covenants and agreements herein and their continued performance as set forth in this Agreement are necessary and critical to protect the legitimate interests of the other Party, that the other Party would not have entered into this Agreement in the absence of such covenants and agreements and the assurance of continued performance as set forth in this Agreement, and that a Party's breach or threatened breach of such covenants and agreements will cause the opposed Party irreparable harm and significant injury, the amount of which will be extremely difficult to estimate and ascertain, thus making any remedy at law or in damages inadequate. Therefore, each Party agrees that an opposed Party shall be entitled to specific performance, an order restraining any breach or threatened breach of Section 13 and all other provisions of this Agreement, and any other equitable relief (including but not limited to temporary, preliminary and/or permanent injunctive relief), without the necessity of posting of any bond or security. This right shall be in addition to and not exclusive of any other remedy available to such other Party at law or in equity. 15.14. Rights and Remedies are Cumulative. Except to the extent as may be expressly set forth herein, all rights, remedies, undertakings, obligations and agreements contained in or available upon violation of this Agreement shall be cumulative and none of them shall be in limitation of any other remedy or right authorized in law or in equity, or any undertaking, obligation or agreement of the applicable Party. 27\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n15.15. Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as expressly set forth in Section 11, the terms and provisions of this Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of each Party hereto and their respective successors or permitted assigns and it is not the intention of the Parties to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person. 15.16. No Implied License. No right or license is granted to Sekisui by implication, estoppel, or otherwise to any know-how, patent or other intellectual property right owned or controlled by Qualigen. 15.17. Exhibits. The Exhibits referred to in the Agreement are deemed incorporated by reference at each place in the Agreement when reference is made thereto.

Actual 'Gross to Net' (GTN) Adjustments - consist of: a) discounts, refunds, rebates, sub distributor \"channel\" fees, chargebacks, retroactive price adjustments, and any other allowances given and taken which effectively reduce the net selling price (other than such which have already diminished the gross amount invoiced), including, without limitation, volume discounts. b) Product returns and allowances Net Revenue - Actual Gross Revenue less Actual GTN Adjustments Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) Components of COGS include: Actual Material Costs - Consists of: \u25cf Qualigen Bill of Material (BOM) Standard Costs (for instrument, reagent kit and related consumable products sold by Sekisui): \u25cb raw materials \u25cb component materials \u25cb packaging materials \u25cf Allocated standard shipping material costs, including envirocoolers, shipping boxes and filler materials \u25cf Actual cost of ice packs \u25cf Actual outbound freight expense (as applicable based on shipping terms) for sales and rentals of instruments, and sales of reagents and related consumables. Exhibit A-1\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note: Qualigen records costs of raw material, component, packaging and shipping materials (excluding ice packs) at standard, and records manufacturing variances including purchase price and material usage variances as part of Labor & Overhead. If Qualigen's manufacturing variances exceed 3% of its total production costs in any True-Up Period referenced in Exhibit D, such variances are to be allocated between inventory and COGS based on total inventory turns for the applicable True-Up Period) Actual Labor & Overhead Costs - Consists of: Instrument and Reagent Manufacturing Cost Center Expenses - Including direct instrument and reagent manufacturing-related wages and related taxes and benefits, direct Property Plant & Equipment depreciation, direct production supplies, direct production-related repairs & maintenance expenses, inbound freight expenses, material variances and allocated manufacturing-related occupancy expenses for expenses such as rent, utilities, janitorial services, telephone expense, supplies and depreciation. Reagent manufacturing also includes an allocation of R&D department expenses relating to formulation oversight. In Qualigen's FY 2016 financial data, this allocation represented approximately $60k. Workers' comp insurance is included as part of the occupancy allocation in Qualigen's FY2016 financial results. Beginning with Qualigen's FY 2017 financial reporting, Workers' comp insurance will be included as a direct allocation to the Instrument and Reagent Manufacturing cost centers based on salary amounts.

Currently, the Medical Device Excise Tax provision of the Affordable Care Act is repealed (from Jan. 2016 through December 2017). However, should this provision be re-enacted, or similar such provision enacted, the cost of such excise taxes will be included as a cost element included in Actual Cost of Goods. The margin share and true-up process will reflect this cost.

Going forward, transfer prices for Products other than reagent kits will be set as of each October 1 and April 1 for the prospective 6-month period based on Qualigen's standard unit cost in effect on the first day of the month prior to the date the new transfer prices are agreed upon (either September 1 and March 1) for the prospective 6-month period.

The true-up process will result in a payment due from either party, depending on which party has received excess Available Margin for the True-Up Period. True-ups will be determined every six months. The first true-up will be based on a stub period consisting of results from the first day of this Agreement to September 30, 2016. Table B below provides the true-up periods and Available Margin shares.

The process follows the following steps: 1) Qualigen provides Qualigen-incurred COGS information to Sekisui (see Table C) 2) Sekisui adds its Net Revenue information and Sekisui-incurred COGS information (see Table C) to the Qualigen-incurred COGS information and develops the first draft of the true-up calculation 3) Qualigen and Sekisui review and agree on the calculation. Both parties will use best efforts to complete the review and approval process in a timely manner. Note: to ensure the True-up calculation is available for recording in September or March results, both Qualigen and Sekisui need to be diligent in providing their data on a timely basis according to the dates set forth in Table B above.

JOINT VENTURE TO BE BOUND 24\n\nJOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT\n\nThis Joint Venture Agreement (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified in accordance herewith, this \"Agreement\") is entered into as of March 18, 2003 and is by and between Tate & Lyle Fermentation Products Ltd., a corporation organized under the laws of England (\"T&L\") and a subsidiary of Tate & Lyle PLC, and Igene Biotechnology, Inc., a Maryland corporation (\"Igene\"; collectively with T&L, the \"Parties\").\n\nRECITALS\n\nA.

The Parties agree to use commercially reasonable good faith efforts to negotiate with any applicable governmental authority in order to avoid any such limitations.\n\n3. PARTIES' CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE JOINT VENTURE AND FINANCING.\n\n3.1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, T&L shall contribute, or cause to be contributed, to the Operating Company cash in the amount of $21,614,000. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, T&L further agrees to pay to Operating Company as a contribution to capital upon Formation (as defined below) $3,000,000.\n\n3.2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Igene shall transfer and assign, or cause to be transferred and assigned,\n\n\n\n\n\nto the Operating Company the Transferred Assets described in Appendix 3.2.\n\n3.3. The Parties intend that the transfer of the Transferred Assets to the Operating Company pursuant to Articles 3.1 and 3.2 and the other various transactions, transfers, contributions and agreements to be made or entered by and between Igene or T&L and the Operating Company in connection with the formation of the Joint Venture, shall be made promptly upon the formation of both the Operating Company and the Manufacturing Company (\"Formation\"). In the event that the Transferred Assets are not transferred to the Operating Company at such time or on such other date as is specified herein or in the Asset Transfer Agreement, the entity who is to make such transfer(s) shall, without any further cost to the Joint Venture or to the other Party, (a) ensure that the Joint Venture shall have all of the benefits and bear all of the burdens of such assets on and from Formation and (b) fully and legally assign to the Operating Company such assets as soon after Formation as practicable.\n\n3.4. Title to the Transferred Assets shall be passed to the Operating Company in accordance with Asset Transfer Agreement to be entered into by the Operating Company and Igene upon Formation. Such Asset Transfer Agreement shall be in the form set forth in Appendix 3.4. Such Transferred Assets shall be contributed free and clear of any and all indebtedness, liens and encumbrances.\n\n3.5. As promptly as possible after Formation, the Manufacturing Company shall enter into a lease with Parent with respect to the lease of certain real property located in Selby, England adjacent to the existing facility of an Affiliate of Parent (the \"Site\"), which lease will have a term of at least 50 years at an annual rent of $1 and shall grant to the Manufacturing Company all rights necessary to construct and operate the Manufacturing Facility.\n\n3.6. Upon Formation, the Manufacturing Company shall enter into an Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management Agreement in the form set forth in Appendix 3.6 (the \"Construction Agreement\"), pursuant to which Parent shall supervise and manage the construction of the Manufacturing Facility on a turnkey basis in consideration for a payment of $21,614,000. Upon the entering into of the agreements referred to in Articles 3.5 and 3.6, the Operating Company shall capitalize the Manufacturing Company through the contribution of equity received by it from T&L pursuant to Article 3.1 in an amount equal to at least $21,614,000.\n\n3.7. It is the intention of the Parties that any debt incurred by the Joint Venture shall be non-recourse against each Party. Each of the Parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Venture to incur long-term indebtedness in an amount that is consistent with the business and cash desires of the Parties and the cash needs of the Joint Venture; provided, however, that neither Party shall be required to contribute any additional capital or guarantee, directly or indirectly, any debt of the Joint Venture including without limitation any leases or other direct or indirect obligations.\n\n4. PARTIES' INTERESTS IN THE JOINT VENTURE.\n\n4.1. The Parties shall each have a fifty percent (50%) interest in the Operating Company, and control of the Joint Venture shall be shared equally between the Parties. The Parties agree that their respective contributions to the Operating Company have equal value, and that no payment shall be made from one Party to the other Party in the event appraisals performed for tax accounting reasons of the Transferred Assets give rise or would give rise to different valuations.\n\n4.2. All profits and losses earned or incurred by the Operating Company shall be shared by the Parties in equal shares as long as each Party has a 50% interest in the Operating Company. Upon a reduction or increase in such interest, all profits and losses shall be shared in accordance with each Party's ownership interest in the Joint Venture. To the greatest extent permitted by applicable law and accounting provisions, (a) the Operating Company shall make distributions, dividends and returns of capital equally to each of the Parties and (b) Operating Company items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated equally to each of the Parties; provided, if for any reason, such distributions, dividends, returns of capital or allocations may not be made on an equal basis, the Operating Company shall make a special distribution, dividend, return of capital or allocation to one Party to balance the required distribution, dividend, return of capital or allocation to the other Party.\n\n4.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if for any reason the contribution of* T&L proves to have a value materially less than that attributed to it at the Effective Date as a result of the Facilities not being constructed as provided herein then either (a) T&L shall contribute a cash amount to the Operating Company to make up the shortfall or (b)(i) T&L's capital account shall be adjusted to reflect the revaluation of its contribution, (ii) T&L's interest in the Operating Company shall be adjusted to reflect its actual proportion of the contributions made upon the formation of the Joint Venture and (iii) the Joint Venture shall be liquidated as provided in Article 22.3.\n\n* Portions intentionally deleted pursuant to a request for confidential treatment.\n\n5. [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]\n\n\n\n\n\n6. TAX CONSIDERATIONS.\n\n6.1. Each Party shall produce and submit to the Board, as promptly as possible, a reasonable estimate of their respective income tax liability with respect to the income of the Operating Company computed pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph as by a reasonably prudent taxpayer attempting to reduce the income tax payable by such taxpayer to the greatest extent permitted by law (a \"Party Tax Estimate\"). A Party Tax Estimate shall be calculated pursuant to United States and/or United Kingdom law and regulations (and the laws and regulations of any other jurisdiction under which the earnings of the Operating Company may be taxable to either Party) as may be applicable to either Party. The tax liability shall be calculated based on each Party's share of the income, gain, costs, expenses and deductions of the Operating Company in the prior year without consideration of items of income, gain, loss or deduction applicable to either Party derived from outside the Operating Company (including, without limitation, with respect to Igene, any Net Operating Loss that Igene may have accumulated prior to the formation of the Joint Venture), but shall include any items of income, gain, loss or deduction derived from the Operating Company in any previous year to the extent applicable to such year. Such Party Tax Estimate shall not be deemed to be final until it is approved by the Board; provided, that if the Board does not approve the higher Tax Estimate, and cannot resolve such a dispute within thirty days of the submission of such Tax Estimate to the Board, then the lesser Tax Estimate (the \"Preliminary Minimum Distribution\") shall be paid to both Parties pursuant to Article 6.2 as if it were the Minimum Distribution. After the expiration of such thirty day period, the Board shall promptly submit the higher Tax Estimate (the \"Disputed Estimate\") to PricewaterhouseCoopers (the \"Neutral Auditor\") who shall evaluate the reasonableness and accuracy of the Disputed Estimate in light of the provisions of this Article 6.1. The Party that submitted the Disputed Estimate shall promptly provide to the Neutral Auditor all information requested by the Neutral Auditor in order to perform the analysis required by this Article 6.1. Within thirty days of receiving all information it deems necessary to perform the analysis required herein, the Neutral Auditor shall inform the Board in writing that it either agrees or disagrees that the Disputed Estimate is reasonable and accurate in light of the provisions of this Article 6.1 and the tax information submitted to it. If the Neutral Auditor concludes that the Disputed Estimate is reasonable and accurate, the difference between the Disputed Estimate and the Preliminary Minimum Distribution shall be promptly paid to each Party. If the Neutral Auditor concludes that the Disputed Estimate is not reasonable and/or accurate then the Preliminary Minimum Distribution shall be deemed the Minimum Distribution for the applicable year; provided, however, that if the Neutral Auditor concludes that an amount greater than the Preliminary Minimum Distribution is appropriate, then such greater amount shall be deemed the Minimum Distribution for the applicable year. The costs of the Neutral Auditor shall be paid equally by the Parties.\n\n6.2. Subject to the provisions of Article 6.1, the Operating Company shall annually declare and pay by March 15 a distribution to each Party equal to the larger of the two estimated annual tax liabilities as reflected on the approved Party Tax Estimates (the \"Minimum Distribution\"). A portion of the Minimum Distribution shall be paid in advance on a quarterly basis should either Party be required to pay periodic mandatory payments of estimated taxes during any given year. In the event that such estimated taxes are required to be paid by either Party, such Party shall notify the Operating Company of the date of such required payments and the Operating Company shall pay to each Party, no later than 5 business days prior to the due date of each quarterly estimated tax payment specified in the notice above, an amount equal to 25% of the estimated Minimum Distribution. In the event that such distributions of estimate taxes are made within a given year, then the distribution on March 15 of the subsequent year shall be adjusted to reflect the advance distributions of related estimated taxes made prior to that date.\n\n6.3. The Operating Company shall annually within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year declare an additional distribution equal to 20% of the net income of the Operating Company, half of which is to be paid to each Party (the \"Target Distribution\"). The Target Distribution shall be paid except when the Board shall determine otherwise.\n\n6.4. The Board may pay other distributions at its discretion.\n\n6.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Operating Company shall only pay distributions or dividends to the extent permitted by applicable law.\n\n7. PARTIES' WITHDRAWAL FROM THE FIELD OF AGREEMENT.\n\n7.1. Each Party shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, do all such things and shall take all such steps as are reasonably necessary to effect its total withdrawal from the Field of Agreement. Such withdrawal shall be effective from the Effective Date.\n\n7.2. After the Effective Date and as long as Igene and T&L continue to own an interest in the Operating Company, neither of the Parties shall, or shall cause or permit any of their Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, as stockholders, consultants, members, partners or in any other capacity, engage in any enterprise or business anywhere in the world, which (a) manufactures Astaxanthin or (b) develops, markets, or sells products falling within the Field of Agreement. In the event that either (x) one Party shall transfer its entire interest in the Operating Company as permitted pursuant to this Agreement and the Operating Company shall remain a going concern after the closing of such transfer or (y) both Parties sell their interest in the Operating Company as permitted pursuant to this Agreement and the Operating Company shall remain a going concern after the closing of such transfer, then any Party which\n\n\n\n\n\nceases to own an interest in the Operating Company as a result of such transfer shall remain subject to the terms of this Article 7.2 for a period of ten (10) years after the date of such transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the obligations set forth in this Article 7.2 are unreasonable in scope, time or geography, such court is hereby authorized by the Parties to enforce such provisions with narrower scope, shorter time or lesser geography as such court determines to be the maximum that is reasonable and proper in the circumstances.\n\n7.3. Except as set forth in Articles 7.1, 7.2, 8.1 and 8.2, it is explicitly agreed that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent either Party or any of their respective Affiliates from engaging, directly or indirectly, in any enterprise, which develops, manufactures, markets, or sells products that are not within the Field of Agreement, and except as set forth in Articles 7.1, 7.2, 8.1 and 8.2, either Party shall be free to engage in any business, enterprise, or undertaking, or to make any investment it chooses.\n\n8. FUTURE PRODUCTS AND DEVELOPMENTS.\n\n8.1. If, after the date of this Agreement and continuing as long as either Party is a partner, member, or shareholder of the Operating Company, such Party or any of its Affiliates receives or discovers any opportunity within the Field of Agreement, including without limitation developing or completing the development of, or discovering, or acquiring proprietary rights over, a product or process that falls within the Field of Agreement, the Operating Company then shall have exclusive rights to exploit such opportunity, but only within the Field of Agreement. The Party (or its Affiliate) that has developed, discovered or acquired such opportunity, product or process will, however, be entitled to exploit such opportunity, product or process for application outside the Field of Agreement.\n\n8.2. If, after the date of this Agreement and continuing as long as either Party is a partner, member, or shareholder of the Operating Company, such Party or any of its Affiliates receives or discovers any opportunity to use Astaxanthin as a Neutraceutical (a \"Neutraceutical Opportunity\"), including without limitation developing or completing the development of, or discovering, or acquiring proprietary rights over, a product or process that involves the use of Astaxanthin as a Neutraceutical, such Party shall (or shall cause its Affiliate to) present such opportunity to the Operating Company, providing the Operating Company with such narrative description and budgetary and other information as such Party (or its Affiliates) may have generated or gathered to the extent necessary to evaluate such Neutraceutical Opportunity. The Board shall consider the material presented by such Party and its Affiliates and shall elect whether the Joint Venture should pursue such Neutraceutical Opportunity. If the Board elects to pursue such Neutraceutical Opportunity, the Operating Company then shall have exclusive rights to exploit such Neutraceutical Opportunity, but solely with respect to use of Astaxanthin as a Neutraceutical, and, subject to Article 8.1, the Party (or its Affiliate) that has developed, discovered or acquired such opportunity, product or process will, however, be entitled to exploit such opportunity, product or process for application outside of use of Astaxanthin as a Neutraceutical. If however the Board does not elect to pursue such Neutraceutical Opportunity, the Party (or its Affiliate) that has developed, discovered or acquired such opportunity, product or process shall, subject to Article 8.1, be entitled to exploit such opportunity, product or process; provided, that subsequent developments or discoveries with respect to such Neutraceutical Opportunity would reasonably be expected to affect the Board's acceptance or rejection of such Neutraceutical Opportunity, such Party shall (or shall cause its Affiliate to) present such Neutraceutical Opportunity to the Board with reference to the pertinent subsequent developments or discoveries.\n\n8.3. If, after the date of this Agreement and continuing as long as a Party is a partner, member, or shareholder of the Operating Company, the Joint Venture develops or completes the development of, or discovers, or acquires proprietary rights over, a process or product which at, or after, the time of its development, discovery or acquisition has, or might have, some application outside of the Field of Agreement, then the appropriate entity of the Joint Venture shall offer to license the use of the process or product (or the production thereof) for such application to each of the Parties on reasonable commercial terms (including, without limitation, the possible payment of royalties at market rates) taking into account the time and money spent by the Joint Venture and taking into account other relevant commercial factors. The grant of licenses to any third parties shall be the prerogative of the Board provided that no such license shall be granted at terms more favorable to the third party than were offered to the member(s) of such Party.\n\n8.4. In the event either T&L or Igene wishes to market Astaxanthin for uses other than in the Field of Agreement, including but not limited to the use of Astaxanthin as a neutraceutical or otherwise for direct human consumption, either T&L or Igene, as the case may be, shall be permitted to purchase reasonable quantities of Astaxanthin from the Operating Company for use in the manufacture of such products at the Average Market Price. The Joint Venture will manufacture such Astaxanthin to the standard required for its business, and each Party desiring to market Astaxanthin for other uses shall process the product acquired from the Operating Company at its own cost and expense.\n\n9. MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF THE JOINT VENTURE.\n\n9.1. The Joint Venture will be managed and controlled by a board of directors comprised of six (6) members (the \"Board\"). Each Party shall appoint three (3) of such members (none of whom shall be residents of the United Kingdom) and shall be entitled to\n\n\n\n\n\nappoint any successor appointees as necessary such that the Board shall always be comprised of three members appointed by each Party. Each Party shall be entitled to appoint alternate directors on a periodic and temporary basis as needed. Each party agrees at all times to vote in favor of the directors appointed by the other Party or any successor appointees.\n\n9.2. The Board shall have a Chairman selected in odd-numbered years by Igene and in even-numbered years by T&L for the duration of the calendar year. The Party with the right to select the Chairman shall select the Chairman from among the members of the Board appointed by it. If for any reason the individual serving as the Chairman ceases to be a member of the Board, such individual shall also cease to serve as Chairman and the Party who appointed such individual to the Board may select another individual appointed by that Party to the Board to serve as Chairman through the remainder of such calendar year. The Chairman shall serve as the chairman of all meetings of the Board and shall serve in such other administrative capacities as may be appropriate or as the Board may determine from time to time, but the Chairman shall not have any additional vote or authority by virtue of being the Chairman.\n\n9.3. The Board shall have regular meetings at least once each calendar quarter which shall be called by the Chairman by written notice delivered to each Board member no later than five business days prior to the meeting specifying the date, time and place for such meeting. Either Party may at any time provide the Chairman with a written request that the Chairman convene a special meeting, whereupon the Chairman shall call a special meeting to be held within two weeks after receipt of such request by written notice delivered to each Board member no later than five business days prior to the meeting specifying the date, time and place for such meeting. Any member of the Board may attend a meeting by telephonic equipment if such member may hear and be heard by all present at that meeting (including others participating telephonically).\n\n9.4. The decisions of the Board shall be by majority vote of the members present at a meeting, provided that such majority vote includes the affirmative vote of at least one member appointed by each Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after either Party either has an Event of Bankruptcy or is and continues to be in material breach of this Agreement (unless such breach is being contested by the breaching party in good faith) and no director appointed by such Party attends a duly convened meeting of the Board (after notice delivered pursuant to Article 9.3), the affirmative vote of three members of the Board at a duly convened meeting of the Board shall constitute approval of the Board for all purposes hereunder, regardless of whether a member of the Board appointed by each Party approves such matter.\n\n9.5. The Board shall establish various authorizations and delegations for Management (as described below) to conduct the business of the Joint Venture as contemplated by Article 1.1 hereof.

The Joint Venture shall be jointly controlled by the Parties who, as shareholders, members, or partners, shall have the exclusive power, by instructing the Board, to: (i) dissolve the Joint Venture, (ii) sell, or dispose of all or substantially all assets of the Joint Venture or permit the Joint Venture to place or grant any consensual lien or security interest on its assets (except liens for taxes and materialsmen's liens being contested in good faith which are not material in amount), or (iii) permit the Joint Venture to engage in material commerce outside the Field of Agreement or change the scope of the Field of Agreement. Upon receipt of such instructions, the Board shall act in accordance with this Article 9.\n\n10. DAY-TO-DAY MANAGEMENT OF THE JOINT VENTURE.\n\n10.1. Except as provided in Article 9.5, the Board shall delegate the conduct of the day-to-day business of the Joint Venture to the General Manager, together with the officers and employees of the companies providing the services set forth in Article 11 (collectively the \"Management\"). The General Manager shall also have whatever title is appropriate for each entity in the Joint Venture reflecting his or her role as the primary manager and officer of each entity. The initial General Manager will be Peter Boynton who will be secunded to the Joint Venture on a part-time basis.\n\n10.2. Subject to Article 9.5 and the direction of the Board, the Management shall direct, supervise and conduct the business of the Joint Venture in the following areas:\n\n(a) creation, development, and implementation of routine commercial policies and procedures;\n\n(b) creation, development, and implementation of sales and marketing strategies;\n\n(c) treasury and financial management;\n\n(d) manufacturing, maintenance and other operations;\n\n(e) legal services; and\n\n(f) research and development.\n\n11. SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED TO THE JOINT VENTURE BY THE PARTIES.\n\n11.1. Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, each Party will enter into an agreement or agreements substantially in the form attached hereto as Appendix 11.1.1 and Appendix 11.1.2 pursuant to which each Party or its Affiliates shall provide the services identified for it below (the \"Support Services Agreements\", and each a \"Support Services Agreement\"). The Support Services Agreements shall provide that the parties will provide the following services to the Joint Venture:\n\n11.1.1.Igene or its Affiliates will provide to the Joint Venture:\n\n(i) Sales and marketing services related to the world-wide sale and marketing of Astaxanthin in the Field of Agreement;\n\n(ii) Research services related to further development of the Technology and improvement of manufacturing process efficiencies, as requested by the Board from time-to-time; and\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii) Administration of the contract for manufacturing of Axtaxanthin with Fermic S.A. de Mexico pursuant to the terms of the Support Services Agreement.\n\n11.1.2.T&L or its Affiliates will provide to the Joint Venture:\n\n(i) Engineering and operations services;\n\n(ii) Technical and research services related to the further development of the Technology and improvement of manufacturing process efficiencies, as requested by the Board from time-to-time;\n\n(iii) Transportation and logistics services; and\n\n(iv) Finance and accounting services.\n\n11.1.3.The charge for the services set forth in Article 11.1.1 and 11.1.2 is set forth in the appropriate Support Services Agreement and shall be paid by the Operating Company.\n\n11.1.4.T&L or its Affiliates shall also provide certain utilities and waste treatment services to the Joint Venture from its existing facility located at the Site. Such services shall be reimbursed by the Operating Company in an amount as more fully set forth in the appropriate Support Services Agreement.\n\n11.2. In the event that either Party conveys its interest in the Operating Company to the other or a third party during the five year period commencing on the Effective Date and the Joint Venture continues to operate as a going concern thereafter, each Party shall provide the services described in Article 11.1 to the Joint Venture at a price (that shall reasonably be consistent with the methodology used for determining prices prior to such conveyance) to be agreed upon by the Parties for a transition period to allow the owner or owners of the Operating Company to obtain such services for the Joint Venture independently. Such transition period shall not exceed 24 months for the services set forth in Article 11.1.1 and Article 11.1.2 and shall not exceed 36 months for the services set forth in Article 11.1.4; provided, however, if T&L shall give notice to Igene that it intends to close the Selby, England facility adjacent to the Site, T&L shall be required to provide the services set forth in Article 11.1.4 for a period not to exceed 24 months from the date Igene receives such notice.\n\n11.3. In the event of a contradiction between the terms of this Article 11 and any Support Services Agreement, the terms of the Support Services Agreement shall govern.\n\n12. RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL; TERMINATION OF THE JOINT VENTURE AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n12.1. RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL; TAG-ALONG RIGHTS.\n\nPrior to one year from the Effective Date, a Party may not sell or otherwise transfer its interest in the Operating Company. Thereafter, any sale or other transfer may not be effectuated except pursuant to a good faith, arms' length offer to sell its entire ownership interest in the Operating Company for cash consideration to a party who is not affiliated with such Party (a \"Third Party Offer\"). If either Party has received a Third Party Offer that it intends to accept (the \"Offer\"), such Party (the \"Selling Party\") shall notify the other Party (the \"Offeree\") of the Offer, which notice shall include a copy of the Offer and any other information necessary to enable the Offeree to evaluate reasonably the Offer and the potential purchaser. The Offeree shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice from the Selling Party (the \"Option Period\") to elect either (i) to purchase the Selling Party's interest in the Operating Company or (ii) to sell the Offeree's interest in the Operating Company to the Selling Party, in either case on the same terms and conditions as those contained in the Offer. If the Offeree makes one of such elections, the applicable purchase and sale shall take place within sixty (60) days after the date of the Offeree's election in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Offer or such other terms and conditions as the Selling Party and the Offeree shall mutually agree. If the Offeree does not make one of such elections within the Option Period, the Selling Party shall have the right to sell its interest to the person or entity who made the Third Party Offer for cash consideration only on terms and conditions no more favorable to such person or entity within sixty (60) days after the expiration of the Option Period. If such sale is not completed within such sixty (60) day period, the offer from the Selling Party shall be deemed to have been revoked and any subsequent offer from such Selling Party shall be subject to the right of first refusal described herein.\n\n12.2. TERMINATION OF THE JOINT VENTURE.\n\n(a) If there is an Event of Bankruptcy with respect to either Party, then the other Party may elect either to terminate the Joint\n\n\n\n\n\nVenture (and follow the liquidation procedures set forth in Article 22.3) or to purchase the interest of the Party who had an Event of Bankruptcy for a purchase price equal to the market value of such interest as determined pursuant to subsection (c). Such election shall occur within 60 days after the Event of Bankruptcy unless prohibited by a bankruptcy court or other court of competent jurisdiction; provided that once any such prohibition is no longer applicable, such election shall occur promptly thereafter. The other Party shall provide written notice to the Party who had an Event of Bankruptcy upon the election of the other Party, which notice shall specify the effective date of the action elected by the other Party.\n\n(b) If the Parties shall agree to terminate the Joint Venture pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Parties agree to terminate the Joint Venture and follow the liquidation procedures set forth in Article 22.3 unless the Parties otherwise agree.\n\n(c) Upon delivery by either Party of such Party's election to purchase the interest of the other Party upon the other Party having an Event of Bankruptcy, the Board shall meet for the purpose of retaining a mutually acceptable, qualified investment banking, accounting or appraisal firm of national reputation with no conflict of interest with respect to either Party or any Affiliate thereof (a \"Qualified Expert\") to determine the market value of the Operating Company. If the Board is unable to select by unanimous agreement a single Qualified Expert, then the appraisal shall be arrived at by mutual agreement of two Qualified Experts, one selected by each Party. If in such an instance either Party shall fail to appoint a Qualified Expert within fifteen (15) days after a written request to do so, such failure shall be deemed acceptance of the conclusions and appraisal of such Qualified Expert as has been appointed. If the Board unanimously selects a single Qualified Expert, the value of the Operating Company as determined by such Qualified Expert shall be final and binding upon both of the Parties. If two Qualified Experts are chosen, one by each Party, and such Qualified Experts either agree or the greater of the two valuations is no more than 110% of the lesser valuation, the average of the valuations of the Operating Company as determined by each such Qualified Expert shall be the value of the Operating Company for the purposes of this Article 12.2 and shall be final and binding upon both Parties. If two Qualified Experts are chosen, one by each Party, and such Qualified Experts cannot agree within thirty (30) days of the appointment of the second of such Qualified Expert (or their valuations differ by more than 10%), then (i) the two appointed Qualified Experts shall select a third Qualified Expert, (ii) if the determination of any of the three Qualified Experts is greater than the two smallest determinations or smaller than the two greatest determinations, in either case by more than 125% of the difference between such other determinations, such determination will be disregarded and the average of the two remaining determinations shall be final and binding upon both of the Parties and (iii) otherwise, the average of the three determinations of the three Qualified Experts shall be final and binding upon both of the Parties. The market value for the interest of the Party who has had an Event of Bankruptcy shall equal the market value of the Operating Company as determined above times the interest of such Party in the Operating Company as stated in Article 4.1.\n\n13. LIABILITIES.\n\n13.1. Igene (the \"Indemnifying Party\") shall indemnify and hold harmless T&L, its Affiliates, the Operating Company and the Manufacturing Company, and their respective officers, directors, shareholders and agents (collectively, the \"Indemnified Parties\") from and against any and all claims, demands, actions, lawsuits, proceedings, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements incurred by any of the Indemnified Parties in respect of any such claims, demands, actions, lawsuits or proceedings) arising from any actual or alleged infringement of any patent, trademark, trade name, trade dress, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right (whether under the laws of any country or of the European Union) resulting from the ownership or use of the Technology by Igene or as contemplated herein, including without limitation a failure of the Operating Company to have unencumbered rights in the Technology as a result of the pending lawsuit (the \"Lawsuit\") styled Archer Daniels Midland Corporation v. Igene Biotechnology, Inc., United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Case No. S97-2358, or any similar claim.\n\n*\n\n* Intentionally deleted pursuant to a request for confidential treatment.\n\n14.

There has arisen, after the date of this Agreement, any bona fide claim or litigation involving, directly or indirectly, one or both of the Parties, of any member of either Party, or any shareholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of any Party, which may reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the Transferred Assets and/or the business falling with the Field of the Agreement; or\n\nD.

ENTIRE AGREEMENT; CONFIDENTIALITY.\n\nA. This Agreement, including the Appendices attached to this Agreement and the Recitals set forth herein, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and all prior representations, discussions and negotiations between the Parties and/or their representatives pertaining to the subject matter of this Agreement are superseded. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the terms and provisions of the certain Nondisclosure Agreement dated as of March 19, 2001 as amended August 5, 2002 between the Parties shall remain in effect.\n\nB. Each Party (the \"Recipient Party\") agrees to hold in confidence and not to disclose either directly or indirectly to any third party any technical, financial, commercial or other information (the \"Information\") as may be revealed or disclosed orally, in writing or otherwise to it by the other Party or by the Joint Venture (the \"Disclosing Party\") and shall refrain from using any such Information for any purpose whatsoever other than for the purpose(s) for which the Information was disclosed or unless previously approved in writing by the Disclosing Party; provided, however, that these obligations shall not apply to Information:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) which at the time of disclosure to the Recipient Party was in the public domain,\n\n(ii) which after disclosure to the Recipient Party becomes part of the public domain through no fault of said Party,\n\n(iii) which at the time of disclosure to the Recipient Party was in its possession or was independently developed by the Recipient Party (and the Recipient Party can demonstrate such by written documents dated before the time of disclosure),\n\n(iv) which disclosure is obtained by the Recipient Party from a third party which has not, either directly or indirectly, received the Information from the Disclosing Party; or\n\n(v) which disclosure is required otherwise by law, unless compelled to disclose such documents or information by judicial or administrative process.\n\nSpecific Information shall not be deemed to be within the foregoing exceptions merely because such specific Information may be construed as being within broader, non- confidential information which is either in the public domain or in the possession of the Receiving Party at the time of the disclosure of such Information, nor shall a combination of features which form Information be deemed to be non-confidential merely because the individual features, without being combined, are non-confidential. In any such instance where disclosure appears to be compelled by law, the first Party will notify the other Party so that such Party may avail itself of such measures as may be available for protecting the confidentiality of such information; provided, however, that neither Party will be prohibited from using such documents and information in litigation against the other Party.\n\nC. The Parties shall cause the Operating Company and the Manufacturing Company to adhere to similar obligations of confidentiality as set forth above with respect to Information received by it from either Party.\n\nD.

COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Signatures to this Agreement may be given by facsimile or other electronic transmission, and such signatures shall be fully binding on the Party sending the same.\n\n21.6. AMENDMENT; WAIVER; HEADINGS. No waiver, modification or amendment of any provision, term, or condition of this Agreement shall be of any force or effect unless in writing and executed by each of the Parties.

From time to time, each Party shall have the right to have its own internal or external auditors review the books and records of the Joint Venture.\n\n21.8. SUPREMACY. Other than as set forth in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and any other document related to the subject matter of this Agreement, which may be entered into by the Parties or between a member of any Party and the Joint Venture, from time to time, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail in each case, unless the Parties otherwise expressly agree in writing.\n\n21.9. TAX MATTERS. Each Party shall prepare its tax reports and returns in a manner not inconsistent with the tax reports and returns of the Operating Company, except in the case of manifest error.\n\n21.10. GUARANTEE. Parent hereby guarantees the performance by T&L of all of its obligations hereunder.\n\n22. DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES; LIQUIDATION.\n\n22.1. At any time for so long as both T&L and Igene own an interest in the Operating Company, at the request of either Party in a written notice to the other Party's appointees to the Board, the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve expeditiously any controversies, claims or disputes between the Parties that may arise from time to time under this Agreement or otherwise relating to the Joint Venture (each a \"Board Dispute\"). If, after a Board Dispute is addressed and recorded in the minutes in two regular\n\n\n\n\n\nquarterly Board meetings without resolution of such Board Dispute, then any such matter not so resolved shall be referred (by written notice by either Party to the other Party's general counsel and the other Party's appointees to the Board) to the Party Heads, who shall have an initial meeting with respect to such matters within ten days of the date of such referral notice, and who shall thereafter negotiate in good faith with each other for an additional twenty day period following the date of such initial meeting in an attempt to resolve any open issues.\n\n22.2. If any Board Dispute is not resolved through the procedure set forth in Article 22.1 after expiration of all of the time specified therefor, either Party, in the thirty day period beginning upon the end of the twenty day period described in Article 22.1, may provide the other Party with a written notice (the \"Offer Notice\") stating that such Board Dispute is not resolved and setting forth a price (the \"Offer Price\") and a list of three acceptable closing dates not less than ninety days after the expiration of the twenty-one day period referred to in the next sentence; provided, that an Offer Notice may not be served earlier than (i) with respect to a Board Dispute arising pursuant to Article 9.5(a) (General Manager Appointment), 9.5(k) (Operating Plans) (except as provided in subclause (ii) below), eighteen months from the Commencement Date, (ii) a Board Dispute arising pursuant to Article 9.5(b) (Capital Expenditures) or 9.5(k) (Operating Plans) that involves a contemplated expenditure which can be financed solely by the Joint Venture from its internal resources and/or using funds provided on normal commercial terms by any other party without any contribution or guaranty from either Party, eighteen months from the Commencement Date and (iii) with respect to any other Board Dispute, fifty-four months from the Effective Date. Upon receipt of an Offer Notice, the other Party must elect prior to the expiration of twenty-one days either to (a) sell its interest in the Operating Company for the Offer Price or (b) purchase the interest of the Party providing the Offer Notice for the Offer Price, which election in either case may be in a written notice which also specifies which of the closing dates identified in the notice delivered to such Party is preferred by such Party. On the closing date specified in the response notice, the Parties shall consummate the transaction selected in the response notice unless both Parties expressly agree otherwise. The Party initiating the notice provided herein, shall be required to provide such Support Services as agreed in the appropriate Support Services Agreement described in Article 11.1 to the surviving entity at a price (that shall be reasonably consistent with the methodology used for determining prices prior to such conveyance) to be agreed upon by the Parties for a transition period to allow the Operating Company to continue to obtain such services. Such transition period shall not exceed 12 months for the services set forth in Article 11.1.1 and Article 11.1.2 and shall not exceed 24 months for the services set forth in Article 11.1.4. The Party whose interest in the Operating Company is purchased shall take all reasonable steps to cooperate in the transition with the other Party so that the Joint Venture will be able to continue as an independent and functioning business after termination of the Support Services. For all purposes under this Article 22.2, if each Party delivers an Offer Notice to the other Party, the Offer Notice that is received on the earliest date shall be effective. If each Party receives an Offer Notice from the other Party on the same date, then the Offer Notice containing the highest cash Offer Price shall be effective.\n\n22.3. In the event the Parties (a) agree to liquidate the Joint Venture, (b) are required to liquidate the Joint Venture pursuant to Article 12.2 or (c) do not send any notice under Article 22.2 in the period allowed therefor, either Party may, by notice to the Board of such circumstance (the \"Liquidation Notice\"), commence the following liquidation process. Upon the Board's receipt of a Liquidation Notice, the Board shall meet to determine how to proceed. The Board may retain or appoint a Qualified Expert or any other person to value the Joint Venture and to advise it in liquidating the Joint Venture. Each Party may also retain or appoint such advisors and experts as it may deem appropriate to advise such Party with respect to the liquidation of the Joint Venture. From and after the Board's receipt of a Liquidation Notice, the Board shall proceed with the liquidation of the Joint Venture, and shall have no authority and shall not continue the regular operations of the Joint Venture except to the extent necessary or appropriate to preserve or increase the value of the assets of the Joint Venture; provided that, the Board may elect to, and upon express election by the Board thereby shall, for a specified period not to exceed six months, continue regular operations of the Joint Venture solely for the purpose of preserving its value while seeking to sell the Joint Venture as a whole, but if such period expires prior to the sale of the Joint Venture as a whole, the Board shall thereafter be required to sell the assets of the Operating Company reasonably expeditiously. The proceeds of any such liquidation shall be first used to pay the fees and expenses of the Qualified Experts and all remaining proceeds after payment of such fees shall be distributed between the Parties in proportion to their respective capital accounts.\n\n23. JOINT VENTURE TO BE BOUND.\n\nOn the Formation Date, each of the Parties shall cause the Joint Venture (and each of its constituent entities) to agree to and be irrevocably bound by the terms and provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, Article 13.\n\n[remainder of page intentionally left blank]\n\nIN WITNESS of the foregoing, the Parties have signed this Agreement as to the date first written above.\n\nTATE & LYLE FERMENTATION PRODUCTS LTD.

Shipper and Transporter may be referred to herein individually as a \"Party\" or collectively as the \"Parties\".   WITNESSETH:   WHEREAS, Shipper desires to contract with Transporter for transportation service on Transporter's Gathering System;   WHEREAS, Transporter is willing to transport Shipper's Crude Petroleum on the Gathering System for the compensation and subject to the terms and conditions set forth below;   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, covenants and conditions herein contained, Transporter and Shipper hereby agree as follows:   ARTICLE 1 DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION   1.1 Definitions. In addition to terms defined elsewhere in this Agreement and in Annex I hereto, the following definitions shall apply hereunder:   \"Agreement\" shall have the definition set forth in the preamble of this Agreement.   \"A.P.I.\" shall mean the American Petroleum Institute.   \"Barrel\" or \"Bbl\" shall mean forty-two (42) United States gallons at a temperature of sixty degrees (60\u00b0) Fahrenheit.   \"BS&W\" shall mean the basic sediment, water or other impurities found in a stream of Crude Petroleum.   \"Claiming Party\" shall have the meaning set forth in the definition of Force Majeure below.   \"Crude Petroleum\" shall mean the direct liquid products of oil wells, indirect petroleum products resulting either from distillate recovery equipment in gas and distillate fields, or a mixture of the direct product and indirect petroleum products.   \"Delivery Point\" shall mean the point(s) of interconnection between the Gathering System and one or more oil pipelines downstream of the Gathering System where Transporter delivers Crude Petroleum to Shipper. The initial Delivery Point shall be located at Grand Isle.\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \"Downstream Pipelines\" shall mean any pipeline or other receiving facility downstream of the Delivery Point.   \"Effective Date\" shall have the definition set forth in the preamble of this Agreement.   \"Force Majeure\" shall mean an event which is not within the reasonable control of the Party claiming suspension (the \"Claiming Party\"), and which by the exercise of due diligence the Claiming Party is unable to overcome in a commercially reasonable manner. Force Majeure includes, to the extent such event satisfies the requirements of the preceding sentence: acts of God; wars (declared or undeclared); insurrections; hostilities; strikes; lockouts; riots; floods; fires; storms; storm warnings; named or numbered tropical disturbances and evacuations associated with the threat of the same; industrial disturbances; acts of the public enemy; sabotage; blockades; epidemics; landslides; lightning; earthquakes; washouts; arrests and restraints of rulers and peoples; civil disturbances; explosions; breakage or accidents to machinery or lines of pipe; hydrate obstruction or blockages of any kind of lines of pipe; adverse operating conditions on Shipper's facilities, Transporter's facilities, or the facilities of Downstream Pipelines; repairs, improvements, replacements or alterations to plants, lines of pipe or related facilities; inability of either Party to obtain necessary machinery, drilling or workover rigs, materials, permits, easements or rights-of-way on reasonable terms; freezing of delivery facility; and other events beyond the reasonable control of Shipper that affect production levels; action or restraint by court order or public or governmental authority (so long as the Claiming Party has not applied for or assisted in the application for, and has opposed where and to the extent reasonable, such government action); provided, however, that none of the loss of Shipper's or its Affiliates' markets, Shipper's or its Affiliates' inability to obtain adequate capacity (other than for reasons of force majeure affecting a Downstream Pipeline), nor Shipper's or its Affiliates' inability economically to use or resell Crude Petroleum transported hereunder shall constitute an event of Force Majeure. A force majeure event that occurs respecting one or more Downstream Pipelines for which there are no reasonable alternatives for a Claiming Party to utilize in order to meet its duties and obligations under this Agreement, regardless of whether such Downstream Pipeline declared such force majeure event, shall constitute Force Majeure for purposes of this Agreement, subject to the requirement of the first sentence of this definition. The failure of a Claiming Party to settle or prevent a strike or other labor dispute with employees shall not be considered to be a matter within such Claiming Party's control.   \"Gathering System\" shall mean Transporter's Grand Isle Gathering System.   \"Month\" shall mean a period of time beginning at 7:00 a.m. Central Clock Time on the first day of a calendar month and ending at 7:00 a.m. Central Clock Time on the first day of the next succeeding calendar month.   \"Psig\" shall mean pounds per square inch gauge.   \"Receipt Point\" shall mean the point(s) of interconnection between the Gathering System and one or more oil pipelines or other interconnecting facilities located upstream of the Gathering System where Shipper delivers Crude Petroleum to Transporter. The initial Receipt Points are identified on Exhibit A.\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \"Shipper\" shall have the definition set forth in the preamble of this Agreement.   \"Transporter\" shall have the definition set forth in the preamble of this Agreement.   1.2 Other Terms. Other capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not defined in Section 1.1 above shall have the meanings ascribed to them throughout this Agreement.   ARTICLE 2 NOMINATIONS, SCHEDULING AND TRANSPORTATION   2.1 Nomination.   (a)  Applications for the transportation of Crude Petroleum shall be submitted in writing on Transporter's prescribed nomination of shipment form.   (b) Shipper desiring to nominate Crude Petroleum for transportation shall make such nomination to Carrier in writing on or before the twenty-fifth day of the month preceding the month during which the transportation under the nomination is to begin; except that, if space is available for current movement, a Shipper may nominate Crude Petroleum for transportation after the twenty-fifth day of the month preceding the month during which the transportation under the nomination is to begin.   2.2 Capacity Allocation.   (a) When pursuant to nominations hereunder, there shall be offered to Transporter more Crude Petroleum than can be immediately gathered and/or transported, the gathering and/or transportation shall be apportioned among all Shippers by Transporter on a just and reasonable basis.   2.3 Transportation.   (a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement and all applicable Laws, Transporter shall accept and transport Shipper's Crude Petroleum and redeliver the quantity of Crude Petroleum received by Transporter, less applicable Losses as set forth in Section 7.3, at the Delivery Point. Transporter shall be under no obligation to deliver the identical Crude Petroleum received, and reserves the right to make delivery out of its common stock.   2.4 Transporter's Right to Shutdown Operations.   (a) Transporter shall have absolute discretion and authority to partially or totally shutdown any and all operations and activities (and temporarily or permanently discontinue the services) contemplated hereunder at any time, if in Transporter's sole discretion, such shutdown is warranted to (i) ensure the safety of persons, property, or the environment; (ii) ensure the operational integrity of the Gathering System; or (iii) modify, inspect, maintain or repair the Gathering System. Transporter shall notify Shipper in writing in the event of any of the occurrences listed above. In such cases, Transporter shall not have any liability to Shipper for such shutdowns.\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (b) In the event interruption of service is required, Transporter's dispatcher will advise Shipper of an interruption as soon as practicable.   (c)  Nothing contained herein shall preclude Transporter from taking reasonable action(s) necessary to adjust receipts or deliveries hereunder in order to maintain the operational integrity of the Gathering System.   2.5 Line Fill and Tank Bottom Inventory.   (a) Either prior to or after the acceptance of Crude Petroleum for transportation, Transporter will, upon reasonable notice, require Shipper to provide a pro rata part of the volume of Crude Petroleum necessary for pipeline fill, unavailable stocks below tank connections, and reasonable additional minimum quantities required for efficient operation or to safeguard Transporter's tankage during passage of a tropical storm or hurricane. Crude Petroleum provided by Shipper for this purpose may be withdrawn after reasonable written notice of Shipper's intention to discontinue shipment in the Gathering System. Transporter may require advance payment of final transportation charges and settlement of any unpaid accounts receivable before final delivery will be made.   (b) In the event Shipper's inventory balance drops below its pro rata part of the volume of Crude Petroleum necessary for pipeline fill, unavailable stocks below tank connections, and reasonable additional minimum quantities required for the efficient operation of the system, then Transporter will require Shipper to provide the necessary volume to meet its pro rata part of such volume of Crude Petroleum.   (c) In the event that Shipper maintains an inventory balance after Shipper ceases movements on the Gathering System or Shipper gives written notice of its intent to cease movements over the system and Shipper is unable to schedule appropriate shipments to clear the inactive inventory balance, Shipper will be required to settle the inactive inventory balance through Transporter. In the event no such Shipper notice is given, then Transporter may require either an adjustment in Shipper's inventory balance or settlement of Shipper's inventory balance at any time after Shipper has ceased making movements under this Agreement for a period of six months. Such settlement will be based upon the fair market value of the Crude Petroleum, as published by Platts, at the time Shipper provides written notice of termination of this Agreement or if no such written notice is given, then at such time as Transporter calls for the settlement of the Shipper's inventory balance.   ARTICLE 3 RATES AND CHARGES   3.1 Transportation Charges. Crude Petroleum accepted for transportation by Transporter shall be subject to the transportation rates set forth on Exhibit A plus any other applicable charges specified in this Article 3.\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  ARTICLE 4 QUALITY AND PRESSURE SPECIFICATIONS   4.1 Quality Specifications. Transporter reserves the right to reject any and all shipments of: (i) Crude Petroleum delivered by Shipper to Transporter whose gravity, viscosity, and/or other characteristics are such that it is not readily susceptible to transportation through the Transporter's existing facilities and it will damage the quality of other shipments or cause disadvantage to other shippers and/or the Transporter; (ii) Crude Petroleum containing water, sediment and other impurities totaling in excess of one per cent as determined by centrifugal test, or by such other tests as may be agreed upon by the Shipper and Transporter; or (iii) Crude Petroleum where Shipper has failed to comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations made by any governmental authorities regarding shipment of Crude Petroleum.   4.2 Contaminants. Transporter has the right, at its discretion, to reject crude oil containing contaminants. If Transporter determines that a Shipper has delivered to Transporter's facilities Crude Petroleum that has been contaminated by the existence of and or excess amounts of impure substances, including but not limited to chlorinated and/or oxygenated hydrocarbons, arsenic, lead and/or other metals which results in harm to other shippers, Downstream Pipelines, users of the contaminated Crude Petroleum or Transporter, such Shipper will be excluded from further entry into applicable segments of the pipeline system until such time as the quality of the Crude Petroleum is to the satisfaction of the Transporter. Transporter is not responsible for monitoring receipts or deliveries for contaminants. Further, Transporter reserves the right to dispose of any contaminated Crude Petroleum blocking its pipeline system. Disposal thereof may be made in any reasonable manner including but not limited to commercial sales, and any liability associated with the contamination or disposal of any Crude Petroleum shall be borne by the Shipper introducing the contaminated Crude Petroleum into Transporter's system. Shipper liability includes, but is not limited to, claims from other shippers, carriers, or users of the contaminated Crude Petroleum and the costs of any regulatory or judicial proceeding.   4.3  Periodic Samples. Transporter reserves the right to periodically sample and test the quality of the Crude Petroleum delivered by Shipper at any Receipt Point. Transporter shall be responsible for all costs attributable to such periodic sampling and testing. If at any time Shipper's Crude Petroleum triggers any of the rejection rights set forth in Section 4.1, Shipper shall pay for any tests performed thereafter to establish that such Crude Petroleum no longer triggers such provisions.   4.4 Pressure. The present maximum operating pressure at all reception points is 1440 psig. Shipper's injection pressure shall be maintained within this stated maximum limit and shall conform, as near as possible, to the hydraulic gradient. Transporter reserves the right to reduce the maximum operating pressure by written notice to Shipper. Shipper shall furnish, or cause the producer from which Crude Petroleum is purchased to furnish, install, calibrate, and maintain continuous pressure recording devices at or near injection points to monitor pipeline operating pressures. Copies of the recording charts taken from these recording devices shall be furnished to Transporter on a weekly basis by Shipper. Shipper shall also furnish Transporter copies of annual calibration certificates for recording devices. Transporter reserves the right to witness calibration of these devices, and Shipper shall notify Transporter at least 48 hours prior to the initiation of such calibration procedures. Circumstances may arise which in Transporter's judgment require the Gathering System, or any part thereof, be shut down. Following such shutdown periods, Shippers shall obtain authorization from Transporter prior to the resumption of injections.\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  4.5 Excess Water, Sediment and Other Impurities. If during any monthly accounting period, the weighted average of the BS&W on all meter tickets covering Crude Petroleum delivered to Transporter by Shipper reflects a water, sediment and other impurities content which exceeds 1%, Shipper shall pay to Transporter a handling charge as specified in the table in Exhibit A on such excess water, sediment, and other impurities to cover the treating, separation and other aspects of handling such excess water, sediment and other impurities delivered to Transporter. This explicitly excludes disposal. Transporter shall accept excess water for handling only when Shipper has made the necessary arrangements for disposal of such excess water. Shipper may dispose of its excess water by method acceptable to Transporter such as barging or trucking subject to a mutually agreed upon schedule for excess water removal by Shipper from Transporter's Grand Isle tankage. As an alternative, Shipper may request Transporter to dispose of Shipper's excess water by use of Transporter's onshore disposal wells. The fees for disposal are set forth in Exhibit A. In any event, Shipper must contact Transporter in advance at 713-351-3000 to schedule means by which BS&W will be disposed. Where no meter tickets are available or meter tickets are in Transporter's opinion unreliable, water, sediment and other impurities in the system in excess of that reported on acceptable meter tickets will be allocated in a fair and equitable manner by Transporter. Notwithstanding the fact that Transporter levies a handling charge covering excess water, sediment and other impurities content in a Crude Petroleum stream, Transporter reserves the right to reject any nomination of products other than Crude Petroleum which satisfies all quality standards, requirements and conditions set forth herein.   ARTICLE 5 OFFSHORE PLATFORM FACILITIES AND OPERATING PROCEDURES   5.1 Transporter or its authorized representative shall have access to the platform from which shipments are received for the purpose of examining and checking meters and other installations utilized in connection with the handling of Crude Petroleum injected into the pipeline.   5.2  Shipper, upon request by Transporter, shall install, maintain and operate, or make arrangements with platform owners to install, maintain, and operate equipment to inject corrosion inhibitors, biocides, scale inhibitors, paraffin chemicals, or other chemicals as specified by Transporter.   5.3 Shipper shall provide or arrange with platform operator to furnish, operate, and maintain such pumping equipment as is necessary to inject the Crude Petroleum nominated by Shipper for shipment or will cause same to be done. Pumping equipment shall be controlled and operated so that the hourly rate at which Crude Petroleum is injected during each month shall not exceed 120% of the average hourly volume nominated and accepted for shipment during the current calendar month. If piston pumps are used, surge absorbers shall be installed, upon reasonable request of Transporter, to minimize pulsation. Transporter reserves the right, upon written notification to all Shippers to further limit the variation of Shipper's injection rates, if in Transporter's judgment proration is imminent. Reasonable exceptions to variations of injection rates for Shippers with newly discovered, expended production, and unusual production difficulties will be allowed by Transporter.\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  5.4  Physical and legal transfer of custody of Crude Petroleum to Transporter shall be at points where producer's or other delivering parties' lines are connected to Transporter's existing facilities, however, measurement of quantities received for the account of Shipper at such points shall be determined by measurement facilities installed on the production platforms where the Crude Petroleum is produced or to which it is moved for delivery into Transporter's existing facility.   5.5 The Transporter shall have the right to require uniform measurement and sampling equipment/procedures at all installations so that custody transfer measurements are made on a uniform basis. Transporter reserves the right to require Shipper to install or cause platform owners to install in accordance with applicable API and ASTM (American Society for Testing Materials) standards metering and meter proving equipment capable of continuous custody measurement, and devices for continuous proportional to-flow sampling of the Crude Petroleum.   5.6 If Crude Petroleum to be delivered to Transporter is produced at some distance from the Transporter's facilities and Transporter does not elect to provide a connection directly to the production platform where it is produced, Shipper may furnish, or cause to be furnished, free of cost to Transporter, the connecting pipeline required to deliver such Shipper's Crude Petroleum to the location designated by Transporter. If such location is on another producer's platform, all arrangement for installing the connecting pipeline or other required equipment or facilities on such platform shall be the sole responsibility of the Shipper.   5.7 At Transporter's request, Shipper will allow, or cause the platform owner(s) to allow, Transporter to place, operate, repair and maintain riser piping, scraper traps, valves, surveillance equipment, and any other equipment deemed by Transporter to be needed for the safe and efficient operation of the Gathering System. In the event Transporter should decide to transmit meter readings or other data from the platform from which Shipper's Crude Petroleum is run, Shipper will allow, or cause the platform owner(s) to allow, reasonable access to and use of communication facilities which may be available at the platform.   5.8 Where meter readings are available Transporter will prepare, as near as practicable to 7:00 a.m. on the first day of each month, a monthly pipeline run ticket for Shipper showing opening and closing meter readings and water, sediment, other impurities percentage on the basis of which Crude Petroleum and water, sediment, and other impurities volumes will be determined. If for any reason Transporter's representative fails to reach any receipt point on the first day of the month, Shipper's own representative, with prior authorization from Transporter, will obtain and make a record for Transporter's representative of the closing meter reading and will withdraw the sample material from the sampling equipment. The sample material thus withdrawn will be sealed in a special container and retained by Shipper's representative for Transporter's representative who will, during his next trip to that receipt point, determine the water, sediment, and other impurities percentage of the sample material in the special container and prepare the monthly pipeline run ticket. Where no meter readings are available, Crude Petroleum including water, sediment and other impurities will be determined by Transporter from the best available data.\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  5.9 It is recognized that from time to time producers inject acid into well formations containing Crude Petroleum in an attempt to stimulate production and fluids subsequently produced from such wells may contain unspent acid which must be neutralized to a pH of 4.5 or greater before the fluids (with which acid is produced) are delivered to Transporter. If such total fluids (Crude Petroleum plus unspent acid) is not so neutralized, the Gathering System may have to be shut down which in turn will require all connected producers to shut in their wells. To assist Transporter to anticipate the need and to prepare for possible corrective actions which may be required to void or minimize operating difficulties caused by any unneutralized acid, Shippers shall furnish, or cause the producer from which Crude Petroleum is purchased to furnish to Transporter, the following information at least 24 hours in advance of start of production from any well which has been acidized: (i) estimated time of first production from acidized well; (ii) estimated time that first production from acidized well, which has been neutralized to a pH equal to or greater than 4.5, will be injected into the Gathering System; and (iii) estimated time that produced fluids from previously acidized wells, which has been neutralized to a pH equal to or greater than 4.5, will be free of neutralized acids. Shipper shall assume full responsibility for and reimburse Transporter for all extra costs and expenses incurred by Transporter as the result of any unspent and/or unneutralized acids being present in the Crude Petroleum delivered to Transporter by Shipper. Shipper will be billed for all such extra costs and expenses for shutting down, purging of such unspent acids, and subsequent resuming operation of the Transporter's Gathering System. Transporter shall not be liable to any Shipper for any damage sustained by Shipper(s) as the result of unspent and/or unneutralized acids being received from other Shipper(s).   5.10 In the event that Shipper does not operate the wells from which the Crude Petroleum nominated for shipment is produced or does not operate the treating, measurement, or pumping equipment through which such Crude Petroleum is handled prior to its delivery to Transporter, then Shipper shall designate the party or parties responsible for the operation of such facilities and shall authorize and direct such party or parties to (1) comply with all provisions of this Agreement related to their operations and (2) furnish to Transporter such reasonably requested operational, technical, administrative, and analytical data as Transporter deems necessary to account for volumes being delivered to Transporter and assure safe, lawful, and efficient operations.   ARTICLE 6 GRAVITY BANK   6.1 To assure that no shipper will be materially damaged or allowed to benefit by changes in gravity due to the intermixing of petroleum in the Gathering System, Shipper will be required, as a condition of tendering, to participate in a Gravity Bank. The table of gravity differential values per barrel as attached hereto as Exhibit B is incorporated herein and made a part of this Agreement.\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  6.2 Transporter shall administer the Gravity Bank providing adjustments for the value of crudes with different qualities in the manner specified below for both receipt and delivery volumes. Applicable barrels and gravities shall be the net barrels at 60 degrees Fahrenheit (with no deduction for Loss allowance) and the gravities recorded by the Operator at points where it customarily records gravities and quantities. The weighted average gravity differential value per barrel (for two or more gravities of petroleum), as hereinafter referred to, shall be obtained in the following manner: multiply the gravity differential values per barrel (from the attached table as same is from time to time revised) by the number of barrels to which such gravity differential values are applicable and then divide the total of the resultant gravity differential values in dollars and cents by the total of the applicable barrels.   6.3 Adjustments between shippers shall be computed as follows: (i) compute the weighted average gravity differential value per barrel of the barrels received from by each shipper and (ii) compute the weighted average gravity differential value per barrel of the composite common stream for receipts.   6.4 Calculation:   (a) If the weighted average gravity differential value per barrel of a shipper as so determined under Section 6.3(i) above shall be greater than the weighted average gravity differential value per barrel of the aforementioned common stream petroleum as determined under Section 6.3(ii), the difference in cents per barrel shall be calculated and shipper shall be credited (receives) an amount calculated by multiplying said difference in gravity differential value per barrel by the applicable barrels.   (b) If the weighted average gravity differential value per barrel of a shipper is less than the weighted average gravity differential value per barrel of the aforementioned common stream petroleum, the difference shall be calculated as above outlined and a shipper debited for such difference.   (c) A sample calculation is attached as Exhibit C.   6.5 These calculations shall be made for each calendar month and the algebraic sum of the adjustments for the system shall be zero +/- One Dollar. If a shipper shall have a net debit balance in combining the two adjustments made above, the balance shall be remitted to the clearinghouse within fifteen (15) days from receipt of statement of such debit. If Shipper shall have a credit, the clearinghouse shall remit the amount thereof after receipt by the clearinghouse of the sums from those shippers having debits as calculated above.   ARTICLE 7 MEASUREMENT AND TESTING   7.1 Crude Petroleum tendered to Transporter for transportation shall be measured and tested by a representative of Transporter prior to its receipt from Shipper. Shipper shall have the privilege of being present or represented at the measurement and testing. Quantities shall be measured by meters and calculated in accordance with applicable A.P.I. Manual of Petroleum Measurement Standards. All shipments of required specifications will be received and delivered as net standard volume, as the total volume excluding water, sediment and other impurities, corrected by the appropriate volume correction factor for the observed temperature and A.P.I. gravity, relative density, or density to a standard temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit and also corrected by the applicable pressure correction factor and meter factor. Where measurement and testing of shipments to determine water, sediment, and other impurities content is not performed, the Transporter shall determine the water, sediment, and other impurities content of shipments based on the best available data. Due to the complexity of the allocations of the non-metered receipt locations, any prior period volume adjustment of 500 barrels or less will be corrected by including the corrected prior Months' (positive or negative) volume in the current month allocation process. Any shipper request for volume or quality adjustments prior to the most previous twenty-four (24) Month time frame will not be considered.\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  7.2  Evidence of Receipts and Deliveries. Transporter shall account to Shipper for Crude Petroleum received and delivered. Crude Petroleum received from Shipper and Crude Petroleum delivered to Shipper shall, in each instance, be evidenced by tickets, showing opening and closing tank gauges or meter readings, as applicable, temperature, basic sediment and water, and any other data essential to the determination of quantity. Such tickets shall be jointly signed by representatives of Transporter and Shipper, and shall constitute full receipt for (a) the Crude Petroleum received and (b) the Crude Petroleum delivered. Where meter tickets are not available or in Transporter's opinion are unreliable, Transporter shall use the best available data to determine the quantity of Crude Petroleum received and delivered. For receipt locations where custody transfer measurement is by Lease Automatic Custody Transfer (\"LACT\") unit or by allocation process, a deduction of twenty-five hundredths of one percent (0.25%) will be made to cover evaporation, interface losses and normal losses during transportation.   7.3 Losses.   (a) All shipments of Crude Petroleum of 50 degrees A.P.I. gravity or above shall be subject to a deduction to cover the shrinkage resulting from the mixture thereof, in the facilities of Transporter, with Crude Petroleum of A.P.I. gravity of 49.9 degrees or less according to the following table:   A.P.I. Gravity  (Degrees)    Deduction  50 through 59.9    1% 60 through 74.9    2% 75 through 84.9    3% 85 through 94.9    4% 95 through 104.9    5% 105 through 120.9    6%   (b) The quantity of Crude Petroleum deliverable shall be the net standard volume less shrinkage, evaporation, or any other losses in transit or due to leaks or pipeline breaks. All such shrinkage, evaporation, and gains or losses shall be assigned by Transporter to Shipper on a just and reasonable basis.\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  ARTICLE 8 TERM   8.1 Term. Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall remain in effect until terminated by either Party upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice.   8.2 Remedies Cumulative. Each Party shall have any and all remedies available to it under this Agreement, at law, or in equity for any breach by the other Party of the other Party's obligations under this Agreement. All such remedies are cumulative, not exclusive, and such Party may exercise any or all of such remedies in addition to or as an alternative to termination of the Term. No election of remedies shall be required or implied as the result of a Party's decision to avail itself of a remedy hereunder.   ARTICLE 9 TITLE AND CUSTODY   9.1 Title. A nomination of Crude Petroleum shall be deemed a warranty of title to such Crude Petroleum by Shipper, or a warranty of the good right to deliver such Crude Petroleum for transportation hereunder. Transporter may, in the absence of adequate security, decline to receive any Crude Petroleum which is in litigation, or as to which a dispute over title may exist, or which is encumbered by any lien. By nominating Crude Petroleum, Shipper also agrees to be responsible for any and all losses resulting from disputes, encumbrances, or failure of title thereto. Neither acceptance for transportation, nor redelivery by Transporter at the Delivery Point shall be deemed a representation by Transporter as to title.   9.2  Custody. As among the Parties, Shipper shall be in custody, control and possession of the Crude Petroleum affected by this Agreement at all times prior to delivery to Transporter at the Receipt Point and after redelivery by Transporter at the Delivery Point and Transporter shall have custody and control of the Crude Petroleum affected by this Agreement at all times after delivery by Shipper at the Receipt Point and prior to redelivery by Transporter at the Delivery Point.   ARTICLE 10 BILLING AND PAYMENT   10.1 Payment. All payments are due within 10 days of receipt of the invoice by ACH or wire transfer, unless the Transporter determines in a manner not unreasonably discriminatory that the financial condition of Shipper or Shipper's guarantor (if any) is or has become impaired or unsatisfactory or Transporter determines in a manner not unreasonably discriminatory it necessary to do so, in which case the payment due date shall be that specified in a written notice to the Shipper. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Shipper may withhold payment of amounts it disputes in good faith, provided that if any such amount is later determined to have been due Transporter Section 10.2 below shall apply to such amount.\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  10.2 Past-Due Interest. If any charge remains unpaid after the due date specified in Transporter's invoice, then such amount due may bear interest from the day after the due date until paid, calculated at an annual rate equivalent to the lesser of (1) 125% of the prime rate of interest, as of the date of Transporter's invoice, charged by the Citibank N.A. of New York, New York, for ninety (90) day loans made to substantial and responsible commercial borrowers or (2) the maximum rate allowed by law. In addition Shipper shall pay all documented costs incurred by Transporter to collect any unpaid amounts.   10.3 Setoff. In the event Shipper fails to pay any such undisputed charges when due, Transporter shall have the right to setoff such amounts owed and future amounts owed against those amounts Transporter owes Shipper.   10.4 In the event Transporter determines in a manner not unreasonably discriminatory that the financial condition of Shipper or Shipper's guarantor (if any) is or has become impaired or unsatisfactory or Transporter determines in a manner not unreasonably discriminatory it is necessary to obtain security from Shipper, Transporter, upon notice to Shipper, may require any of the following prior to Transporter's delivery of Shipper's Crude Petroleum in Transporter's possession or prior to Transporter's acceptance of Shipper's Crude Petroleum: (1) prepayment of all charges, (2) a letter of credit at Shipper's expense in favor of Transporter in an amount sufficient to ensure payment of all such charges and, in a form, and from an institution acceptable to Transporter, or (3) a guaranty in an amount sufficient to ensure payment of all such charges and in a form and from a third party acceptable to Transporter. In the event, Shipper fails to comply with any such requirement on or before the date supplied in Transporter's notice to Shipper, Transporter shall not be obligated to provide Shipper access to Transporter's facilities or provide services pursuant to this Agreement until such requirement is fully met.   ARTICLE 11 REMEDIES   11.1 Lien/Auction.   (a) Transporter shall have a lien on all Crude Petroleum delivered to Transporter to secure the payment of any and all transportation, or any other charges that are owed Transporter. Such lien shall survive delivery of Crude Petroleum to Shipper. Such lien shall extend to all Crude Petroleum in Transporter's possession beginning with Shipper's first receipt of transportation or other services from Transporter. The lien provided herein shall be in addition to any lien or security interest provided by statute or applicable law. Transporter may withhold delivery to Shipper of any of Shipper's Crude Petroleum in its possession and exercise any other rights and remedies granted under this Agreement or existing under applicable law until all such charges have been paid as provided above.   (b) If Shipper fails to pay the undisputed portion of an invoice by the due date, in addition to any other remedies under this Agreement or under applicable law, Transporter shall have the right, either directly or through an agent, to sell at a private sale any and all Crude Petroleum of such Shipper in its custody at fair market value at the time of sale. The proceeds of any sale shall be applied to the following order: (i) to the reasonable expenses of holding, preparing for sale, selling, and to the extent allowed by law, reasonable attorney's fees and legal expenses incurred by Transporter; and (ii) to the satisfaction of the Shipper's indebtedness including interest herein provided from the date of payment is due. The balance of the proceeds of the sale remaining, if any, shall be paid to Shipper or, if there is a dispute or claim as to entitlement, held for whoever may be lawfully entitled thereto.\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  11.2 Suspension of Performance. In the event Shipper fails to pay charges when due, Transporter shall not be obligated to provide Shipper access to Transporter's facilities or provide services pursuant to this Agreement until such time as payment is received by Transporter.   11.3 Legality of Shipments. Transporter reserves the right to reject any and all Crude Petroleum nominated for shipment when Shipper fails or is unwilling or unable to comply with all applicable Laws, or fails to reasonably demonstrate to Transporter that the shipment would be in conformance with the provisions of this Agreement.   11.4 Claims. As a condition precedent to recovery for losses or delay to shipments, claims must be filed in writing with Transporter within one year and one day after delivery of the Crude Petroleum, or, in case of failure to make delivery, then within one year and one day after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed; and suits arising out of such claims shall be instituted against the Transporter only within two years and one day from the date of delivery, or within two years and one day after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed. Where claims are not filed or suits are not instituted thereon in accordance with the foregoing provisions, Transporter shall not be liable and such claims will not be paid.   ARTICLE 12 FORCE MAJEURE   12.1 Force Majeure. If either Transporter or Shipper is rendered unable by an event of Force Majeure to carry out, in whole or part, its obligations hereunder and such Party gives notice and full details of the event to the other Party as soon as practicable after the occurrence of the event, then, pending such Force Majeure, but only during that period, the obligations of the Party affected by the event (other than the obligation to make payments then due or becoming due with respect to performance prior to the event) shall be canceled or suspended, as applicable, to the extent required; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, Shipper's obligation to pay the transportation charge set forth in Section 3.1 shall not be reduced, suspended or otherwise excused in any manner as the result of Force Majeure, regardless of which Party is affected. The Party affected by the Force Majeure shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remedy the Force Majeure condition with all reasonable dispatch, shall give written notice to the other Party of the termination of the Force Majeure, and shall resume performance of any suspended obligation promptly after termination of such Force Majeure; provided, that notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, a Party may elect, in its sole discretion, whether or not to repair or replace its facilities following catastrophic destruction of all or substantially all of such facilities.\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  ARTICLE 13 INDEMNIFICATION   13.1  Shipper shall release, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Transporter and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, consultants, representatives, and invitees from and against all claims and losses arising out of or relating to (i) the operations of Shipper, (ii) any breach of this agreement by Shipper, except to the extent attributable to the negligence, willful misconduct or fault of Transporter, and (iii) operations or activities upstream or downstream of the Gathering System, except to the extent attributable to the negligence, willful misconduct or fault of Transporter.   13.2  Transporter shall release, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Shipper and its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, consultants, representatives, and invitees from and against all claims and losses arising out of or relating to (i) the operations of Transporter and (ii) any breach of this agreement by Transporter, except to the extent attributable to the negligence, willful misconduct or fault of Shipper.   ARTICLE 14 NOTICES   14.1 Notices. Unless otherwise provided herein, any notice, request, invoice, statement, or demand which either Party desires to serve upon the other regarding this Agreement shall be made in writing and shall be considered as delivered (i) when hand delivered, (ii) when delivery is confirmed by pre-paid delivery service (such as FedEx, UPS, DHL or a similar delivery service), (iii) if mailed by United States certified mail, postage prepaid, three (3) Business Days after mailing, (iv) if sent by facsimile transmission, when receipt is confirmed by the equipment of the transmitting Party, or (v) when sent, if sent by Email. Any notice shall be given to the other Party at the following address, or to such other address as either Party shall designate by written notice to the other:   ENERGY XXI USA, INC.

(a) Shipper shall have the right to assign, or transfer all, but not less than all, of its rights and obligations under this Agreement with the prior written consent of Transporter, which consent may be withheld in Transporter's sole discretion.   (b) No assignment or transfer of this Agreement shall be effective as to Transporter unless and until Transporter has been provided written notice thereof.   15.2 Encumbrance.   (a)  Shipper shall not pledge, encumber or grant any security interest with respect to any portion of its interests or rights under this Agreement.   (b)  Transporter shall have the right to pledge, encumber or otherwise grant security interests in its interests or rights under this Agreement.   15.3  Nothing herein shall prevent or prohibit Shipper, without consent of Transporter, from engaging and using contractors and subcontractors to perform services, for the benefit of Shipper, in connection with the performance by Shipper of its obligations under this Agreement.   ARTICLE 16 MISCELLANEOUS   16.1 Applicable Laws. This Agreement is subject to, and the Parties shall comply with, all valid present and future laws, regulations, rules and orders of Governmental Authorities now or hereafter having jurisdiction over the Parties, this Agreement, or the Services performed or the facilities utilized under this Agreement.   16.2 Authorizations. The Parties hereto represent that they have all requisite corporate and/or company authorizations necessary or proper to consummate this Agreement.   16.3 Entirety. This Agreement constitutes the entirety of the understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter dealt with herein, and replaces and supersedes all prior agreements, conditions, understandings, representations and warranties made between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, whether written or oral. It is further agreed that no amendment, modification or change herein shall be enforceable, except as specifically provided for in this Agreement, unless reduced to writing and executed by both Parties.   16.4 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Jury Waiver.   (a) The validity, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas, not including any of its conflicts of law rules that would direct or refer to the laws of another jurisdiction. The Parties have allocated liability risk pursuant to this Agreement and therefore intend that no anti-indemnity law, rule or regulation apply hereto.\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (b)  The Parties agree that the appropriate, exclusive and convenient forum for any disputes between the Parties arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be in any state or federal court in Harris County, Texas, and each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such courts solely in respect of any proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement. The Parties further agree that the Parties shall not bring suit with respect to any disputes arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any court or jurisdiction other than the above specified courts.   (c) EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY DISPUTE ARISING FROM OR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.   16.5 Non-Waiver. No waiver by either Party hereto of any one or more defaults by the other in the performance of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of any other default or defaults whether of a like kind or different nature. Any delay, less than any applicable statutory period of limitations, in asserting or enforcing any rights under this Agreement, shall not be deemed a waiver of such rights. Failure of either Party to enforce any provision of this Agreement or to require performance by the other Party of any of the provisions hereof shall not be construed to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part thereof, or the right of either Party thereafter to enforce each and every provision hereof.   16.6 Severability. If any term or other provision or portion of a provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other terms and conditions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect.   16.7 Amendments. This Agreement shall not be altered or amended, except by an agreement in writing executed by all parties to this Agreement in accordance with the limited partnership agreement of Transporter.   16.8 Confidentiality.

Such notice shall request indemnification and describe the potential Losses and Claim giving rise to the request for indemnification, and provide, to the extent known and in reasonable detail, relevant details thereof. If the Indemnitor fails to give Indemnitee notice of its intention to defend any such Claim as provided in this Section 13.3.1. the Indemnitee involved shall have the right to assume the defense thereof with counsel of its choice, at the Indemnitor's expense, and defend, settle or otherwise dispose of such Claim with the consent of the Indemnitor, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 13.3.2 In the event the Indemnitor elects to assume the defense of a Claim, the Indemnitee of the Claim in question and any successor thereto shall permit Indemnitor's counsel and independent auditors, to the extent relevant, reasonable access to its books and records and otherwise fully cooperate with the Indemnitor in connection with such Claim; provided, however, that (i) the Indemnitee shall have the right fully to participate in such defense at its own expense; (ii) the Indemnitor's counsel and independent auditors shall not disclose any Confidential Information of the Indemnitee to the Indemnitor without the Indemnitee's consent; (iii) access shall only be given to the books and records that are relevant to the Claim or Losses at issue. The defense by the Indemnitor of any such actions shall not be deemed a waiver by the Indemnitee of its right to assert a Claim with respect to the responsibility of the Indemnitor with respect to the Claim or Losses in question. The Indemnitor shall not have the right to settle or compromise any Claim against the Indemnitee (that the Indemnitor has defended pursuant to this Section 13.3.2) without the consent of the Indemnitee which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No Indemnitee shall pay or voluntarily permit the determination of any Losses which is subject to any such Claim while the Indemnitor is negotiating the settlement thereof or contesting the matter, except with the prior written consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 18\n\nSource: ETON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., 10-Q, 11/14/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nCONFIDENTIAL 13.3.3 This Section 13 shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement. 14.

Cisco Customer Service may accept a Purchase Order even if some of the information required by Section 4.1 above is missing or incomplete. In relation to Services, Cisco will confirm acceptance of a Purchase Order for Services by issuing a list of Products covered by such Services (the \"Equipment List\").\n\n4.3 Distributor may defer Product shipment for up to [*****] from the original shipping date scheduled by Cisco, provided written or electronic notice (issued, in either case, by an authorized representative of Distributor) is received by Cisco at least [*****] days before the originally scheduled shipping date.

[*****] As provided in sub- section 3.2, in its discretion, Cisco may choose to make products or services which are on the Global Price List but not on the Value Added Distributor Price List available to Distributor. The prices for such products or services will be provided by Cisco to Distributor at the time Cisco makes such products available.\n\n6.2 Upon and subject to credit approval by Cisco, payment terms shall be [*****] days from shipping date. All payments shall be made in the currency in which the Price List is quoted for the applicable Purchase Order [*****].\n\n6.3 The purchase price does not include any federal, state or local taxes, or sales, use, excise, ad valorem, value-add, withholding or other taxes or duties that may be applicable to the purchase of Products. When Cisco has the legal obligation to collect such taxes, the appropriate amount shall be added to Distributor's invoice and paid by Distributor, unless Distributor provides Cisco with a valid tax exemption certificate prior to issuance of a purchase order. Such certificate must be in a form authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.\n\n6.4 Distributor is free to determine its minimum resale prices unilaterally. Distributor understands that neither Cisco nor any employee or representative of Cisco may give any special treatment (favorable or unfavorable) to Distributor as a result of Distributor's selection of minimum resale prices. No employee or representative of Cisco or anyone else has any authority to determine what Distributor's minimum resale prices for the Products must be, or to limit Distributor's pricing discretion with respect to the Products and Services.\n\n6.5 In the event any provisions of this Agreement or any other agreement between Distributor and Cisco require that Cisco grant credits to Distributor's account, Cisco will grant such credit to Distributor's account. [*****]. Cisco will only consider debit memos initially received from Distributor during the time period associated with such request, as set forth herein.\n\nAll debit memos Distributor submits to Cisco will be submitted using any method identified in 25.8, or as otherwise agreed between the parties.\n\n6.6 Except as stated in Sections 7 (Price Protection), 12 (Inventory Balance), 13 (Return of Obsolete Product), 18 (Term and Termination) or as otherwise stated herein, for all price adjustment related credits requested by the Distributor to be granted by Cisco, the\n\n6.7 Distributor must make the initial credit request to Cisco, in writing, within [*****] of the underlying point of sale transaction. Any initial credit requests submitted by the Distributor to Cisco greater than [*****] after the underlying point of sale transaction will not be honored by Cisco and Cisco will not grant such credit to Distributor.\n\n7.0 PRICE PROTECTION. 7.1 Definition: For purposes of this Section 7.0, Products \"In-Transit\" shall be defined as all Products with a particular Cisco part number shipped by Cisco to Distributor in the [*****] day period prior to the date on which Cisco announces a general price decrease for Products with such part number, excluding those Products which Distributor has received into its inventory during such [*****] day period.\n\n7.2 In the event Cisco puts into effect a general price decrease for any Product from the Value Added Distributor Price List, Cisco will provide to Distributor a price credit on any such Product on order, In Transit or in Distributor's inventory as of the effective date of the price decrease, provided that the price credit for such Product in inventory or In Transit shall not exceed the dollar value of shipments of that Product (measured by the appropriate Cisco product number) to Distributor over the preceding [*****]. Cisco will credit Distributor's account with an amount equal to the number of units of such Product in Distributor's inventory and In Transit on the effective date of a price decrease multiplied by the difference between the net price paid and the new net price. Distributor will have [*****] from the effective date of the price change to exercise protection under this program by issuing a request for credit memo with supporting documentation to Cisco. Claims for price protection submitted more than [*****] from the effective date of a price decrease will be rejected. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Product on order will receive an automatic retroactive price credit. The only inventoried Product covered under this price protection clause is Product which has been identified by Distributor to Cisco in the daily inventory reports required in sub-sub-section 17.2.2, excluding any Third-Party\n\nSource: SCANSOURCE, INC., 10-K, 8/22/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit 10.38\n\nSourced Product.

For purposes of this Agreement, all references to \"Customer\" or \"You\" therein shall refer to Distributor.\n\n9.2 Distributor shall notify Cisco promptly of any breach or suspected breach of the EULA and further agrees that it will, at Cisco's request, assist Cisco in efforts to preserve Cisco's intellectual property rights including pursuing an action against any breaching third parties.\n\n10.

Distributor will pass through to Resellers all written limited warranties provided by Cisco with Products purchased by Distributor and Distributor shall contractually require (in whatever manner Distributor deems appropriate) each such Reseller to provide such warranty and other terms to any End User to which the Reseller redistributes the Product.\n\n10.2 In addition to the written limited warranty provided by Cisco with its Products, such warranty statement shall apply to Distributor during the period between when it receives a Product and when it resells or redistributes such Product,\n\n10.3 Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, Cisco's sole and exclusive warranty and obligation with respect to the Products sold hereunder are set forth in Cisco's Limited Warranty Statement delivered with the Product. Distributor SHALL NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTY COMMITMENT, WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL, ON CISCO'S BEHALF. Distributor shall indemnify Cisco against any warranties made in addition to Cisco's standard warranty and for any misrepresentation of Cisco's reputation or Cisco's Products.\n\n10.4 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

A transfer occurs when: (1) the original or authorized subsequent licensee tries to convey or reassign its right to use the Software to another entity, or (2) the original lessor of Cisco used hardware (including bundled Software) (\"Hardware\") tries to reassign the original lessee's right to use the Software to another lessee, or the lessor tries to convey or reassign its right to lease the Hardware and Software bundle to another lessor. A rental would be treated the same as the lease situation as described in item 2 above.\n\nThis policy applies to all Software whether Standalone or Embedded. Standalone Software is Software which is not required to operate the Hardware upon which it resides (i.e., ICSG software such as call center, unified messaging, network management software). Embedded Software is Software which is incorporated into the Hardware and is required for its operation (i.e., operating system software, certain features of IOS).\n\nPolicy:\n\nCisco's policy is that Software, whether Standalone or Embedded, is not transferable, except where a listed exception below applies, and except, of course, where Cisco's contract expressly allows it. Any other transfers will require the payment of a new license fee (see Global Price List). For products where there is no separate line item for the Software (i.e. the prices for both the Hardware and Software are bundled), and therefore, a fee cannot be determined, an exception will be made to allow for the transfer without the customer being required to obtain a new license (the customer may be required to pay an inspection fee), if (A) Software to be transferred (i) will be under a support contract provided by either Cisco or a Cisco\u200b\u2010 authorized support partner or (ii) is still supported by Cisco; or (B) approval from the theatre Sales Controller has been obtained.\n\nUse of the Software will be governed by either the original license terms and conditions in place between Cisco and the original Software licensee or by the new license between Cisco and the new user. Cisco may withhold its consent to any transfer not conforming to this policy.\n\nLicense Fee:\n\nThe License Fee is generally the same amount as the fee charged for a new license or a portion of the fee of a new license, unless otherwise noted on the Global Price List.\n\nIt is the obligation of the transferor to obtain Cisco's consent and/or a new license before the transfer occurs.\n\nExceptions:\n\nProvided the conditions of transfer are met as set forth below, the follow exceptions apply to the prohibition against transfer without written approval and payment of the applicable fee. These exceptions may be overridden by express terms in an applicable licensing agreement governing the transferability of Special License Software (Special License Software is the term now used in our templates to refer to ICSG Product)\n\nAffiliate: An entity may transfer its right to use a certain piece of Software to its Affiliate. An Affiliate is another entity where at least 50.1% of its voting power is owned or controlled by the transferring entity or where as least 50.1% of the transferring entity's voting power is owned or controlled by the transferee.\n\nMerger or Acquisition: An entity may transfer its right to use a certain piece of Software to the purchaser of all or substantially all of the capital stock of the transferor or all or substantially all of the assets of that portion of the transferor's business to which those licenses pertain. Lease: In a leasing situation where the original lessee/customer would like to buy out the equipment from the leasing company during or at the end of the lease term, the original lessee/customer may retain the license without paying a new License Fee, provided leasing company gives Cisco prior written notice. Also, if the original lessee/customer defaults under the lease and the leasing company takes the equipment back before the end of the lease term, the leasing company may transfer the license to the another lessee for the remainder of the original lease term, without paying Cisco a License Fee, upon 30 days' prior written notice to Cisco, or as soon as practicable if the equipment is re-leased before such 30- day period. If the new lease term is in\n\nSource: SCANSOURCE, INC., 10-K, 8/22/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit 10.38\n\nexcess of the original lease term, the leasing company is expected to pay Cisco a new License Fee on or before the expiration date of the original lease term. [NOTE: In the situation where a leasing company leases Cisco equipment to Customer A for a specified term and at the end of the lease term, the leasing company desires to lease the same equipment to Customer B, leasing company may not transfer the license without obtaining a new license from Cisco.)].\n\nOutsource: Customer desires to outsource the operation, support and maintenance of its network to a third party (e.g. EDS) (\"Third-Party Service Provider\"), for the benefit of that customer. As part of the outsourcing, customer transfers all of its rights, title and interest to the assets, including certain Cisco products and software licenses, to the Third-Party Service Provider. Customer may transfer the license to the Third-Party Service Provider solely for the purposes of providing services to Customer upon 30 days' prior written notice to Cisco.\n\nAll notices should be sent to sw-license@cisco.com or as indicated in the agreement between Cisco and the customer or transferor, if any.\n\nConditions of Transfer:\n\nTransfers, in any event, shall only be allowed under the following conditions:\n\n\u25e6 The parties involved in the transfer are not in breach of the agreement governing the use of the Software or any other agreement with Cisco;\n\n\u25e6 Any additional services or charges incurred by Cisco as the result of any transfer shall be borne by the transferor and transferee; and\n\n\u25e6 The parties involved in the transfer shall provide written prior notice of a permitted transfer to Cisco and the transferee shall, in a writing to Cisco, (i) assume all of the obligations of the transferor, and (ii) agree that transferee's use of the Software shall be governed by the terms of the then-current license agreement between Cisco and transferor or, at Cisco's sole discretion, by the terms of Cisco's then-current standard license agreement.\n\nQuestions?\n\nAny questions or comments regarding this policy should be sent to sw-license@cisco.com.\n\nSource: SCANSOURCE, INC., 10-K, 8/22/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit 10.38\n\nEXHIBIT G\n\nCisco End of Life Policy\n\nProducts reach the end of their Product Life Cycle for a number of reasons. These reasons may be due to market demands, technology innovation and development driving changes in the product, or the products simply mature over time and are replaced by functionally richer technology. While this is an established part of the overall product life cycle, Cisco Systems recognizes that end-of-life milestones often prompt companies to review the way in which such end-of-sale and end-of-life milestones impact the Cisco products in their networks. With that in mind, we have set out below Cisco's end-of-life policy to help customers better manage their end-of-life transition and to understand the role that Cisco can play in helping to migrate to alternative Cisco platforms and technology.\n\nThe End of Life Policy only applies to End of Life and End of Sale announcements made in all Theaters on or after November 30, 2002 for all Cisco product lines. The Policy does not apply to product that is already subject to an End of Life and/or End of Sale announcement. The general policy guidelines are:\n\n1. As a general rule, Cisco will provide 6 months' notice of the affected product's end-of-sale date and/or the last day when the affected product can be ordered. This notice will appear on Cisco.com site (http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/prod_end_of_life.html) and we encourage you to visit this site regularly as it contains useful information regarding Cisco's end-of-life program. Sign up to receive notification here: http://www.cisco.com/pcgi-bin/Support/FieldNoticeTool/field-notice\n\n2. Access to Cisco's Technical Assistance Center (TAC) will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week for a period of 5 years from the end-of-sale date for hardware and operating system software issues and for a period of 3 years from the end-of-sale date for application software issues.\n\n3. Spares or replacement parts for hardware will be available for a period of 5 years from the end-of\u200b sale date. We will provide spares and replacement parts in accordance with our Return Materials Authorization (RMA) process.\n\n4. Software support will be as follows\n\na. For the first year following the end-of-sale date, we will provide bug fixes, maintenance releases, workarounds, or patches for critical bugs reported via the TAC or Cisco.com Web site.\n\nb. After the first year and for Operating System SW -where available- we will provide bug fixes, maintenance releases, workarounds or patches for a period of 4 years for operating system software. Bear in mind that it may be necessary to use software upgrade release to correct a reported problem.\n\nc. After the first year and for Application SW -where available - we will provide bug fixes, maintenance releases, workarounds or patches for a period of 2 years for application software. Bear in mind that it may be necessary to use software upgrade release to correct a reported problem.\n\n5. You will need to ensure that you have a current and fully paid support contract with Cisco. Please contact your Support Account Manager regarding fees payable during the end-of-life period so that we can support you right through the end-of-life transition period.\n\n6. Below are guidelines that should be followed to ensure that you receive effective support for the affected products within your network:\n\na. For hardware or software that is not covered under a service contract, customers may add the product(s) to a current contract or purchase a new contract until 12 months after the end-of-sale date.\n\nb. Service contracts that have not been renewed or have lapsed after 12 months of end-of\u200b sale date are not re-newable.\n\nc. Renewal of your service contract will generally be available until the last year of support, but will not extend\n\nSource: SCANSOURCE, INC., 10-K, 8/22/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit 10.38\n\nbeyond the last date of support.\n\nThe end-of-life milestones and Cisco commitments are presented in Table 1.\n\nTable 1.

The end-of-life process consists of a series of technical and business milestones and activities that, once completed, make a product obsolete. Once obsolete, the product is not sold, manufactured, improved, repaired, maintained, or supported.\n\nEnd-of-sale date: The last date to order the product through Cisco point-of-sale mechanisms. The product is no longer for sale.\n\nHardware: The physical product and its physical components.\n\nOperating System Software: Cisco operating system software that runs on Cisco hardware Application software: Cisco software that requires the presence of some non-Cisco operating system software.\n\nSoftware Maintenance support: The time period that Cisco may release any software maintenance releases or bug fixes to the software product. After this date, Cisco Engineering will no longer develop, repair, maintain, or test the product software.\n\nSource: SCANSOURCE, INC., 10-K, 8/22/2019"}]}, {"title": "CardlyticsInc_20180112_S-1_EX-10.16_11002987_EX-10.16_Maintenance Agreement1", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"answers": [{"text": "Software License, Customization and Maintenance Agreement", "answer_start": 1679}], "id": "CardlyticsInc_20180112_S-1_EX-10.16_11002987_EX-10.16_Maintenance Agreement1__Document Name", "question": "The name of the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "Bank of America, N.A.", "answer_start": 642}, {"text": "Supplier", "answer_start": 737}, {"text": "Bank of America", "answer_start": 642}, {"text": "Cardlytics, Inc.", "answer_start": 384}], "id": "CardlyticsInc_20180112_S-1_EX-10.16_11002987_EX-10.16_Maintenance Agreement1__Parties", "question": "The two or more parties who signed the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "11/4/10", "answer_start": 360}], "id": "CardlyticsInc_20180112_S-1_EX-10.16_11002987_EX-10.16_Maintenance Agreement1__Agreement Date", "question": "The date of the contract", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "11/4/10", "answer_start": 360}], "id": "CardlyticsInc_20180112_S-1_EX-10.16_11002987_EX-10.16_Maintenance Agreement1__Effective Date", "question": "The date when the contract is effective\u00a0", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [{"text": "This Agreement shall apply and remain in effect from the Effective Date and perpetually thereafter unless terminated pursuant to the Section entitled \"Termination.\"", "answer_start": 26242}], "id": "CardlyticsInc_20180112_S-1_EX-10.16_11002987_EX-10.16_Maintenance Agreement1__Expiration Date", "question": "On what date will the contract's initial term expire?", "is_impossible": false}, {"answers": [], "id": "CardlyticsInc_20180112_S-1_EX-10.16_11002987_EX-10.16_Maintenance Agreement1__Renewal Term", "question": "What is the renewal term after the initial term expires?

Each Party hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of such state, and waives any objection to venue with respect to actions brought in such courts. This provision shall not be construed to conflict with the provisions of the Section entitled \"Mediation/Arbitration.\"    Proprietary to Bank of America  Page 27  vTIP2010\n\nSource: CARDLYTICS, INC., S-1, 1/12/2018\n\n\n\n\n\n36.0 DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n36.1 The following procedure will be adhered to in all disputes arising under this Agreement which the Parties cannot resolve informally through their Relationship Managers.

The Relationship Managers shall meet (in person or by telephone) within seven (7) calendar days (or other mutually agreed upon date) after the date of the written notification to reach an agreement about the nature of the deficiency and the corrective action to be taken by the respective Parties.

If Management do not meet or cannot resolve the dispute or agree upon a written plan of corrective action to do so within seven (7) calendar days (or other mutually agreed upon date) after their initial meeting or other action, or if the agreed-upon completion dates in the written plan of corrective action are exceeded, either Party may request mediation and/or arbitration as provided for in this Agreement. Except as otherwise specifically provided, neither Party shall initiate arbitration, mediation or litigation unless and until this dispute resolution procedure has been substantially compiled with or waived. Failure of a Party to fulfill its obligations in this Section, including failure to meet timely upon the other Party's notice, shall be deemed such a waiver.\n\n  37.0 MEDIATION/ARBITRATION\n\n37.1 If the Parties are unable to resolve a dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement in accordance with the Section entitled \"Dispute Resolution,\" the Parties will in good faith attempt to resolve such dispute through non-binding mediation. The mediation shall be conducted before a mediator acceptable to both sides, who shall be an attorney or retired judge practicing in the areas of banking and/or information technology law. The mediation shall be held In Charlotte, N.C., provided, however, a dispute relating to infringement of Intellectual Property Rights or the Section entitled \"Confidentiality and Information Protection\" shall not be subject to this Section entitled \"Mediation/Arbitration.\"\n\n37.2 Any controversy or claim, other than those specifically excluded, between or among the Parties not resolved through mediation under the preceding provision, shall at the request of a Party be determined by arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted by one independent arbitrator who shall be an attorney or retired judge practicing in the areas of banking and/or Information technology law. The arbitration shall be held in Charlotte, N.C. in accordance with the United States Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), notwithstanding any choice of law provision in this Agreement, and under the auspices and the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.\n\n37.3 Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, each Party will, upon the written request of the other Party, promptly provide the other with copies of documents relevant to the issues raised by any claim or counterclaim on which the producing Party may rely in support of or in opposition to any claim or defense. At the request of a Party, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to order examination by deposition of witnesses to the extent the arbitrator deems such additional discovery relevant and appropriate. Depositions shall be limited to a maximum of three (3) per Party and shall be held within thirty (30) calendar days of the making of a request. Additional depositions may be scheduled only with the permission of the arbitrator, and for good cause shown. Each deposition shall be limited to a maximum of three (3) hours duration. All objections are reserved for the arbitration hearing except for objections based on privilege and proprietary or confidential information.

The arbitrator shall follow the law in reaching a reasoned decision and shall deliver a written opinion setting forth findings of fact, conclusions of law and the rationale for the decision. The arbitrator shall reconsider the decision once upon the motion and at the expense of a Party. The Section of this Agreement entitled \"Confidentiality and Information Protection\" shall apply to the arbitration proceeding, all evidence taken, and the arbitrator's opinion, which shall be Confidential Information of both Parties. Judgment upon the decision rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.\n\n37.5 No provision of this Section shall limit the right of a Party to obtain provisional or ancillary remedies from a court of competent jurisdiction before, after, or during the pendency of any arbitration. The exercise of a remedy does not waive the right of either Party to resort to arbitration. The institution and maintenance of an action for judicial relief or pursuit of a provisional or ancillary remedy shall not constitute a waiver of the right of either Party to submit the controversy or claim to arbitration if the other Party contests such action for judicial relief.\n\n  38.0 NON-EXCLUSIVE NATURE OF AGREEMENT\n\n38.1 Supplier agrees that it shall not be considered Bank of America's exclusive provider of any goods or services provided hereunder.
